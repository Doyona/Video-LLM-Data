Now that was just rude?
😂 please
*Andy* clearly only loves cooking for *Babe.*
Sister in law👍👍👍
"Sister in laws🙄" - so relatable😂
Those look delicious 😋
Does bro have the entire population of animals in his fridge
I haven't got any in-laws, but even I felt that sigh
Anyone else feel guilty for a moment for not having cooked lobsters in their fridge?  Then I remembered that his fridge is stocked like an Aladdin's cave. #Or is it?!
Your smile is missing when you open the fridge door😅
To many ppl forget it is staged, i swear.
Me tryna figure out witch one is witch
See I’m petty bc I would have been like “is your name babe?!”
Nice santoku ☺️
OMG master cheff  living with nicer family....also beautiful girls
🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
It seemed like you didn’t want to do cook it
Love those manners
Simp
Did you use the meat from the legs as well?
Dude needs to as the segment where he hits 5 different grocery stores for all of these outlandish requests
I could feel the "anger" lol
I could've sworn he was talking to his wife
😂
If someone has to be told to say please they don't eat.
Hahaha
I really would like to hang out with him have a beer or two
Gyros
I love THIS guy!
The fact that he is damn excited to cook whatever his wife says and the level of frustration he has with the sister in law.. love the elegance in their humor
Another link on the ole ball and chain, my friend 😂 looks delicious though
It’s not often I see YouTube chefs taste the food while they make it
Ah yes, I always just happen to have lobster in the fridge 😁
I feel that they use him to much
Jarred mayo!? SIL must have pissed him off!
Who is the third person that lives with them that films all of these?
Do people in Australia just commonly keep lobster in the refrigerator at all time like chicken or beef?
Gives babes sister the lobster guts 🤣 mmm delicious
Sister in law seems sooooooo lovely. What a joy to be around. 😅
True... "Sister in law"..🥸
Y’all married but neither one of you wear a ring 💍
Show more of the dogs too in your shorts please 🐕
He said it perfectly 😂😂😂
Why your raw lobster look so healthy? In my country it’s soggy
Do you have a baby?
The frustration is visible in the speed 😂
What did she say? Get a chankla to the dome piece, say something else!
I love this channel! But where is the recipes as usual?
I love that they emphasized the “please” never forget.
I’m allergic to lobsters but that may be worth pulling out my epi-pen! 🤤 😅😂🤪
Scripted
The ones at Christmas were bigger
Either we are neighbors, or family members…..
More lemon indeed 😋🤞
Please! (I've commented before on that...) Well done, good manners! ...also yummo as!
Sister in laws? More like lazy wife
This mf better be getting world class bjs from his wife on demand.
Its oky chef everything is just fine
My sister in law is a feral slag and she hates me. But I’m f’n her little sister
I'd give ANYTHING to have him cook for me lol..
One of those babe I love you but.  Why is she here again??
I just want one of those cool little Frenchies! 😆
Haha I'm fatherless get owned!...man I feel the sudden urge to go onto picrew and make a picture with the pride flag behind it
What would you want? “Caviar” Bruh
Please share your recipes.
Nice house by the river/ beach? Gold Coast? When will there a house tour video ? Look forward cheers 🎉
Liking the comedy elements to the videos 😂
They were able to come to a decision this time
Your woman does nothing
Not even a thank you what a cow
NOT MR.CRABS
Your wife cheating mate. U is good guy tho.
Using tails instead of claw and knuckles!
Lobster Rolls Looks Delicious. But Why Do Women Always Have To Complain About Size? 😁
I'd Like You To Make A Rustic Cracker Breaded Fried Thick Cut Pork Chop And Mashed Potato And Spinach Dinner.
Oi giving the lobster a nice back crack massage
I never liked this style of lobster rolls..(im in New England so).. give me a bigg mound of lobster meat, esp the claw meat, and a bunch of ghee or clarified butter
I don't think he will be making her anything else anytime soon
Yup he is getting a shit ton of problems after this video's
What! Do you not cook the lobster meat!
Please
🤣🤣🤣🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
Oooo I've been waiting to see this one!
*more lemon*
Uhh actually the correct way is "sisters in law" not "sister in laws"
Waste of a good lobster 🦞 😒 Did you ever cook them on the grill?  Yummy ❣️  Of course,  this is my opinion 😋
Yum !!!both are spoilt not just sister in law both !! Give some to puppies too !!! ❤🎉🎉🎉❤
You posted a short that said every video has the recipe in the description....I've seen a few that don't including this one
I wonder if this guy ever just says "Hell no" and throws some corn dogs in the microwave
That is a crayfish
It’s got nothing to do with the label or “sister in law” that girl just doesn’t have any manners. I’m a “sister in law” and I know how to say please 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
First time I've ever heard you muttered under your breath
The female-“The ones on Christmas were biggah.”   Me- “That’s a weird way of saying thanks.”
Should’ve made crab cakes instead
Two 3s make a 6, not bad I guess.
Andy like bitch if you don’t knock it off Lmao
huh women ☕
Second video I've seen of this. It's a wonder her ass isn't a meter wide.
It’s actually sisters in law but I get you! 😂
Hilarious
Hahaha that'd never happen with 'Mate'
You australians, English and americans , dont know , how to Cook seafood. You take all of its flavour, by stufing it full of spices, and souces.
Lol
So I'm not the only one that happens to have lobsta just chillin' in the fridge.
I thought your sister-in-law said "grab me a beer!"
Is it just me or does anyone else wish lobster rolls came hot?  Idk why but the cold lobster or crab rolls just seem lacking when cold. I'm probably so alone in this lol.
Sure you wasn’t smaller for christmas?
Hahahaha..... yes I agree with eye1158. They should cook your favorite MEAL !!!!
Do kiwis wear glasses?
Babe don’t let your sister talk to Andy like that lol😊
Homie can be doing so much better!!
Andy the new age slave simp
Bug meat rolls
Surprise you didn’t show you catching the lobster first 😮
I love your sister in law 😂 Her comedic timing is on point
Talk about rude..
what about the face?
Simp
Simp
She. Is rude.  You tell her. All that cooking. She hardly says please 😊
Those poor dogs must be starving. Never any leftovers from Andy's cooking.
“What do you want for lunch?” “Lobster rolls” *picks up lobster trap*
This came up in my recommendations and although I would love lobster roll I would equally love you to make rappie pie please
Ur cooking always lukz nyc. If u can plz add notes as to what n hw much u add to ur fud
I love how touchy babe is about no one else bossing you 🤣🤣
You are hilarious!
Babe never says please
You don't boss hubbylish around, that's my job 😂😂😂😂
This is what we call angry cooking .
Sister in laws: "I want lobster rolls" Me: "Go get it yourself u lazy ****!" 💯🤣
At least your sister in law don’t try to set you up
Only thing my brother in law gave me was 8 more reasons to wish I was a lesbian. She’s lucky
You said babe why she answered for that🤔
Omg . He's amazing . Great chef n hubby.  What does she do ? Lol
Why the sister respond to babe tho? 👀👀👀
Andy’s knife skills are out of this world!
When the wife's sister responds faster to his "hey babe" 🤣
FYI.  It is “sisters in law”  Not sister-in-law’s.🇦🇺🇦🇺
She got that baby gave alright
sister in law: “i want lobster rolls”   chef: “then go make them yourself”   chef: “babe what do you want?”   babe: “i want lobster rolls”  chef: “sure thing babe”  😂😂😂
Got be a player and clap the sister in laws cheeks to 😎
At least in this video there’s a please and a thank you! 😅
Can we have three some food.
How about a warm lobster roll?  A brown butter tarragon-infused sauce 😋
Those rolls reminded me of canes
Where's that babes cooking for you video at 1mil?👀
There was some real frustration in that chop brother. Lol
That attitude at the end. Jesus Christ.
My only criticism is that you used “Praise” mayo 😢
No thank you
🤣🤣🤣🤣LUV❤️your face🤣”sister in law” 🤣🤣🤣
Rip lobster
You do have lobster. Lobster mac-n-cheese next!
It's amazing how effective and important are good manners and signs of appreciation. You go, Babe! Well done.
You said more lemon, I thought you said whatever lol like seasoning whatever she better like this
Faints...nom, nom  nom nom
This man is making so much money just by making his wife food and you feel bad for him 😂😂😂 I work in a restaurant and make food for people all day I would love to have this man's life
I wouldn’t make anything for her ungrateful sister ever again
Poor Andy in the end walking back to the kitchen sad and tired 😹
For me maybe have a brie of cook a poikey
which type of lobster roll is your favorite mayo or butter based
I want that fridge. You can pull out anything that you wanna eat tonight. It's so magical!
Anybody gon' tell him it's sisters in law?
She seems more like a meatloaf, Mac and cheese and a gallon of heavy cream type of girl
I totally agree Sister in Laws 😡‼️
A New England favorite buddy. We can charge $38 for that thing out here, even if it’s frozen!
nope, no seafood, goto red lobster !
F yeah looks great chef!!
The disrespect I felt seeing her not be stoked having her plate brought to her
No claws?
The ones at Christmas were bigger omg
Slave drivers I tell you.
Sister in law🤣
I want a lobster roll, please Jiju…. 😂 Indians will get it😂😂
I do same thing everytime i have a cooked lobster crowding my fridge
I know this was supposed to be funny, but the ungratefulness seemed so genuine. It just made me wish that as soon as she went to take a bite, you slapped it out of her hand. Now that would've been funny.
*Chef married the right sistahhh*
Don't give that jackass sister-in-law nothing
And he just happens to have a lobster in the fridge!
Uncooked lobster 🦞
Lol the please 😂
Total setup. The menu is pre-decided and them ladies just say it out.
No one mentioned the use of rock over Maine?
Babe is one lucky gal.
Look what you guys did! Blasted them in previous videos now they intentionally have to film it now 😂
sir this making process ,in ur daily life,or only for video, anyway ur ar genius 👏👏👏
They HAVE to be twins for sure
Why did the sister in law answer?
Sister in law... Fucking doesn't even know to say.... Thanks you.. they are the worst in the world....
This man is awesome! love your channel 👍
Anybody else ever think about what his fridge looks like on the inside like is it infinite
Back home is ladies who normally cook lol
My sister in law isn’t a problem….but I’m also not a badass chef either, lol
Funny how a year ago people were beefin on wife for not saying please and thank you xD
€25 a plate. Just a casual lunch
Yummy
Don't you have to cook lobster :O
No thanks no matter
Uncooked lobster??
Sister n law is a b
First the wife, then the sister in law, telling u what to cook, when r u going to wake up and tell them to cook for themselves, why would u keep a lazy ass wife like that?
Is it Raw lobster 🦞???
I'm secretly trying to hook up with my sister in law
Jesus Murphy the entitlement on both of these miserable women’s faces.
Never forget your manners!
A lobster roll consists of lobster seasoning and mayonnaise. Not all that other crap.
Yessss perfectly done ..brilliant
White ppl💀
When you love your wife ... Anything is possible... Or doable 😂😂😂
Lolol the "please" in total response to his other video I'm dying 😂
Is this a raw lobster? I am asking cos I haven’t had it before so asking out of curiosity!
What men will do for some f****** p**** oh my God Lord help us
He complained for making such simple dish !? Bro your wife asked you to make more hard dishes for her or like entire party and you eagerly run to the fridge without nagging
Do y’all clean your cutting board as you go? just bleach wipes or what?
Hey babe you got a good husband
😂 sis-in-law
Mastar chef woww
😂😂❤
Sister in law but I've never seen a ring on any of you
Where I live (Rhode Island) this is street food but we also use local bugs to the area like chef Andy here is using.
I love your videos
bro ingredients plzz
what accent is that? sounds nice.. I'm thinking Aussie..I maybe wrong
These videos piss me off... His wife needs a channel where she's giving him head, cleaning the damn house or doing SOMETHING for this man!
"ones at christmas were bigger" you would say something like that wouldnt you karen.
You know how we know these are staged? Because she knows what she wants to eat every time he asks.
Why is it that it’s men now a days who know how to cook and woman can barely put water in a pot and make craft Mac and cheese?
I like the word please. Much better.
Onlar kicini yaysinlar ....kopek mamasi bile cok inlara ugrasma reiss
🤣🤣🤣 im dying here 😭 🤣 😂
Amazing how he always has the ingredients ready
Lobsters are not gonna get cooked , like not even steamed?
Yum ❤️
I like that thing....when it's your wife you re like "yess..." but others...." ugh"
blasphemy 🤦🏽 eat lobster the way it was intended. straight out of the shell
Chef: What do you want for Lunch? Sister in Law: ooh I want a menage a trois.
Wow. Something I think I can make  ,finally.
Someday you will say ugh god damn it she does nothing 🤣
Love ur content bro 😎😎😎
Rouladen
When every your sister-in-law as you to cook. Hand her the bill plus tips :🤠
Is it weird that I couldn’t tell them apart? Are they twins?!
Hello there. Those rolls look lovely. Lobster is very expensive where I come from in the UK. You can buy frozen lobster but they are not very good.
U asked the bitch 😂😂😂
Can I be your apprentice
I just want to know what my man’s grocery runs/bills look like!
He’s mad his sister in law said thanks you lol
Here in “New” England we do them a little different
Did he have cooked lobster in the fridge? I know he's a chef but is that the norm?
That’s not a lobster
Am I right that wife’s sister was disrespectful?
man, if you're being held hostage, let us know!😂
Sisters r like twins…
I am Amazed lemon zest was not in the mix.
One day you should tell them someone’s going to have to run to the store hahaa
I am a man but I need a husband like Andy btw I'm not gay
Those chicks??? What fkn good are they??
Sister in laws  lol
Her face really makes me never want to see her again!
I usualy skip this part
Where do I buy the magic refrigerator that always has the necessary ingredients for any particular recipe?
Sister in laws... i feel yah! Hahaha
Look at all the puppies. It's like a huge pile of love 😍
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Keep me away from him! You lucky.. lucky girl!!!❤❤❤❤

Sister in law’s boyfriend should cook. Oh…what…he left her?
Just do a three way, problem solved.
I’m starting to hate these
Nothing like a 3" lobster roll, that took 45 minutes.
I like a good mixture for my lobster rolls    This looks great
💙💛💚🥰🦞😲🙃😄🥰🦞💙💛💚

Yummy

Just say no. Stop acting like a hero.
Gross .precooked lobster . You might as well pull that out of a plastic tin
That's RAW
That wasn‘t lobster ☝🏼
Man, you could feel that "sister- in- laws" come from the depth of his soul hahaha!
Ghorme sabzi
BRUH I like to keep the lobster simple on the roll seeing that scares me 😂 more of a just butter or slight mayo kinda guy
I have always lobster in my fridge. No problem! Ask me ever you want.
Ah but don’t stop y’all going places
Love lobster 🦞 rolls and they look so good !!!
Working on please and thank you? Good!
Love the channel, terrified of crustaceans
Did anybody else hear 'talking to the moooooooooon' in the background??
He is a rrally good cooket
Puts ricin in the sister roll
Nah.
Why do you ruin delicious lobster by putting mayo on it???
Lobster very expensive but so delicious to eat. Amazing sounds great.
wow Andy is a winner
videos are nice but i am curious and uneasy about the set up of the hubby perpetually asking what the wife wants to eat.Never has the role reversed!
One said thanks, the other complained about the size.
Bet Babe has no problem finding friends…LOL!
Love it, your cooking is fabulous 😊
Fried chicken please🥺
I hate your vids you make every other man look like a complete POS
so weird how you somehow have their requests in the fridge!  wow!
Can you smoke Babes sister up side her head🤷‍♀️🤣🤣🤣🤣
What if he doesn’t have the ingredients that they want? 😳😬
Poli

Please & Thank You! I couldn’t believe my ears, I fell off my seat !
Looks delicious Makes Me hungry.
plot twist the wife is fi;ming it all even tho it appears she chilling outdoors
❤you can come for a visit anytime!
I used to think the girlfriend was so lazy and then I wondered who was shooting the content. Maybe it’s her? Lol but if it’s not do the dishes or something babes.
The fact that she always knows what she wants to eat is 🤌
@andycooks. How do you stay so tidy while cooking? My kitchen looks like a bomb went off when o cook.
least you got a thank you from the babe .... the other one .. eehh
Free loading ass sister yelling bout lobster 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣...  and still didn't say thank you
"Oh I want lobster rolls!" Are you BABE?
Ho  Wife asks: *excitement* Sister in law: *nemesis has entered the chat*
One thing that runs in my mind in every video as an Indian(as a person who doesn't even care abt calories intake)," Is that quantity enough for a meal???"
i mean your babes sister
are you sure your sister doesnt have a crush on you
If it was not for the subtitles I could never understand a single word this chic says it's nuts
I love how no matter what they ask for its always in the fridge.
Feel your pain mate
Please n Thank you 👍
That is one ungrateful sister in law
Cause everybody has a lobster ready in their fridge
Holy shit these people and that accent are unbearable.
You just happen to have lobster in the fridge. 🤔
Why do you throw the one part of the green onion in the ice? Just curious  Looks amazing
Wishing', This', We're (Perfectly'), Satisfying', ('Can't Wait'), Too' Seek' M'y Teeth's OF'), Quite' Freshly' Made', Tastied' Heavenly', (OF') Greatness's".)!
He’s definitely gonna get laid tonight
Looks really good 👍
WHAT BREAD IS THAT
Try COZIDO Á PORTUGUESA
Would be willing to post the recipe? I love lobster rolls and can’t find any good ones. Plus I think homemade is better.
Looks delicious! Some of us 'Mericans would say lobster rolls are better from the knuckle not the tail. More meat and less expensive but no shade. Luv the videos!
Baby sister seemed a bit surprised by the fact that you had everything on hand to whip it up and serve it. You’re just the food dispensers on Star Trek enterprise.
That's raw
I love how you had a lobster all ready to go on a whim
Ok but just because that’s his wife or whatever doesn’t mean she doesn’t have to be polite and just SAY A SIMPLE THANK YOU
Yep sister in laws..
I think that lobster would hate u for this
"I thought lobster 🦞 rolls were bigger" 😭 they really should be bigger. ❤️
Good job bro
YOU ARE THE BEST 🤗🤗🤗
Glad you have the proper New England style hot dog buns 👍
Is her name Lisa
Would have been funny if you came back to take the plate. “Like fine I’ll eat them “ lol
What did the sister in law say at the end?
Can i be your next customer chef
I love how she checked her sister
The prettiest lobster roll I ever did see!!!!
YUMMY
Love the uploads!
Lmao the wonderful tales of Lobsters..... used to be so worthless people literally used them to feed prisoners. Now it's extremely overpriced because white people gentrified the hell out of it
Can't be calling out your sister when you rarely if ever thank the man yourself, hypocrite
Unroll those eyes, sir, this channel is about your cooking skills.
What knives do you use
Why  is ur babe telling your sister to say please when she never does
حلاب راجل هذا غلاو علينا شربة
He said babe and she responded. That's sus
Sisters-in-law  NOT Sister-in-laws
when sister in laws treat you like their husbands but aint giving up no cheeks lol
I love how he's so happy to cook for his wife but when someone else is asking he's like urgh
I want lobster rolls too! No onions please. 😊
I always thought lobster rolls were so fancy. And that’s all it takes to make one!!! I know the imitation crab isn’t the best but idk where to get fresh lobster. But imma try to make this. That’s it!? Just mayo and lemon
Yes! Why don’t you take a break from cooking. I want to see your wife cook for you
soo goood🥰
Should have been: " What kind of store bought nut butter and store bought fruit jam do you want on the store bought bread slices?
Song name?
🤣🤣I love him, but for some reason I think the sister in law kinda made his food preparation more aggressive.. almost like he didn't want to do it....🤣
So the sister-in-law responds to him saying "babe"?  🤔
есть захотелось:)
Lmfao ! She says please! 😆
Did he just put raw onions and celery in that? No thanks
"Ughh sister in laws" 🙄🤭😂🤣
Sister in law is really hot 😂😂
Sister would have to cook for herself or order out. LOL.
Lol oh well it's not Christmas 🎄
Is sister in law single?
Yo I’m super impressed....I remember first watching and feeling both females could do with some manner classes. Noice. Just being descent and well mannered goes a long way. Keep up the good work Chef🤙💯
No claws?
Goan fish curry ....love from goa 🔥
Would love to see her cook for you one day😂😂😂
Just happen to have a cooked lobster in the fridge lol
"Only I get to order him around like my personal servant"
You’re a feeder and it’s starting to show… Babes.. x
FINALLY SOME MANNERS!!!!!
Buddy, it is sisters-in-law. 😝  Love your channel.
props for the flat sided New england style rolls
What if her sister saw this though👁️👄👁️
Raw
Haha I just found a thank you all this saved I take back everything
I don't get the problem, it's not like she asked for Pho or pickles pork gumbo.
Please cook Khoresht Gormeh Sabzi 👍🏼
THE AUDACITY
As someone from New England. That’s a good looking lobster roll.  But as someone from Connecticut The birth place of the lobster roll. All you need is some warm butter poured over it
U are a very loving & caring Husband...Hope u got a Chance to relax for urself like she cook for u 1 Wk & u just relax....😘
put the name of the ingredients
Don't use mayonnaise with lobster, I know it's traditional somehow but they don't really go together.
look he made them and thats all that counts! its not that the "ones at christmas were bigger" give him a break ok?
Man tell ur lady she has to cook for u boys
Salmon and tuna poke with a nice sauce?
Why did she answer
At least her sister remembered her manners
Wish I was babe man, food must be good 😔
I want lobster rolls pulls out a celery
Service with a smile!  I’d love to see what kind of seasoning you use.  I prefer the Maine lobster 🦞, but one can’t be too picky!
"PLEASE "🤩🤩
Doesn't everyone have a lobster in the fridge..
Make her say please again, like she means it, then tip you when she's done eating.
FOR LUNCH?
Sister looking so much better than boring Baby chief cook!
Ya get what ya get and you don’t be a bitch
At least they thanked him this time🤣
First time I didn't see him smile after she told him what she wants lol
What a waste of lobster
Good job you had a fully cooked lobster ready.
It was babe who directed her sister to say "please" 🙄🙄🙄🤷🤷🤷
She nasty and a hater
She gone cheat on him 🤣
pampering wifes is death sentence to your self-respect and personal lifes
O 😻 💕🍾😘
los que vivimos a orillas del mar sabemos que la langosta es de la carne mas seca y sin sabor.... haaa pero los citadinos creen que es la ultima coca del desierto XD
Him: "Sister in laws" Me: ah EXCUSE me, it's sisterS in law, thank you
lol, its hilarious when they act ungrateful
Babe good (please)
Wow you guys got so many dogs 🐾🐾
So, we can't hire you for a meal?  Some lobster rolls?
You’re a good man ❤️💯
Food bitch!
Delicious and such a respectful treatment of the lobster in the salad. A special thanks for including my favorite touch: a grilled, top-split roll! (The way us New Englanders do it here in the States!)
Lobster rolls are great but i need like 6 to fill me up and they cost like $40
IT AINT CHRISTMAS BABE
কাকিমা যা ই খেতে চায় না কেন, কাকুকে  কোনোদিন বাজারে যেতে হয় না। 😁😁😁
Lol she didn’t say plz on the Vietnamese pork lol
No CLAWS or KNUCKLES?!? 😭 That’s all I want in my roll please (when you make me one)
Poor man cook for evil woman’s hard life
He's sulking 🤣
I just wish I could be that decisive on the daily
I want to do this one day for my wife when I fund one
He did prepare that with anger
Phe girls do nothing in this videos...
Plural of sister-in-law is “sisters-in-law”. Like “attorneys general” or “courts martial”
It was nice sister in law showed some manners in this video. Babe always says thank you.
The look babe gave sister cracked me up when she said lobster rolls. 😂
I'm baffled she knows what she wants.. If I had a chef partner I would just call everyday the chefs special cause I know whatever it is it will be divine.
I'm wondering where did you buy that chopping board?🥲
That did not look like a New England Lobster 🦞 no wonder you’re Sister in Law is disappointed.
We need to clone this guy.
The one time she says please
looooooooooooooool
WOMeN ☕☕
The only time I've heard you speak negatively... "ugh sister-in-laws"
Finally they start to play with how this channel is perceived lol.
Babe looks soo happy in every vid i see!!. What a babe
Wow  mouth watering dish😋😋😋
Is the please after the backlash to her skank friends
Raw?? Crab was raw.
I know the feeling about sister in-laws!!! 🤬
I want 2 turds in the toilet please
First time ive heard your babe say thanl you LMAO
GOD BLESS IN JESUS MIGHTY NAME AMEN 🙏🙌✝️🕊❤️!!!
Very sortudo esse cara!!!! A esposa e a cunhada super gatas.
I usually don't understand what she is asking for?
Finally wife’s guests learn to say thank you and please lol 😂 looks great chef 👨‍🍳
Bro you are so cool!!
Yeah put her in her place
I'm starting to wonder if she can cook herself haha
You one cool brother in law Did she just complain about something??  Lucky your babe is a delight
beta male qualitys
Interesting to note that those lobsters don’t have any front claws, like ours do in the Northern hemisphere.
THANK YOU
See you next Tuesday
This in law needs to be shown how to ne more respect then sje is now or needs to eat at home and not always depending on her sister or her husband What a disrespectful person. No MATTERS.
PLEASE… after hearing this Andy be: now I can die in peace
Lucky sister in law.
dude i actually feel sad for you even this is scripted
He didn’t cook the lobster?
That looks so good
Spoiled little brats!! The lot of you , except the beloved chef ofc
Ouch
Rude sister in law the ones last year were bigger how’s about a little gratitude, his wife on the other hand please and thank-you I’d cook for someone like her anytime because he is doing a fine job looking after her. Her sister would say she was only joking but something tells me she was genuinely disappointed to be made lobster rolls. Make it yourself next time sister pfff good day
I want some too....please
Is the lobster raw?
Girl, you ain't even cute enough to be acting like a queen! Sorry, someone had to finally say it!
They look awesome
So ironic how ever recipe she wants he has the ingredients for! 🤣🤣
I love watching you guys cook for each other. So cute
Did he not cook the lobster?🙄 Or was it already cooked????
Raw lobster? Why?
now that’s a quality ass nigga. don’t lose him, ya bimbos.
Can you cook for me?
Your a good man I would have given the sister the old i only married one of you
At last please and thank you
Congratulations man, fantastic skills and amazing recipes, greetings from Italy!
Chef could you make Dutch cuisine nicer? 👨‍🍳
Aids rolls tbh
She shouldn’t be the one correcting her for saying please she never says please!
He is owsome
Бедный мужик
You're sister in law insists on you getting respect and she's the problem?
As someone who went into debt due to a crippling lobster roll addiction, my time has come..
i felt that sigh of saying sister-in-laws on a spiritual level 😂
Why does he put the green onion in ice water ?
The greatest mistake is overcook the seafood... that’s way overcooked so covered with sauce and spices... that is another big mistake 👎
Mhmm mayo.. wtf is this wanna be roll
Wow!!! That was a real lobster!! Amazing!!!😍
Why such a long face??
They want some of your heroin
how do they always know what to eat
He didn't cooked the lobster
The wife doesn't even say please usually bloody hell
“well inflation has gone up since Christmas”
The fact that she had to tell her to say please your not a child a little kindness and courtesy goes a long way which is probably why he said that.
If you can give me a recipe for the food that is being cooked, please tell me the names of the ingredients, what are the spices.  so we can try to cook it.  thanks
I went on a dive today and saw a couple lobsters... Thanks. Now i know how they got used...
Its not even cooked
Omg you have 2 frenchies and 2 staffies. I'm so jealous.
Andy, just be thankful you can throw her ass out. Also there's a reason she not married.
"Sister in laws" literally sounded like the meme   "WOMEN" 😂😂
Alr yeah but why does he just have a lobster
Just a hint of this and a sprig of that...hours later ...
This is hard to be okay with damn white people
Tbh sis wouldn’t have got shit
If u ever get confused just fuck the dad, works every time
This dudes the maddest Simp on the Internet.
damm
Why are the sisters always hotter?🤔
Cookbook from day one  Keep them coming 👍🏽
Show more of the dogs😂🤙🏽
💯.....
Women should cook not the man
Alexander MCQUEEN lookalike
And then of course she whines after you make it all! What the hell man don’t let her treat ya like that! The fact that you make all the food is cool, but then bitching makes it worse
Yo you must make her say please, it’s so rude that she just demands instead of asks
🤣🤣🤣sister inlaws🤣🤣
Click don't recommend channel, after three shorts" u watch again, yes"
"Sister-in-laws"... ROFL
I'm convinced that fridge is actually a portal to a store where the clerk just hands him anything he needs lol
Good to see the ungratefulness runs in the family
You had me at Lobster Roll 🦞🦞 🦞
She made sure her man was shown respect
Post shorts for at least a week where you wife cooks for you for straight 7 days 😜🙂
A proper please and thank you changes everything don't it 🤌🏼❤️
I love to watch  its great
She probably likes to visit all the time 😂😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This one was a little funny
If you got lobster just sitting around you might as well cook it!!😂😂
...because at Cristmas, you were smaller.
Luckiest guy in the world! Just happened to have some cooked lobster ready to go.
Is this like the only time anyone said please or thank you? Or maybe I haven't seen too many of these videos or I've seen too many where they don't say please or thank you?
You will not happy at all
Him: *In mortyifying groans*   "Sisters in law"
A big sigh followed by "Sister-in-law's."  🤣🤣🤣
Finally a please now let's work on the thank yous
You look like Tony hawk if he was a chef
Maine lobster is the only lobster too eat !!!
Yeah lemme j grab the lobster from my fridge…
In germany we say ja moin gar kein bock
🤣🤣
Are you even married? How is it your sister in law?
Damn they actually 😳 look delicious....
Are they twins!
"Sister in-laws ☕"  -🗿
😮
You make the women in your life seem spoiled and ungrateful loo
Aha u guys r hilarious and are the best!!
Gala buffet night had me having lobster pizza twice a weeeeek 🤭😋🤤
Stand up for your man
I’m glad she made her sister say plz cause her friends in the other one were rude.. the one treated him like he was a server and he interrupted her convo and the other one completely ignored him
"I want lobster rolls" Well you know where the kitchen is make it your damn self
I initially thought he was gonna say “Hey Babes what do you want for lunch”
Is your fridge just like a portal to your nearest Costco? You have literally everything a chef needs in there!
All the people insisting on the please last time lmao
Hey!  They said Thank You... now no fake grousing. 😄
How they eat without cooking nonveg
I can’t stand how rude these people are. The lady and her friends and all her people
Miam 😋 des guedilles comme en Gaspésie, Québec, Canada
I love meatloaf. Have you ever had a meatloaf sandwich? It is the greatest thing that has ever happened to my taste buds.
Cute
A Blessing from God True Love  ❤
Oh they finally said please and thank you.
Best and easiest way to cook fries pls (5)
🤢 raw fuck naw gotta cook them first
Those aren't lobsters!! Come to Maine if you want lobsters 🦞!!
And she was smaller at Xmas.lol
Chips not required
Looks like he cooked up some manners and they finally ate it all up
Is time they make something for you 🙄
Nice recipes can we can the names of sauces,spices you use
Sooooo cute. Hahhahah I love the bangin there.
Frozen lobster.... gross
BUSSin !
That’s actually an easier one lol.
Whats the proper name of this scraper looking thingy?
Kkkkkkkkkkk
“I want lobster roles please.” “Uhh, no. What about something normal? A sandwich perhaps?”
Funny she says to her sister to say please. Don't think I hear it out of her mouth. Do as I say not as I do eh
That was cool kiritsuke too
Love how she was like nah, not this time. You say please and you say thank you
i wanna be his babe wth so good 😂👑
True story: Wife: would you like some spaghetti? Me: yes Wife: there's the pot (pointing to empty pot so I can cook it for her)
🙂🤗🥰👏😋🤤!!!!!!
bro how he have everything in his kitchen
She never says plz lol
But she said rolls...these werent twisted somehow...
I want your fridge.
So Beta
Sister in law didn’t even say thank you, I’d kick her in the pool
PLEASE! THANK YOU!
I mean damn. I know the set up is to showcase you cooking and for the show etc etc. the way they say please and thank you sounds rude. Is it the accent or maybe it’s me. Your a hell of a chef. Seeing a video of your wife kissing you or saying your the best or genuinely thanking you beyond the bland “thank you” would means a lot. Just my impression
😋😋😋😋
What's wrong with lobster rolls ?
Do u ever get a break from makeing food or do you enjoy making it for others
*sisters-in-law... 🤣 just messing with you. Thanks for the great content
No thank you from sister in law. So not wright!!!!
I’m sorry it doesn’t look like lunchtime out there anymore
God yessssss
Блин,ну точно это актёр из порнухи!!! Вспомнил его!!! Он их перед трахом походу подкармливает!!!😂
They really have no idea do they?
Please be patient speaking from experience brother-in-law‘s can make your marriage miserable thank you for doing what you do
Your amazing chief 👌♥️🇱🇧♥️
Andy has heard Babe ask for every type of cuisine from all over the globe and never batted an eye. That's true love. But Sister in Laws just come over when they're hungry.  Lol
Well it's not Christmas is it
that man can cook everything
The lobster just happens to be living in the magic refrigerator  Coz that's just the way it is in the House of Andy.
Just have a random lobster in the fridge… yep totally
I couldn't understand the last think she had said but it sounded to me like she said "I actually wanted a burrito" 🤣 I was like "you mf" and I didn't even have to cook 🤣
🤣🤣🤣
lober
Yah pretty sure she likes bigger
There's no way you made that in 1 minute!
Did she saaay...🤣🤣🤣
Noooo you say no your getting to fat how bout a salad
If they were bigger on Christmas THEN WAIT UNTIL CHRISTMAS AND CHRISTMAS YO WAY OUT MY HOUSE 😒
I would tell that sister in law to go to hell so fast she would lose her appetite forever.
i cnt be only one thinkin🤔😁🤣
Ugh your sister in law sucks   i hope it was staged because if she is really this shitty . mate stand your ground. That was such bad behavior for someone working hard for someone elses satisfaction.
Sister is ungrateful asf like girl you in they house talm bout bigger eat your food and enjoy this is not a restaurant
I wanna make this. Recipe?
"Sister in laws" 🤣🤣🤣
Sister in law wasn't too impressed in the end
The thank you still didn't come from the sister 😩
Bro gimme like fifteen pounds of pure gold for lunch please me hungie
Bro can I just come hang out for a couple days? I'll bring some bud so we can all have the munchies!
I don’t understand the criticism he always asks her what she wants and she always says “thanks babe” in every video of theirs ive seen yall are tripping
What did you do with the rest of the lobster🫣😁
I just asked my wife to at least ask me. All orders.🤔
You are awesome
Why you look like the dude from 101 Dalmatians
زن ذلیلِ خواهر زن ذلیل بیچاره بدبخت
She's pretty
Is the lobster cooked ?
Man I'm just curious. What do you do besides cooking to your babe??? You're cool cook!
CAN I BE Y'ALL"S HOMEGIRL?
Celery? Nooo..
That looks good never tried that
I know its a skit but its so funny seeing the look on the sisters face like "Took you long enough you bum"
“U got lobster roll money?”
My brother in law is a scumbag... I'm so jealous 😂
Dude just has a whole lobster chilling in the fridge
I’ve never understood why hot dog buns are used to make lobster rolls. There’s way better choices at the bakery.
i know they’re jokes but like.. ew. be nice to him
I traumatized
They look like sisters 💀
Sir, That's a crayfish.
Oh no bro uses praise mayonnaise why bro whyyy 😭
Your patience with your wife is amazing 🤩
The down side of being able to cook like a boss. Ppl other than your Wife & kids always ask u to cook them something. I feel your pain.  I gave up and just taught them their fav recipes one year.
These videos are awesome!!!!
Looks delicious.
He’s the Best !
Damn she married you only for food ngl
The claws are much better for this
Hated family member I see
Mmm looks delicious!
Very good wife putting her sister in place
He is the best!!!! You gotta love ❤️ love love ❤️ this guy!!!!! First wife and now sister-in-law, wow!!!!!
Do the recipe !!!
What she said at the end should’ve got her kicked out the house
I love how she made her say plz 😂👏🏾
This is B.S.  No women knows what she wants to eat.
Haha sister in laws 😆 🤣
This video title makes me cringe so much, I have no idea why.
I thought they meant sushi😱
Maybe use a Lobster then and not a langoustine because its a different animal
“More lemon” 🤣🤣🤣 had me dying lmfao
Too good master chef..
Lmao she corrects her saying please but i ain't heard the gf say please a say in her life
Haha! She never says please, herself.
I feel like his fridge is magical like Hermione's bag: essentially everything is in there, ready to go.
Sister is so beautiful and sweet 😍
Wife never cooks?
You know life is good when u have lobster sitting in your fridge lol.
Sister in laws
Your sister in law is about 15lbs from being able to complain about portion sizes🤣
He said babe lady god
I bet bro even has a coconut tree inside that fridge
Atleast 1 person said thank you in tbis video. Almost refreshing
Mate for any success in future, know that you deserve it which you are the most human and good person in knew in social media.. Australia is the home of a good human been 🌸🌸
Can we get a behind the scenes video of you making the videos?
I love how she's like "please 🙄" but she never says please
I love how he's wicked annoyed when it's any other woman asking besides his wife
SIMP
What a guy. Don't break him.
need a Maine Lobster...that looked chewy asf
She's like, I wanted a hot buttered one
At least the sister in law said please and thank you, the girl friends barely acknowledged the feast you laid out for them including but not limited to, A Sicilian pizza, a bunch of other foods I can’t remember the name of
Tom yum soup for Sophie
That was so sweet to make them lunch. Exactly what they wanted.
No way she just told her sister to say please when she barely say thank you
Andy I feel the same way
Good you didn't boiled it alive
Well done, mate. 👏👏👏👏👏 I always teach my wife to cook. So she will be fine when I am gone. Her grilling is getting better. Just today, she asked me if mushrooms and onions good ob pork. A package she bought. I said, 'that is more for beef ". We know what goes together well. Mushroom sauce on pork chops? Fecking never. Cheese sauce on duck or salmon? Never. There are just things that suck together.
First woman to say please to him *sighs in disappointment*
When your babe want some wild boar or wild meat??:-)
Amazing video. Do you have a recipe for this?👌👍👏🤤
What's the knife using here?
Real Men cook for their Babe.
Lunch = Lakh
Do you have a brother?
Too funny and looks amazing
You’re such an Loving and Wonderful Husband and Chef  Excellent just Excellent and Delicious 😋
This chef has SKILLZ! Plus the Presentation is Key. PEACE
He murdered larry
Nice you care for her family member #3!!!
oof 😅
I know that's right. Teach her to say, please 🙏🏾
He is one in a million ...lucky wife ...he has excellent cooking skills 👌
Looks Good!!!
Why is the comment section obsessed with ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ 🫤. Its a YouTube video and it’s cool as it is. Also why do so many people think he just has these ingredients on hand as if he doesn’t plan the videos before filming? I wonder if they also think the camera just happens to be on and catches him cooking candidly and also edits and uploads too.
Glad that lobster was already coocked.  So cruel to boil them alive 😢
Ah yes. I too have a cooked lobster on hand whenever I need.
I am 48, you got a brother. I be your sister law.
This man is an ANGEL in human form! ❤❤❤
I didn’t ask you I asked my wife
"Sister-in-laws"... Yep, I got the of em.
The way he cut those chives was extra pissy this time
Did the background sound was ”talking to the moon "
😂😂😂
Funny how she asked for her friend to say please when I've never heard say it. But it's a good start.
I like that you showed that you tasted it and added more lemon, just a small thing but it shows the craft over just a perfect video
He got infuriated after the last video where poor he didn't even get a thank you😂
Classic!
Yess you got a split top roll which is how a lobster roll should be served any other roll is inferior for a lobster roll
Looks great 👍
I'm so impressed by this guy..where can I find someone like him?
Not her talking about please and thank you
Ugh! DELISH!
😂
Troppo veloce.....
Sister in law has good taste =yummy
Yeah sister in laws ....Fuck.emm
Will you marry me, sister wives 🥰🥰🥰🤣🤣🤣. I'm serious 😳.
Dill in a lobsta roll 🤢
NO NO NO. Serve hot on a toasted hotdog bun with butter. That's it, no extra bullshit.
Thank god I had these lobstaaas handehh
😍😍🥰👌🔥🔥🔥😋😋👍🏽👌😋😋🥰🤣
Yumm!! I… never had a lobster roll. I would like to try one though 😁
That "sister-in-law" was not scripted😂
Now she did not say “the ones at Christmas were bigger” bi**h give me my food back
Compliments to Babe for having her husband so well trained
bro just has a whole ass lobster chillin in his fridge
Sister-in-laws 😂😂
Andy keeps fully cooked lobster as a fridge staple!
Please is important. She's looking out for you.
Is it concerning that his sister in law answered when he called babe
I love this couple beautiful gorgeous when you have kids your beautiful wife and you will be the best parents in the 🌎
👍👍❤️❤️
As a New Englander, I’ll give you the props! Those lobster rolls look pretty good!
I believe it would be “sisters in law”
That sister in law wouldn't get ish if she can't learn to say please and thank u! Andy, u rock!!!👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
He said babe what do you want not sister in law what do you want
He won't cook lobster 😣😣😣
She wants Rolls Lobster. 😄
Man slaves..... lol
Is your fridge Doraemon’s pocket or what? 😂
Does she ever do anything. She takes advantage of him.
This man can cook anything
Always be the good brother in law lol
I could eat 2 of those
Is she's sister single?❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just casually having fresh lobster in his fridge, no big deal
I do miss a good lobster roll.
Bro i think your fridge is doraemon's pocket 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hahahaha good job bro 😀💕 sister in law's is a sister in law at least she requesting you 💕
Plot twist: his whole family is cannibal🙂🐴🤮🤮🤮🤮
He didn’t cook the lobster
WHO THE HELL HAS LOBSTERS AT THE HOUSE
With each video he's turning more and more into a butler/ chef lol.
This generation is insane
I think I might’ve gotten through to your wife.  Now she’s even saying please AND thank you.  Nicely done.  And you are an amazing chef…
I adore the channel! Lol when are you going to do shrimp and grits? Lol💜💜
No sé si esto es entretenido o el es su esclavo mie tras ella es una empresaria y el tipo amo de casa:v
You should work with chef Ramsey
He definitely gave her a bigger roll at Christmas 😉.
Good thing you love cooking buddy!
Knife name pls
As a sister in law, I can guarantee you that we do always request lobster rolls for lunch to our sisters' husbands👍
Hate her
I thought it was really funny when she had to remind her own sister to say please🤣
Haha love your sister-in-law!!
I love Crayfish!!
மச்சினிச்சி வந்திருக்காங்கன்னு சொல்லுங்க மச்சான்..
Chickin teriyaki?
damm that looks good
My sister talks like that… this last New Years I made a porterhouse, ribeye, shrimp and veggie tempura + a mushroom sauce and she said “that’s not New Years food”.
I hope he got sum
So lobster, green onion/scallion, celery, mayo, lemon.  Was there another green in there? Was that fresh dill?And what was the seasoning you used? Want to try it. Thanks!
He made that looks totally easy it look good I don't even eat that kind of food
Man dishes look better than Gordon's dishes
Dude your attitude is so different whenever you go to the house versus when you’re at work it’s so funny😂😂
Why do I feel aggression in this vid haha 😂
Cannabis family
They said Please 👍
This cracked me up! 😂
Do u make these meals daily or just for vids? And do u ever get fast food?
Can I be your cameraman for a week? I promise not to eat the food, I just want to smell it.
His voice give me narrator vibes 😂
They look Incredibly ungrateful
Love this guy ,  I would like him to be a well known visitor to my man cave... When I acquire a man cave.
why does sis in law respond to "hey babe" ??? 😂😂😂🤣
Hi. Hello. I would really enjoy a piece of warm blueberry pie with a gob of homemade vanilla bean ice cream on top. It’s Lori. 🫐👍🏻
Just like a little sister, got bust his chops at the end. LOL.
I see why they don't have a man
Damn, she couldn’t just be great ful?
Lobster Rolls without MAYO or Ranch plz
When I stumbled across this channel i thought "cool a guy cooking, lets stay & watch" now I'm just noticing this a cook cashing in on how much ppl love bashing women. I'm not surprised but a bit disappointed
Not Larry the lobster! Noooooooooo
You can hear the pain in his voice when he says sister in laws 🤣
Lobster roll 😐 exhales Sister in law’s  POV your him
Bruh😂😐✋👋🤭😶
He looks like the "NOICE"  GUY
Dumplings for me lelin rai
Don’t worry bro.  Both will be humbled by the famine that is incoming soon.
When you say "Hey, Babe" but the sister in law answers first 😎
You should Mabel crab Rangoon
Can you make gumbo
The wife acting like she herself ever says please 😂😂
I wish my husband was a chef lol 😂 he literally cooks once every 5 years lmao 🤣
Me: Rip that lobster Also me: That lobster roll looks so good
Bro who asks for that at someones house😂
Has to have someone tell her to say please!  Come on now.....
Step bro your lobster is stuck in my roll
Ur great in cooking
Just keep cutting things into neat rectangles. That's enough for me😍😍😍😍
She always knows what she wants
You pissed sister in law?   And in Indian, AKA indian hindu,   people wait when Sister in law will come home,  because they love their sister in laws,  its a Free Sex PARTNER for them bro.
Just stop cooking for a week and see her reaction. She'll appreciate you much more.
Just happens to have a cooked lobster in the fridge.
Is the lobster raw?
At least the said please and thank you 🙂
Always more lemon
Love the celery salt! Have never had the cold lobster roll. I forget whether that one's Maine or Connecticut style, but the one I had was tossed in butter and celery salt, served warm. Served with Cole slaw (seasoned with celery seeds) and Old Bay kettle chips.
Supposed to be hot?
My husband is a professional chef and does this every night for me as well he always asked me what I would like for dinner and always makes what I request I have not cooked in 13 years I am blessed I am grateful I am thankful for my wonderful husband
Did he seriously put celery and onion and shit in the lobster. Ya this is how we know he’s a bad chef lol
Not before long your babe is gonna need much bigger clothes, m8.
What did that ungrateful B say?!
I know it's staged and all... But imagine casually visiting something and then be like "I'd like a 50 dollar hot dog please"
Funny how nobody asked her
Sisters in law, not sister in laws.  But everything else on point.
I want recipes
Plot twist her name is actually babe
So, in front of others, babe says please and thank you  😂😂😂
In NZ we call those crayfish
Do you eat
He not gone cook the lobster
Damm finally I can rest in peace they said please!
The transitions are so clesn
Bruh probably wants to leave his wife after every video

Your wife and sister are so lucky.
Love the staffys and frenchys
Everything you make looks so delicious!

What the hells wrong with the women in these VIDEOS, there so freaking rude!!’ The guys cooking your dinner while you’re drinking wine and sitting on your ass’s!! No flipping MANNERS!!!
Noooo la maionese nooooooo😂😂😂🤦‍♂️👏👏
If you would have made meatloaf, you could have just hacked off a piece,  served it in a sammich and told them lunch is ready!  Instead, you give them options......
I want tour babe for lunch
This man is deserves a beer.
She never says please....her sister had to remind her to say "please"
"What do you want for dinner? " "Instant Noodles please" 🙂🙂🙂🙂
Sister-in-laws ☕
Gosh this is the first time i’ve seen a female can’t cool but instead the male is the one cooking…. That’s very rare encounter.
She finally said please!!
U the man👍
At least she said plz
Just happened to have some cooked lobster in the fridge.
I love how this guy cooks amazing food but i just saw him eat raw meat topped with an egg yolk and potatoes fried crispy
Can I borrow him, great chef!  You're are lucky.
that's some kinda lobster salad mate come to connecticut for a proper buttery lobster roll. if you gotta put more soybean mayo and celery than lobster you ain't doin it right. if you wanna munch on celery dipped in mayo go right ahead but keep that trash outta the lobster roll

I thought it was going to be sushi 🤣
You're welcome 🥺
Sister in laws...
FUN FACT: This guy have a song in all of his videos. You just can hear it.
I like how she always knows what she wants to eat

Those pleases and thanks were so played off the comments I love it. Way to tell everyone to suck it.
She thought it was bigger 🤣🤣🤣🤣
“ Sister in-laws 🙄” I felt that

At least the wife knows what she wants.  Mine never knows what she wants to eat
Youre too good for her

Ungreatful women..
As he has the lobster on demand. And bro bake the roll yourself please then we may gain a little knowledge
The best chef ever.
Chubby sister need to lay off the bread.
Love your videos. Looks so easy
You know, I used to be against the idea of cloning, but...
the hardest part of making a lobster roll is pretty much buying the lobster lol
Looks amazing!!!!!
On 500k I want you to start making shorts in which the back ground song stays till the end
What cooking shows do you compete on sir?
You love it chef!
Nice to see a please and thank you!! Look delicious :)
My babe only wants I Don't Know for lunch or dinner

Who’s who cause wayment .. eh por que no Los dos
Does your wife ever cook for you ??
I wish my hubby was like you.  Mine couldn’t boil water even if he had a video to watch .
So that's a lobster roll.
Can your babe cook for you just once? She is annoying the fuck outta me
If I had whatever food I wanted on demand I'd look like violet after she ate the blueberry in willy Wonka
You are just amazing, even better than Gordon Ramsey!!
Best chef ever can cook everything OM juice
Love it
Your awesome guy love every thing you make videos to 🤦🏻‍♀️ know feeling 😂
WHAAAAAT???!!!!! Please and thank you in the same video??? My head is about to explode 🤯
If I was your sister in law I’d be at your house every weekend soaking up whatever you would teach and or cook 😂
Its the sisters in laws comment that has me dying
Que rico se ve
Hope he ate some not just cooked for the spoiled ones xD
I love your videos by the way, I'm a stay at home dad / Dad of seven
The ones at Christmas was Biigga mate(?)
Idk man I'll just take a bowl of cereal
That looks delish..
I want one now 😋
He back cracked that lobster
Excellent!  Now I know what to do with that steamed lobster sitting in my fridge
I wish I wish though my hubby does cook for me occasionally but I just wish he was more like you
Casually telling your partner that you want lobster rolls. Sorry, but I'm just too broke to serve a woman that kind of luxury
Ok I liked it better when they didn't say thank you nah I'm just joking looks delicious
Just happen to have a lobster in the fridge.. 😅...🦞🦞
Yep, in Russia named “krabovy salad”
MORE LEMON
The sister who complains they're small...  looks like she enjoys larger portions quite often!
*sisters-in-law
Remove her plate right there and then.
Love it !!!! 😋😀 😊
What's really impressive is how this guy fits an entire Super market in his fridge so that he can make any meal at a moment's notice
They said please this time! Finally learning manners 😂
That looks so delicious!!! Everything you cook looks so dang delicious!!!
Im starting to think his wife has a boyfriend.
Wait so we don't fry the lobster??
Satisfying cut
As long as u got them fr my state of  maine lol
You loved it
FINALLY!
I'm in AWE that every time they want something you just so happen to have the ingredients in hand.  Your refrigerator is like Wardrobe to Narnia. Bravo👏🏼👏🏼
Might be acting but why is she so damn rude lmao
I would turn gay if I could meet a man like that 😎
On one million we want babe and sister cooking for you
Damn the fans even got them to say please now. Is that progress or something else?
Why don’t we see your wife cook?
Wow
« Please » there you go its nit that hard
Once again someone that believes they are in title's to his cooking. He ask the wife. Sister inlaw should kept her mouth shut. Don't care it tiko or  YouTube. She need to stay in her lane
Anyone else notice Talking to the Moon playing at the beginning?
Y'all just happened to have lobster in your fridge?
Hey babe, what do you want for lu..... oh wait, I'm single and happy as a mfer.
Omg this guy is so awesome so happy the sister-in-law said please
your wife needs to doing that.  grow a pair
I love how he says hey BABE what do YOU want for lunch and her sister answered. 🥴🥴🥴 I’m sorry but are you his babe? If not, then he wasn’t talking to you tf 😂😂
My question is how the fuck they always know what they want I struggle to figure out what i want for breakfast lunch and dinner
Horse with a z
Horse
RIP LARRY
Lol those two came a long way from meat pies and sausage rolls from the servo…
WOW PLEASE AND THANK YOU   GREAT JOB CHEF
lost all respect didn't even use the best part the tamale SMH
Guys they are scripted, don't you find it strange he always has the ingredients for what they ask for? Not saying please or thank you is part of the gag, it's probably what he asks them to do.  I swear there's one brain cell everyone passes around in the comment section.
😅 sister in laws 🤣
Their appreciation is overwhelming!!
Complain instead of being grateful 🤦🏻‍♂️
He looks like he’s enjoying making his wife and sister-in-law happy. I think if you enjoy what you’re doing in life you don’t work a day in it.
Rolls…claws only
WELL IT AIN'T CHRISTMAS IS IT!!
Those lobster chops where for lobsters
I need me one of him my only  Gordon Ramsay
Inlaws are funny people
Master chef 100 percent
I feel like I'm going to end up like this guy, but I wont allow it. I'll cook what I want
“The one’s at Christmas were bigger” hahahahaha 😂😂😂😂
Sister-in-law has good manners ,
Witchhh
A good chef always tastes his dishes. 👍
Wow!!! Im jealous! Having a chef at home is a dream!! 😍
This guy is a magician!
Me: Babe I’m so hungry what do think we should eat? Babe: whatever you feel like cooking  Me: 🤷‍♀️  Still so jelly, but in a good way 😌
She gets mad for not saying please… when she never says it 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
I love sis answerd and not wifey
What was the seasoning?? It went too fast!
I _love_ the sass lol
I love a man that cooks😂
Nice 😊
Lol they said "please" they be looking at the comments
My girlfriend does this to me all the time lol.
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👑👑👑👑👑💝💝💝💝💝👑👑👑👑👑❤❤❤❤❤💚💚💚💚💚🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟💐💐💐💐💐
👍
God I see what you're doing for others 🤣
😲😳
They never say thank u or anything!
Much more polite this time 👍 Though could still use work at the end.
What a man.
My goodness all of his food look so good.
I love your channel because this is my life lol
She made sure she said please lol
I’m willing to bet the sister-in-law is single af lol
I love how we roasted his family in the first few videos for no manners now we get please and thank yous and I couldn't be a happier Canadian
Oh my goodness. I’ll take a brother in law like that!
The cooking in the videos is actually pretty basic. But your wife knows what she wants and that in itself is pretty insane.
*sighs* "sister-in-laws"  Ive never related more to something man
Luckily you had lobster in your fridge...
Mf making a fancy lobster meal while im eating half a pack of ritz crackers for lunch
On every video he has...the music  always stop abruptly
Sister in laws??
Im new to this channel and already excited i heard a please and thank you in the same video. !
He is true sexy man
If he was my husband I'll be afraid to cook anything for him even making cereal 😂
Man, you can come to my house & cook for me. I like his style.
Cool video. He's a Good Cook. I never had a lobster roll yet?
Todo homem tem que saber cozinhar pra servir a amada😉😉😉
Just happened to have a fully cooked lobster in the fridge?
Seems like a restaurant instead of home😄😄
You’re a Champ
You Are a gr8 cook !
She said Thank You!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Imagine having to teach an adult please and fucking thank you smh like how?!
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🌞
I really don't understand this bit where he's always annoyed at the requests, why not just cook the food, is there a point being made here?
Wow the sister actually said please unlike the wife
Any chance of getting the recipes in the descriptions? Lmao I want to make this so bad. Amazing videos!!
Only makes lobster rolls in videos
You were fine until the celery.
Much mo polite
He always walks into these, doesn’t he? When will he learn?
Not better than nick di giavoni lobster rolls
I love this guy .... I wish I can cook like him ....
When she gonna cook or do something
Really? Why sister in law just looks at it without saying thank you and just hates it cuz they smaller xD
I need a chef like this id love to not cook for once...love u content
I’d make them 2 minute noodles.
Y’all sound like Bluey
Ummmm, where can I find a man like him? Apparently he's the only one of his kind. Luck lady indeed!!!
I get it, the entitlement and lack of appreciation is the “style element” of these shorts but it crushes my food loving, Italian heart. I am the primary chef in my household and my partners grateful reaction is a part of what makes serving dinner so special to me, he has recently taken up cooking and he is wonderful at it, and I can never tell him enough how much I appreciate him.
OMG ...DID I HEAR PLZ WOW RIGHT THAT ON THE CALANDER AND I HEARD A THANK U OMG WTF
So Jealous over here Everything looks so delicious name your ingredients please
I do saw what you did there in between 😂
Tell me your a good cook without telling me your a good cook. This guy:
Can u gals... please say thank you to him .....i really dont like that u all being so busy...while he so kind to serve u all the food..., Any way sister in law was said thank you on this video...im appreciates it..💖💖💞💞
Only took him 2 hours.
"more lemon"
I know it's staged but when someone is that disrespectful and unappreciated I just want to slap the $h!+ out of her!
Sister-in-laws 😂😂
Can’t stand one entitled Karen. Will not watch 2 entitled Karens. I’m out.
You see, she said please and thank you 😀
I want a husband that can cook like that
Thanks you ladies for saying please. Represent .
What a guy!
Always happens to have just what he needs🤣
Just found your family today you are all so wonderful, and the cooking is amazing
Brilliant 👏
He’s freaking awesome 👏
I looove lobster🦞
I would be like!!! You cook it you eat it or you go hungry
LMAO I'd tell her to go order some then. Plus allergic to seafood 😭 can never know what it'll taste like
Gotta throw in the old bay brudda
Dude! You’re amazing!! 🏆
Now without the attitude
He didn't make the mayo from scratch
Who are you?  You're amazing!  ❤️❤️❤️
My man just has a precooked lobster in his fridge from the previous night cause why not.
Id tell her to make her own shit 🤣
Make you wish you didn't ask🤣🤣
He just happened to have a lobster in the fridge... some people are so fortunate👍
Please and Thank you. Finally. Lobster roll looked delicious.
👏🏾 good job on using your manners ladies!
White privileged……
Where do you find these men? And I’m not asking for a friend lol
"The ones for Xmas were bigger" Inlaws will be Inlaws 🤷🏾‍♂️😂
Must be nice to have rich-people Problems.
He just happened to have a lobster already cooked in the fridge, lol !
Andy is "The Man" and now I like them again for saying Thank You to him👍
Love it!!! Your cooking skills are amazing! Keep the videos/shorts coming 👍
One lobster shy, thats why they had to be small
Fresh lobster from the ocean
"Cuñadas" jeje
Oiga usted en las mano cocinando es tremendo cocinero felicidades 💯👑💯👑💯👑💯👑💯👑💯👑💯👑💯💢💥💫⚡💝💖💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💯👑
Aw now she wanna make someone say plz
Your a good boy
Finally someone said thank you
awesome...
U call that a lobster 🦞lol
I'd love a boyfriend like him. I'd even marry him.  Lucky girl.
It always seems like they are ungrateful and expect him to just do anything.
Can we just appreciate him test taste his food 🤌🏾😩
Damn I'm jealous
He makes it look sooooo effortless. I want a BIL like him😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Looks Delicious 😊❤
I want to be your babe🤣🤣
LMAO!!!  What will Everyone bitch about now?
Ewwww never seen a lobster spilt all the way down the middle like that all the green and nasty parts around the head 🤮
I know it is meant as a joke, but the misogynie on this channel is too much. You can also just cook, make a joke, without pretending women are ‘always annoying’
Bro you have the sharpest sounding videos. Everything literally sounds so fresh
I want to be that sister in-law. I promise to be grateful.😍
Well, good thing we all keep whole leftover cooked lobster in our fridge to make leftover lobster rolls with ... Seriously, franks and beans are more work considered you had the ingredients ready.
just wait till the mother-in-law comes 🤣🤣🤣
There’s a Red Lobster 20 minutes away good luck
Wooow superb  I love u r food video s brooo plzzzzz reply mere plzzz
Sister in law is the one who is saying, "Thank You" and letting Babe know she should also. Looks really good guy, again!! 🤗☺️😊🤩
The lack of please n thank u was in order to show that she is spoiled I think It was supposed to be funny I think But u judged them instead. Thats a shame ...
Ruining the lobster
I wish to have to have a brother like him 😌
As a New Englander, I am particularly pleased with the bun.
Too many ingredients Mate Lobster needs no onions..
She finally learned how to say thank u
Wow!.... make me lobster roll, you'll get more then a please and thank you! 😊
Food looks amazing.. your babe is a very lucky woman.. she has her own personal chef at hand whenever she's craving anything..
Far from Maine lobster
What? He didn’t bake the bread? Disappointed 💩
The need for “thank you” & “please” has been heard!!
One of the trillion things I miss living in Massachusetts there lobster Rolls And their lobster pies  This looks so delicious😋.
"More Lemon."
Finally the please and thank you
I think those ladies are  just pulling a fast one on you because they know you always cook for your wife so whatever they request, you are going to cook it for them
The ones at Christmas were bigger!!!!! Are you serious!!!! This guy slave’s away to make what ever the hell you want and dose a great job at it mind you. and you have the nerve to complain.😤😤😤😤😤
This is legendary a he finally got a please and thank you! Gratitude goes a far way! Amazing! 💯
If someone came to my house and said. “I want lobster” and punch them in the mouth
I hate celery so much....I was crying cause everything else looked so 😍 but...celery😣
Amazing man he's a keepers blessed woman...
Amazing!!!
Must be nice. I came from a generation that didn't have what you want but what we have...and you will enjoy it!!
Say “thank you” to these mad skills. ALWAYS!!! Sheesh. Super unappreciated.
Lolz plz
I really do admire the Master Chef and the excellent food ---- but I appreciate even more the sincere "Please!" and "Thank you!"!!!
Chopped Lobster, Chopped Spring Onion, Chopped Celery, (White pepper?) Tartar Sauce, Lemon juice...What's was that Seasoning he Sprinkled on the Lobster? 👍😋
Glad she's saying please
White ppl!!! Smh lol
She want bigger she ain't got to eat nothing! Lol cuz what I see is yummy! 👍😁
Бэйбиз?!! Лобсер ролл вас не удивляет??! Нет восторга?! Опять(
Ugh these people want lobsters that are in fridge.
Crack open the underwater insects that smell like hot garbage
More lemon 🍋
They better keep that same energy
A thank you!!! Wow
What about what the chef himself  wants to eat?! Can she at least be a sous chef 👩‍🍳 ..
The best!
Lol sister in-law is high maintenance 😂
Would you consider adopting a 24 year old grown man
He's amazing! 💕
You have spoiled the women in your family. ♥️
there is an alarmingly large amount of people who get mad at her for not saying please and thank you,,, what,
Much better  ... finally please and thank you  ... nice one
Love it when a man can cook❤❤
I love how quickly she corrected her.
I want to go down under
I want this guy as a BIL!
Sinster in law should cook for you too
I should've married a Chef 😭
I like the dish,  not the skit.
Awesome .ph
Who has cooked,  chilled, ready to go lobster at the ready?  They looked really really good though.  Yum 😋
Brilliance of a perfectionist culinary master
You’re amazing! The shoes are flipped in my house
Ouch I absolutely feel your pain in this video towards the whole situation at hand
Baaaa👏👏👏👏👏
Looks more like an onion roll
Exactly screw that
Ok I'm coming over 🦞🥲
I guess if she said chicken, he'd have to go to the store since every video he always has what they want to eat just waiting on the fridge to be cooked/made. Say burgers next time, or shrimp scampi
Dang that looks good
Someone is learning manners ! Sending love ❤️🐾❤️
Yummy 😋
Dude! Recipes! Maybe a book of them? C'mon.
Okay where did you find this man please clone some more of him
Honestly guys.  Have you ever asked a woman what they want to eat and they actually knew the answer to the question? Totally unrealistic.
What Did your baby do, actually?
She said thank you!!! Yayyyy!!
Talk about spoiled rich it can happen to adaults to
I would have said I said babe what you want for lunch not hey sis what you want for lunch
I thought that was yo wife
That is the sister
I’m not going to lie but my favorite part is when he fingers something….🤷
Well don't look too excited babe
Shitttttt at least they said please and thank you🤣🤣🤣 looks like they been working on their manners
Too many cuts, its making me dizzy
The best lobster rolls that you cooked here looks so delicious and amazing..everyone has to take a taste of it.And the way you prepare your dishes..looks so easy to prepare. It's simply inspiring !
Wow! Manners! And appreciation!
They look delicious never had one
babe’s sister😂 its cute how u call them that
He knows how to cook cook!!
Hit like only cuz they said please and thank you
This guy is amazing! He knows how to cook!
❤️
His reaction sister-in-laws😆😆😆anta
I was infused who the "wife" is smh
Outstanding!
The great conquest of finding the missing 'THANK YOU' comes to an end....
I'm waiting for the girls to randomly ask for geoduck and abalone.
At least she appears somewhat grateful, I was disturbed at how nice you were for cooking and never getting any appreciation. Perhaps stop giving her your credit card and make her cook for herself. Real women do real things and don't look for someone to do it for them EVERY single time. ☝🏼🤷🏻‍♀️
What do you want for lunch? Burger King 👑
Your a great man💪🏼
What a privilege wife,your husband always cook for you.🧐
This makes me so happy ❤️
Hi friend everytime i watch your video it reminds me my ex he he.
I don’t get the formatting of very clearly staged behavior that is supposed to be agitating? Why does a satisfying cooking video need a bad guy?
YeH let me get my leftover lobster out from the fridge…says no one
Wasted meat in the legs
Don't eat water bugs. Get fxct.
Women...
I think I'm in love.
Did this man just put mayo in a lobster roll? Somone take this mans knives away from him pronto!
Dude this guy's is great . YOU GO GIRL AND SISTER TOO
Does babe ever cook?😳
You the man bro 👍❤️ Love it
Yasss she said thank you 1ST... she learn. Good job..
LARRY NOOOOO
Do the women ever cook ?
Not his babe saying please to her sister when she barely says thank you to her babe.
Buy her a strap-on too cuk
As a chef i cried
At least they gave you a "please" and "thank you" this time.  You're an amazing brother in law!
I keep forgetting to look up a fish pie recipe. What a peculiar dish.
Wow she said pls
Best Husband ever.
She said thank youuu 😆
🤢🤮. How do you all eat lobster!  Im a meat eater but not seafood
Orini pasugala ne pellaniki nuvu vandi pettaedhi chusi na Pellam nannu aduguthundi ra jeevtham motham ne pellaniki cook chesukunta undu
Ungrateful
In-laws can be a piece of work, ….
You should Start charging babe
There it is!
This gentleman's wife and her entire family seem self-entitled and having a genuine and profound problem with simple gratitude.
Suppose you only had leftovers pull them all out make something totally different
Ohhh great, the couch potatoes brought families this time!
The food looks amazing, but I'm just happy I finally heard a "Thank you"...
Gado
I want lobster rolls too! Yummy
At least they knew what they wanted, can’t ask anyone what they want and they give me a direct answer
You guys are stuck on them saying Thank you, I’m stuck wondering how that fridge has every ingredient known to humanity in it
Sister in law needs more personal trainer and less lobster rolls 😋
Those looks super delish!
She's lucky
That's man who knows how to take care of two beautiful women         You are the man.
Sisters-in-law, but that’s ok.
That food looks amazing
But honestly funny they finally say thank you but then hit him with the one from Christmas were bigger lol 😂 got ‘em!!
I love to cook and I just wish I could do the things this man does he inspires me to actually get up and learn more so I can be like him or better, truly inspiring for me .
#simp
This guy is amazing! This is every woman's dream 🤣🤣
Are you a chef?
Is anyone going to ignore the fact when he fingers the grass in the bowel?🤣
Awesome filming!
😂😂😂
Don’t do it she won’t say thank you
Robster lolls
Ain't feeling the ingratitude.😥
Is it just me or was he angry cooking today
Sigh! Wish I was your sister in law...
"The ones at Christmas were bigger" got me in a whole laughing fit 🤣
Your sister following your lead. Haha. If ya catch my drift. 😄 Smh.
Not even showing what he is using for some ingredients. He's not trying to be informational. Just making cheesy videos when making a meal. Dumb.
Who wants Lobster rolls for lunch?
I love your videos, but you could used more seasoning.  Layering spices, herbs, garlic onion...is key for FLAVOR
*sister-Inlaws*  Lol ❤️  😆.  That look delicious!
I wish I had a lobster 🦞 in my fridge
I let them make their own food because their adults and can do their own decision making if you want lobster rolls make them yourself if not don't make em or go buy em but they won't be good. Just get good at cooking
Roll?? Look like you stuff a lobster salad inside piece of bread. Am i correct?
A good looking man and knows how to cook
😊👍
Very healthy food to eat...
Does he ever put the ingredients and measurements anywhere?
What a man of my dream, if only the was vegan 💖🌷🌿
Camera man used hes invisible option🤣
Blessed SISTERS!!! 🌸🍃
What do you want for lunch? Lobster rolls and make it faster i don't got all day
Which one is the sister in law and his babe. The title says his sister in law wanted lobster rolls. In the video he asked his babe what she wanted for lunch. She didn’t say please. Then the guy said sister in laws to the person who didn’t say please. This is so confusing
Oh le massacre, tu pourrais au moins faire ta mayonaise toi même
Finally we get a please
It's the sister in laws under his breath that got me 😁🤣😂😂😂
Yes, PLEASE
Aye yo why my lobster rolls come out little like prawns on a stick
That's not an actual real lobster... it's a langusta, or called a rock lobster. It is more closely related to a crawfish or crayfish than an actual lobster.
I love your vids/shorts. Keep it up
Do you ever just not have the ingredients
All that seasoning and still looks bland af
Enough keeps whole cooked lobster in the fridge?
Woman married a Sheff magnificent career move 👏
You heard her… She wants it bigger. Don’t we all.     Sickko’s.
I just had to subscribe after this video, mate!😎🤝
Lol my husband don’t even know what’s in the refrigerator🤦🏾‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️My fault
Can I be a distant friend at least once a year and bring all the supplies everything you need
This some rich people shit
Watch it sister in law!  We all waiting to take your place at the table!😋
Got to be a chef
🤣
Holy smokes folks they said please for once,oh whoa whoa wait!!! And a thank you. These ladies have done their good deeds for the month
His cooking is great but the lobster looked dry when he cut it....
Please...Thank you.
Essa mulher tirou na mega sena😉😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Lemon ruins fish in my opinion. I’ve never used lemon with lobster.
Any chance we could get a recipe mate. Wife wants some of these
Hey babe what you want for lunch ohhh I want gold wrapped silver wrapped in expensive please
O home atual. Um verdadeiro babaca.
Babe's hubby is a gem 💎 to keep😁👍🏼🪅💕
I want him!!!!
Finally a thank you! And a please! Compliments to the chef.
Teach me tour secrets for handling both things
He said Babe, not S-I-L
We’re those raw lobster?
Does he have any brothers,friends... just like him?!👍😅🤣😂OMG! To have a guy like him making nme anything I want every day! That would be heaven!👍
That right!, say please and thank you!
Glad please & thank you was used in this video for your work
Thank you thank you thank you for saying thank you.
My friend, good videos! I love to cook. Although I haven’t been able to do it lately the good values that you show are awesome.  Being polite and loving your wife is key.  Just watch out to become a leftists target. Yup the ones who wants to alter Gods will for a man and woman.  Hooray loving husbands. Lets show how much we love our wives.
Three women in this video
Andy the carpet. At the foot Andy., 😁
Gotta be bangin both sisters no way her man doesn’t care of her enough to where she’s looking for a man in her sister’s man
1 in a million coincidence.males cook for females
Every time he cooks she like don't give a f**k.. this guy cooking skills is good
I just hoping he has a single brother like him...for me.
I can't wait until one day neither BITCH is hungry for lobster for lunch and he makes 10 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and goes out and feeds the homeless.. But I get it that wouldn't show off your cooking skills.
😋
I’d marry this dude to have food like that anytime
Holly fuck she said thank you.
Sing up for master chef you good
I love your skill set... Thank You Hon
Cook it brother 😩😭😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏
Babe doesn’t cook and doesn’t say thank you and you can see , her sister too , what the heck, they need some manners
Where can I order one of you ??
1 million views and we wand and onlyfans account with your wife and sister
Can you be my son or son in law?
No one's talking about how he cut that lobster in half?
I’m glad she made that comment at the end cos I thought those rolls were small too lol
You have the patience of a saint with the most ungrateful guests.
They said please and thank you remarkable👋 lovely dish delicious
The ASMR is real… nice bro
My mouth is watering. 😋 He's so kind and does he have a brother that is as good as he is cooking etc. 😂🤣

You’re welcome in my home anytime
My new love.  Love watching a man cook
Poor bastard!
Bro that shit looks fire
All the things I need please ???
Love it
Beta
The comment section made them say please 😂😂😂 You girls are all right! If you're close to him, you don't have to say please!
You can treat a hoe like this and they still go around  and cheat on you with  a dude who doesn't even have a job.
Jesus loves you just spreading positivity
Gee... You've done this before!!
I'm going to go ahead and drop a like and subscribe because the food looks great, and your wife was at least grateful you cooked for her...yeah, I'll just leave it at that. SIGH!!!
She the one to talk she don’t even say thank u talking about say please🤣🤣💀   Girl Bye ✌🏻
You'r expert in cooking what ever   She wants you prepared.
Hello from Cape Cod MA 🦞🥖 A beautiful lobster roll indeed 😋 I make a wicked good baked lobster mac and cheese 🧀 and also a mean lobster 🦞 bisque . I enjoy your cooking
They really made them put in the "please" after that video of the wife and her friends not giving af about their specially made dishes got abuncha comments about how ungrateful they were 😂😂😂
Wooow
Very sweet of him.
It's because you can cook and you asked 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The ones at Christmas were bigger? Lol the disrespect 🤣
I see we’re saying please now WIN for the comments section
Beta
Im pretty sure that wasn't a lobster
They said please !
😁😁
This counts as redemptions for that other vid where they didn’t say a thing like “ please” or “ thank you”
I hate ungrateful people!!! If she would have said that to me... I would have said " your exactly right,  here,  let me take that for you!" Then I would have eaten right in front of her! Now make your own damn lobster rolls... ungrateful ass!
Yes.... I finally got one thank you
It's always hard for me to imagine having the money, let alone cooking skills to just go "I want some lobster" and doing it.
అయ్ బాబోయ్ కింగ్ లాంటి శీనుగాడు ఇలా అయిపోయాడు ఏంట్రా..... కాలమహిమ
They said please … lol after all the backlash
I love that he has precooked lobsters anytime he needs it.
Please! I wondered why she never seems to help out?🤷‍♀️
Yummy good
Did she say she wanted Doritos?
Looks yummy 🤤
Too say how good this guy thinks he is his food looks average
Relaxing
Love it💯❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
They are way better when it’s just toasted bread, hot buttery lobster and whatever else they include
More Lemon, that's so Alpha.
I need your fridge
Adopt me please... 💕
Hey babe what do you want for lunch? I dunno what do you want?
Sister in law .. 😜
Rich people problems pal
Why not hot lobster rolls?
Forget Gordon Ramsay,this guy is the goat when it comes to cooking 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
No
Aaaaaaaa! Seizure!
Babes sister needs to take her ass to red lobster.
"Hey babe what do u want for lunch"  Him: say lobster rolls for the *video*  Her: for the *video* ? Him: yes for the *video* Her: ok for the *video* * DOESN'T EAT IT *
Love you tattoos man. You look great. 👍
😂
Wish I had some one cooking for me  I'd be more Gratfull then them sisterlaws
Where is the seasoning?
You can replace the lobster with tuna
Makes me smile every time...and makes feel warm and fuzzy......
She's actually using manners this time!
Is not even lobster… but still a good vid
I love the skitz he does for cooking
Using a bench scraper like a bitchhhhhhh
Damn ur good
Some “thank you” would be appropriate, sister-in-law.
I hope them being ungrateful is just a skit
so nobodys gonna talk about that fucking massacre
So wish this was true
“hey babe, what do you want for lunch?”  *cereal*
I love your videos man, great cook.. you guys to need to invite to you'll house so I can eat some of that good food brother.
Like how you pretend your sister in law is a problem when you really wanna show off your your your ...agghhh  show off
Nothin like a man WHO knows how to cook . . . .that is sexy . . .
Im legit so jealous by what he has in his fridge that i want to fight myself
Looks So delicious
You are one lucky woman♥️
Everyone talking about his cooking while I'm surprised by how his wife knows exactly what she wants to eat each time
Maine Girl here. Why do people, including chefs, not remove the fecal strip from the cooked lobster tail before consuming? It's a thin line of waste just under the top layer of flesh.
Wtf I want one of those
Dud
My sister in law lives with us… I felt this on a personal level 😂
Per la fica questo è altro
Yuck
I mean... don't keep lobster in the house. Simple~
I really have NO RESPECT for this guy ....
I bet ur gona be a great wife 1 day
I don't eat lobster shrimp salmon but the way this man be cooking I bet I Ted up he makes it just look like so good oh my God he be having my mouth watering you do your thing man I enjoy watching your videos 💯💯❣️❣️🔥🔥
Lucky. Lucky lucky. Good job fella!🧡🌷
The most amazing thing about these videos isn't the cooking skills, it's the fact that 'Babe' knows what the fuck she wants to eat every time he asks her!
Good man she's very fortunate
The ones at Christmas looked bigger took me tf out🤞🏾😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹🙅🏽‍♀️🧢
Come on man , what ever happened to PB and J sandwich. If it's good enough for kindergarten kids it's good enough for  everyone. I like  a good pb j . Hey try this peanut butter and honey and sliced banana, good stuff.
I need you🙏
For once someone has manners and says plz!!!! If someone cooked like this for me I’d be doing the dishes , giving foot and back massages and 😏… you know!!
You copped a 'thankyou' .. well done and congratulations 👍
I’ve never understood why people seem to love lobster rolls. It’s lobster in a hot dog bun. Then again I do live in New England… I might be spoiled.
What???
Not gonna lie the cutting is satisfying
Isn't this just an everday thing for most people. Cooking for each other. I dont get it. Maybe I should video going for a shit,or scratching my nutsack or picking my toenails. Who'd of thought it eh...ffs
That wasn't a lobster. It was a crayfish.
Man Andy!!! You sure have patience for your  sister law!! With that kind attitude & snobbish. I would of kick her your ass to out of house 🏠 tell her. Go make your own damn lobster 🦞 rolls!!  And especially for not saying thank you!!! lol
I think I'm in love😌
K..so is this fella lookin to adopt?  I mean..I'm 40 😏 but still Lol
When I was dating I would get a Man who could Cook because I can't.    You see I'm the baby girl of the family and never had too do anything but smile 😁😁😁 and watch TV with my  Pop when he was home from the. Steel. Mill
As his head goes down whispering to himself, shit!
You are a great amazing wonderful husband and chef she is blessed to have a husband like you
Id rather my man be a breadwinner ...
Pls be by wife  U cook soo fucking awesome looking  food
There is some kind of awkwardness to this whole set up! I don’t know what it is, but it’s there!
At least they said thank you this time
Hahaha they added the please and thank you because of all the comments that earned a subscribe
“The ones at Christmas were bigger” How about next time you supply the food?! Or better yet, eat before you bring your ass over here and feast on my food?! 🙄
😖😩😩😩😩🥰🥳😤smh
They are doing the Dishes right?
Sister in-laws are the best
Your wife seems decently ungrateful in every video I’ve ever seen shy of this one..I understand it’s mostly just a cooking clip, but still.. it’s kind of sad. How hard is it to say please and thank you on the regular?
Wait!! He just has lobsters in the fridge??
Damn dude. Her sister might wanna try and steal you! Be on the lookout mate!
at this point if a cheftuber doesnt use a bench scraper its subpar content
Hb be smashing
This is how guys commit suicide
For lunch too? Damn
At least if you work in a restaurant  you'd be paid real nice,he's in the wrong for volunteering himself to this. But you got mad skills
About time someone said thank you!
Precooked lobster. Oh thats nasty.
Y para que pregunta si le molesta cocinar ?
Habshi hai kya. Kacha maas kha raha hai
Looks good tho
These look amazing but I couldn't justify wasting that lobster in a roll. Bring on the gnocchi lol
I swear every chef has a bamboo cutting board at home. But only uses those mandatory plastic Polly craps at work.
Please
Those women can’t cook for shit, smh
Atleast she said please this time
At least she said thank you this time.
Bro ima start shooting if i dont see more pleases and thank you idc
He sure can cook! I need to marry a chef. I live in Boston and love lobster rolls without the celery 🤤🤤🤤
Your wife know she can eat How is it that she is still skinny. She should be the size of that black girl named Precious
It's to tell those girls to cook for you  LOL
My brother in law would laugh in my face 😂
My wife makes the sandwiches in our house
This channel is just him grudgingly cooking badass food for his wife and her friends 😂😂
I just love how he says lunch
De la mayonnaise en pot avec du homard !!! Sacrilège 😱!!!👎👎👎
She annoys me with her ungratefulness.......it ruins all his culinary magic for me....
Lunch no that’s a feast
As someone from the NE...this hurt me.  That is an overgrown shrimp roll at best.
As if
Rela masak terus demi ayang
i think this man lifes in a harem
How you got cooked lobster in the fridge
Where do you post the recipe
Just happened to have a. Lobster in the fridge…
Finally a please and thank you ☺️
My auntie made similar comment when I made voodoo rolls I just take the food back
And just by accident you had 5 cameras laying around
He could have put some of the lobster mixture all over his sis-in-,laws "furry taco".
New York city needs this recipe. 😔 Gotta make it myself. Smh It's 9 times out of 10 a disappointment in New York city.
“More lemon” am i the only Guy who knows what this if from
What a nice bro-in-law to go to all that trouble!
Lmao so they being polite now huh lovely manners these women are starting to gain
Must be nice to have a butler
if someone assumed that they had the right to demand i cook something, i'd have chopped up their fingers and cooked them for my dogs 😂 probably just a me thing lol, but it gets on my nerves. if you can't afford me politeness, then you can't afford my frickin food smh
They were already cooked, what’s the problem? 🤣😆😂😉 Great brother in law!😋
🔥👏🔥👏👏🔥👏
"Honey, this tastes like SHIT!!" *throws it in his face* 😋
Ew you ruined it with mayo
Rich people are lucky
So wait. You can eat lobster raw?
Well they actually said "please" this time!!!!
Hey babe, what do you want for lunch?  Sister-in-law: ooh, I want lobster rolls.  Something fishy here 😂

If I heard the “ones at Christmas were bigger” I’d walk right back over there and take it away.
Occasionally we have lobster  in our fridge... love content  guys....
Mercy hes beautiful!!  Those lobster rolls don't look too bad either😂😂
You guys act like he didn't ask them to say these things... Like he just has the exact ingredients, fresh, everytime.
As a wife of a chef I felt this....
Can I borrow your chef husband ..I would be very grateful for him to cook his brilliant meals 😋
She ask less if he charged for meals
Bro leave everything his tattoos tho damn that shit fire as hell
When your answer to "What do you want for lunch?" Is "ooh i want Lobster rolls." You know you aint worked a day in your damn life 😂😂
Lobster has the biggest shit sack ever
Kind guy indeed
All this n she divorced u

"But I have no lobster roll and you have a lobster roll." 😋😚😚
You are awesome chef my guy very proper 👌 and also thanks for not cooking the lobster live on film, It urks me badd ,
I totally missed the British accent until “were biggar”! I guess there’s something going on on that island that others just can’t mimic, thinking about the original top gear vs. the rest… Loved every second! 👍
I love how he always has every ingredient on hand.
Thats lunch. I wouldnt be full
Wow
Why didn’t he say “you welcome”?….. SAY IT!!!!
Best husband ever! 😍😍😍😍😍

Give him your roll 😈😈😈
At least she said please...

Rich Aussies
bro Cook what you want for once
I like how no one noticed the technique used to cut it. There's likely lobster Shit still in that
must be nice to have your fridge stocked  with everything someone could imagine  for a meal !!
Mayo?
What chef use pre done mayo and all that  ...you are ruining the lobster!
What does your wife do?
When a man do the cooking it's called slavery but when a woman did it it's just normal
Was the lobster cooked beforehand?
Love a man that can cook !!!!
Wt  d yo want for lunch...  Anything with cholesterol dads
Omg looks sooo good
At 100k subs, I want him to bring out burnt toast give it to his sister in law and say, that's where all chefs dispose of their garbage.
If you have a fully cooked lobster already to go in your refrigerator you deserve to have to make lobster rolls lol
Yumm!
These women do not appreciate you! 😉
Nah, celery in the lobster roll ruins it. Try one in the Northeast, not this garbage
Love it but to much work for me 🙂
Give me a break
They women serves the men in my household 🤣😂
First time I’ve heard anyone say plz or thank you 🙏
That wasn't even a lobster that's a cheaper crayfish version of a lobster
I wish I was that lobster
You're very patient
Really thought he was gunna make sushi
Great video
I have a husband like that. Cooks all day. I love it 😻
*Her: The one's at Christmas were bigger* *Me: Well So Where You!!*
Was that shyt?
Love it
Yum yum....frm manila
Awe honey, your such a doll. You make whatever it is your guests or wife wants. You remind me so much of my deceased husband he was a great cook also!
Yes but you got to live the extended family if not pretend 😂🥰💐🦋
Are you a chef?
Him: *"Hey babe, what do you want to eat?"* pulls out whatever ingredients he needs out of the fridge. Me: I'll eat whatever leftovers I find. 😅
Never go that far for the sister n laws
#LEVITICUS11
He know he loves doing it 🤣🤣🤣
That looks good...
Great camera skills and editing plus food looks amazing hell yea thats what i call a great content
That is one way to get me to eat seafood because most seafood I hate but this would trick me into eating seafood                           Seafood count- 3
Butter-grilled, top-split hotdog rolls for the win. The New England states of America salute you 🫡 !
Some one asks me for lobster rolls they getting my foot up there ass
Can I have the staffies 😍
Is he a chef in real life? He's awesome!
I enjoy cooking for people but boy someone would HAVE to be putting out for all the nice meals yu prepare every single time.
Is talking to the moon by Bruno Mars legit playing in the background right now... My gf just broke up with me and that's all I've been listening too.. I just cried
does he have a brother...
lmao not you calling out your sister in law for all of youtube to see 😆
Bro !!! Does she ever cook for you ?!
U made it all wrong
If my sister-in-law said the ones at Christmas were bigger I would just take her plate and frisbee it into the lake and say maybe make your own fucking lobster roll
Why you bitching at least you had a cooked lobster in your fridge!
Finally.  She seems a little grateful. Maybe she is showing off for Sis.
And I want a whole Crab Cake sub. L. T. Fried onions. Mayo. Provelone cheese. Thank you. 🙃
I always notice it is the blonds who are so lazy that they make their men that has $$$$. They only marry the rich guys NOT the ones that have a good heart. I guess they are extra lazy. You only see the blinds siting back and their men are the ones working in these videos.
Yuck! You didn't cook the meat dude
I want Korean hot pot
Nothing like a man in the kitchen. This man has a elegance about him.
God bless you you are a good man!!!!!!
Que manera de joder una langosta
For the in-laws hotdogs would of been on the menu..😁  With no bun just beans…
Those are not lobster rolls they're lobster salad sandwiches. There's a difference.
Good services.
Waterfront property. Check. Posse of Doggies. Check. World Class Chef/Hubby/Lover. Check. Lobster rolls. Check. More Lemon. Check.
He is reading our comments guys …..😂😂
The one in blue and white didn’t say Thankyou and should try to be more polite!! Rude ass kids this ain’t ya mommas house!
I wish I was your sister in law
We made the say please.
They better bust down after
You are so good at cooking.
What seasoning was that? I keep rewatching and can’t see the label. 😭😄
They low key banging, so obvious
Ah the 'thank you' finally!!!
Kachha de diya bc
Y’all make me cringe . Sister in law & the wife. I hope she treats you better off camera .
This reminds me of my and my gf, except the other way round.
That was a rude PLEASE. LET THESE WOMEN FEND FOR THEMSELFS.
If he said,  "babe" why did his sister in law answer?
🤣
Wipped
Atleast there's a thank you....
Where can I find one of these husbands 😩
Sisters are doing it for themselves- yeah right!
Well, she gotta have to pay for it one way or another, 😁😆.
Andy doesn't love both of them, He just love to cooks 😁
Gosh.... His cutting skills.😍
I’m so excited for my future partner to be the primary cook and I’ll clean ☺️
at least your wife has respect i seen a video where the 3 girls didn’t even say thanks for you making that nasty ass looking food(probably good tasting just not my cup of tea ) too extravagant for me i guess lmao but always thank whoever cooks you food it’s just a nice thing to do for someone who didn’t have to make you anything
Does he have a sister that can cook like this? Lol
I want lobster rolls too!
They've been reading the the comments about the black of thank yous ahah
They are spoiled! Too old not to say thank you
How nice is he.i was a cook for years it would be a joy to have a husband to this at the drop of a hat..bravo 👏
I liked the "please" and "thank you".
glad to hear thank you..
This guys is a little itch boi. Grow a set you little itch
Ugh…. So simpy 😣😖😖
Love the humor in your recipes!😜
And that is how you ruin a lobster!
Thats langusta not lobster
Why doesn't he cook the crab?
Spiders of the sea, no one will change my mind 🤮
Bro who will cook the lobster it's not raw
Who is this guy and why is he so popular
Too much trouble, how about a sandwich?
Did u ever cooked a meal for ur parents? If not plz do it...
They called him the Chef-Simp.
Me thinking it's lobster egg roll which would be nice. Still looks very good but sadly I can't eat shellfish. I can cook them just make sure I prepare myself before handing. ❤❤❤ for the idea sir 😺
Bro of my imaginary sister had a husband that cooks like that I'd be going over every single day for dinner you best believe cuz I cannot cook!
Gorgeous knife skills!
Who’s recording it? 🤔😳
Love to have a cook chilled lobster on hand for rolls!
Millennial kiddos should watch this for good manners” PLEASE AND THANK YOU “

Never seen a lobster like that before
You could say no
He's a peer Not a man
Lol look yummy
womens job
Some people could just ask for what they want and there's some people who don't have a place to live a decent and they would just like to have clean water to drink clean water to drink that's all they wanted some clean water to drink and some real real food we're not talking about GMO but real food to eat that's healthy and clean clean positive place to live that's not a cracker Jack box God is answering their prayers
I want a husband like that!!! Do they come in black!!! Lol 😆😆😆
If you know my comment about Mr Nice guy the other girl(sister,bestF?) just proves my theory.  At least they read the comments and said Please and Thanks so I guess that makes up for the extra curricular activities. 😆
"Babe"seems stuck up and ungrateful
I think they took the hint from the video of her and her friends who all ordered something different and there wasn't even a thank you and at the end she looked at it and just looked back up sipping her wine. Needless to say the comments went off! 😂 😂
GOOD JOB LADIES....AND CHEF
Maybe get her big ass up and cook you something, she don't need nothing else to eat for a good minute.
That deserves a 3way
Damn sir u get down in the kitchen 🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯👌👌👌👌 looks so good
I JUST WANT TO BE RELATED 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷‍♀️👋🏾✌🏾🦀PLEASE😁
Lobster for lunch?!
Your wife never says please or thank you
Lobster roll my ass my ass when you get a ham sandwich
You are fantastic at what you do.✨❤️
You mean sisters in law.
She doesn't deserve lobster rolls. A 40 of old E and a black eye seems more her speed. Actually, forget the old E
Thank You for the lobster rolls and chips...mmm mmm mmm..
Babe made her Sis say Please! And  Babe said Thank You...it's a working progress.
Wouldn’t have her, spoiled
Ya ok some fake stuff here. !!!
What a great chef to cook for sisters in law? be good n no more than that to sis in laws...
Much better! Your very talented!
FINALLY they starting saying please after we all came for them.
Finally some manners. Please and thank you.
So cruel. That poor life of the lobster
For all that nice food, I hope she suck it everyday! Together with her sister in law! ✌🏼
wow and no thank u
HAHAHA LOVE HIS REACTION TO SIS INLAWS
2…hours…..later….
As a Mainer this hurts me. Wayyyy to much celery. Honestly you don’t have to use celery at all. I’m a big fan of warm butter and a toasted bun, but if you do it’s just a fine small amount to accent the lobsters natural flavor. That’s enough celery to make my eyes water 😂
Save The Fisch 🐠
I am Vegetarian
Yes,finally!!! the sister in law says lobster roll’s please and thank you!!
Damn. Now I want a lobster roll
Finally a “Please” & “Thank you”
Great cook!
This guy needs some appreciation from his girl and family..... Somehow it feels like they take him for granted..... As if any guy can do what he does
It's sisters-in-law.
He must love his sister in law alot
Video after video I don’t think her friends and family respect him outside of videos. He’s  amazing !
I Love How My Guy stay Ready, He's on Autopilot with hits cooking Allot of People over Think There cooking Like they haven't been cooking all there life
It's not funny... what a snotty, ungrateful sister in law.
Men! Catch the ways  of this man! Yummy!
Lucky!
Sister in laws or master in laws
DAMN,IS IT ME OR  ,ARE THOSE  HEFFER NOT FAMILIAR  WITH THE WORD THANK-YOU. !!! I HEARD ONLY  ONLY  ONE,THANK-YOU 🙏
What did you use for the lobster rolls, what was that Mayonnaise you used?
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Yum
This channel reminds me oh that show bluey
Why Mayo
Wife: "pLeAsE"  Me remembering the one with her friends where they all wanted something different and none of them say please OR thank you: 🤔
That lobster ain’t cookeddd
Wow has he a brother?
It’s insane how angry you make me
You did that, looks good
I just luv this guy! Wish I could get one of him to go😂
Sisters in law. Not sister in laws
That please was welcome!
These are the worst… dude can throw down , but the girls always suck 🤣
Where did you get the lobster?
The craziest thing about this is the fact you ask her what she wants and she actually knows
Title sounds like a porno, 0/10, 40 seconds of my life wasted. I pulled my pants down and everything. My penis is now cold and my day is ruined.
I would love to have a husband that COOKS!!!
The World's Top Ten Funniest One Liners ever!  1. I didn't fight my way to the top of the food chain to be a vegetarian.  2. I used to think I was indecisive, but now I'm not too sure.  3. He who laughs last thinks slowest.  4. According to my best recollection, I don't remember. 5. A clear conscience is usually the sign of a bad memory. 6. Gravity: It's not just a good idea, it's the LAW! 7. Be nice to your kids. They'll choose your nursing home. 8. If Barbie is so popular, why do you have to buy her friends? 9. I just let my mind wander, and it didn't come back.  10. Vacation begins when Dad says, "I know a short cut."   Maybe the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
Who write script? 🤣
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates—🎈
I'll see that the audacity to tell your sister to say please by her friends to that there and just say looks good and don't say thank you or please or anything to you but then look at your sister and say say please that's not cool
Omg !! U did that sir !! I don’t eat seafood 🦞 but it s so beautiful how u take time and ask your wife (sis n laws ) your awesome !!
No cooking involved lol why you complaining?
The more lemon taste test shows he’s legit at his craft 👌
These fucking videos make me brain hurt
A woman not doing anything. Seems about right.
Looks yummy..but raw..
Would like to be there helping you cook
And you just make it for her?
Everyone has leftover lobster in their fridge.
I piacerebbe averti come marito!!
Couldn’t hear her at the end
What was the point of the stupid intro ? Just cook the damn thing, we all know that is what you had planned !
Hahah comments really got on them last vid bringing out the thank you’s this time
Your a real man when you do anything your girl wants these days
No way she said please
Dude.. stop doing this
Rude woman
Needs Old Bay in that lobster salad !
I must make this, what was in the spice jar?
I don’t think he wants the praise he’s a chef so he’s clearly a masochist
Exactly! I don't care if this is staged. Just do what your Mommy taught you and that is please and thank you! Simple. I wish I had someone caring cooking my everyday meals.
Fuckers said thank you and please
I wish this guy was my brother in law
i fucking love you
Bruno Mars song in the background ❤️❤️
At least there was a please this time 😂😂
This guy knows how to hold a knife.  A lot of YT chefs don't.
At least she said please.
Men knowing how to cook is a dying art. Women to, its just dying all around. I also dont know how to cook to be fair
Wonder how he feels about mother-in-laws?
Please, which spice did you use?
What if one time you were just like "Nah" I'm making what I want.
Lol fake ASF why not just do the lobster roll vid minus the fake "sister in law" premise, also try using a decent mayo not that cheap sh#t praise stuff smh
Liked and subscribed) Amazing content!
I knew right when they said lobster rolls, he was going to make cold ones 🤮🤮🤢🤢
The Man!
What was the third thing you chopped up? You put it on top of the lobster rolls. It looked like leeks🤔
He is definitely puttin it down on both of them... i am jelly
YOU'RE A GENIUS, MATE!!
Finally, a "please" and a "thank you," but did he just call his sister-in-law's babe? Lol
Lobster came falling from sky onto his board
Crayfish
Rich people crap 😂
That's a hell of a lot of work just for lunch.
So do I please!!
Haven't they heard of Leon the Lobster? If you know, you know!
The wife was like only I can demand food, you must say please peasant lol
Lmao I feel.tbe sister in law vibes. 1000%
I would have slipped a little cayenne in the sister-in-law’s.
Took a bunch of people to shit talk your wife to get her  to thank you for your hard work? Smh
It's amazing that whatever she wants to eat the ingredients are always in the fridge.
Lobsters was pre cooked?
I get it's a bit but if someone does that in my kitchen I'm taking that plate back
Larry the Lobster 🦞 and his entire family have been brutally killed , # justification for Larry
Sister in law... Your banned until you learn some manners... Ungrateful!

Damn reading a book at home during the day i
Nice to see some gratitude lol
I need this kind of man.
That looks amazing 💕💕💕
Hey maybe I’m weird for asking this, but why do you always ONLY play 10% of a song?
I’m pretty sure them being rude is a part of the aesthetic.
Where's the Old Bay?
I don’t even offer my sister in laws water.
Awesome!
Somebody has been reading the comments…(Please and Thank you)
She said PLEASE I'm Amazed..
Much better with complimenting this Man!!
They understand

You always a beta or is it just for the views?
“IN-LAWS I KNOW!”
Looks Delicious 😋 I
finally someone said please
Wow you are Amazing cook
Clearly taken onboard the negative feedback about female manners!
Yummmm.
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins

Everyone wondering why babe doesn't cook is missing the whole point of this channel He's the fabulous chef... She's the babe He loves cooking for her
*sisters-in-law  You're welcome
People be complaining his wife not saying please, but I'm happy she knows what she wants to eat if you asked!
lol I feel like sister-in-law not saying thank you and asking for bigger crisps was a direct shot at us. Anyway glad the comment section was able to affect some positive change in the world. You’re now getting your well deserved ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ from babe 🤣 We can all sleep easy now😌
I knew he was a chef.  Your cooking skills are good.
Yummy. Sister in laws 😆😆😆
Exactly! I don't care if this is staged. Just do what your Mommy taught you and that is please and thank you! Simple. I wish I had someone caring cooking my everyday meals.
I’m sad for you. The best part of the lobster roll is the huge claw meat
Hey Andy, New subscriber from Montana,US. Do you post any of your recipes anywhere? Always looking to whip up a lobster roll. Keep ‘em coming! Cheers 🍻
Sister says please but friends dont hummm
Yum
😋😋😋
Stop 🛑 cooking for this women!!, Let them cook for you. You already work your ass to hard to pay the bills. Please 🥺🙏 stop it. These women are becoming more lazy.
Someone's a bit spoiled lol!!
On 1 million we want babe and sister in law cooking for you...
Where's the thank you Andy 😂
And the other one just couldn't say thank you😒
Simp....  I do the same for my wife.
I always have 2 fully cooked lobsters waiting in the fridge just in case they ever want lobster rolls.
Their still rude... can't stand them!!!
Haha, they added the please because of all the complaints from that one video
POV when you Wife cant cook 😂😂😂
Was it I alone who used to enjoy not saying them Thanx or Plzz??? Like a queen
😅😊
I got a question if you don't mind answering um... Who record your videos
I'm just going to believe they are being overly rude for the video, because nobody is this rude to someone who is this nice to them! And, Sir if your wife is rude like this for real,grow a spine, and stop letting her bully you  this isn't cute or lovely!
Wow you have to say thankyou
Amazing!!! You make it sooo simple N quick
Oh finally the other chick says please ! Bout time ! They read the comments ..
I don't even know why he moans first. That was totally quick and easy.
"Please" is such a western thing (will get offended with the absence of it), not there's anything wrong with that
...
Can you prepare the food and then just throw it on the ground in front of them
You got 3 frenchies!!! Food looks good to bud!!! Keep it up!!!
Her face would of been planted into that lobster roll for saying that.
Great👍👏😊
Yum 😋
I would spit out my coffee & collapse if one day Babe AND her Sister both cooked Andy a meal...pre dinner cocktails, entree, mains, dessert, and after dinner coffee with after dinner mints (all hand-made) lol!
