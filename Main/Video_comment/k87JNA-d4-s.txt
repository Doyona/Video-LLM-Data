goosebumps . felt this.
This sinning in a church bar threw off a lot with how I feel about Joyner. Smh
❤️
Not the best remix he has done. Something feels off and disjointed about it. I think if any other rapper did this I would say it is amazing but I expect a lot from Joyner.
A yo Joyner, please do all gold everything.
🖤🖤🖤
I,I,I,I,I me,me,me,me. Yes we get it.... you're better than everyone.

Who is he talking about?
“i wish i could spend more time with my (daughter) but i know I’m doing my best..” 📠 💯
You verse me ni**a thats like a whale pushing a seal around
This man is the truth. I love how other people can rip someone else's beat better than they did.... #comeharder

Okay but when are you gonna put out new shit with Marshall 😂 fire remix 🔥
I fuck with Joyner Lucas hard!! 🔥👑☘️
Joyners lyrics are the most innovative in rap. He definitely has an illuminated blessed and holy vessel with a voice and a mind like one of a kind.  I want to pick his brain and get some lessons from him… keep your eyes peeled Joyner I know I’m gonna make it and hopefully get to meet the man that inspired me to start writing again, I have no other ways to make it after my pops sells his business I’m gonna need the music more than ever so I’ve never taken my journal more seriously and it’s been effortless lately, hope to meet you someday J PEAAAACE—- SHOWME!!!
My new favorite Joyner song!  🔥
I think he's on packs level. Or I'm dumb?
🤷🏽‍♂️ https://youtu.be/af9HTbsIIVY
The day his remixes are on Spotify is the day my life will be completed
Yo joyner remix that soulja song make it clap! I know you'll murder that beat!!!
Bro!!! Joyner Remix Thot shit!!! That beat is fire for your vocals
If this man makes one more good remix
I made so much bread i bought a crib and took a shit in it
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This man is my favorite rapper today! This song bumps and came out just in time for some hard times. Thank you
"You're no different than all of these industry niggas, i thought you were special and awesome. Now you're selling your soul and just hopping on records with anyone, nigga you lost it"
🔥🔥🔥Joyner never disappoints.
Sounds like a more lyrical drake to me...
Eh. 77 percent. No clouds. no cap.
I got one crib Ion live in it😂😂😂😂😂😂
I get disappointed when artists make bars that sound sac religious. We must remind ourselves we can be powerful amongst our peers, but we are not nearly as powerful, say when we are paired against god or nature. Whatever you believe in our ego is invisible when we are gone, all that’s left is our legacy.   That being said Joyner is a beast. Love his flow, and love this beat.
Nice 👍 Thank You. Amen.
How can Dax say he’s the next rap god ?????? Has he not listen to Joyner
he bodied this song better than the Original, but because his name aint lil something he wont get views/...

My daughter was -13 years old when this came out. But you better believe she's gunna hear it when she's 13.

I loved that he killed it with 22gz flow!!
Yuhh
🔥🔥🔥PERIOD
King los took that one easily
"I might buy a church to just in case I want to sin in it" 😮🔥🔥
The fact that Joyner is one of Eminem’s favorite rapper is insane, if they was to make a mixtape or whole album together it’ll be game over for the rap game fr 🔥🔥🔥
Bro you my favorite rapper 💯
Ok nice
smart position
BARS
your lane is the whole fuckin pool, my dude..
Bro Joyner get together with the dude AK , he's coming up. He does some nasty remixes as well. He can spit too. You 2 on a track would be straight fire!!

Bruh only reason 1000 ppl dislike this..... Idk why? 😂😂😂
Better than toosi
Okayyy, Yuhh ‼️💯
The best in the game right now 🔥
Finally I find the original song
Anotha beat dat was made 4 a real EMCEE!! POOH YOUR PRODUCT WAS SHIT COMPARED TO THIS LONG LIVE REAL EMCEES!! GREAT JOB JOYNER
To be fair, I never thought you rapping about material made you trash.. This is your life and your progress... you're rapping about your experiences, and solidifying it through your bars. Congratulations!!
This remixes are dope
I haven’t seen this dude in two years but this fire
Yo u should do a devils work pt.2
That king los remix tho
Who went harder on this remix ?  Joyner or King Los
Joyner is legit a different level than all the other newer rappers. J Cole are right there with him but none of the others can fuck with him. Grateful that we have these 3, the game wouldnt be shit right now without them. Im not going to front I do like some of the mumble rappers but thankfully we have some lyricists
King los just did one.....no shade to the original but this is Joyner and los song now 😂
Thank you so much for inspire me,dope remix Joyner big respect from Serbia! 👀✌️
This is real hip- fuckin- hop ain’t nobody mumbling in this shit
This wont it
I love where a remix doesn't change the beat into a shitty party remix
Dope
I get a mad "Rest in Piss" feel, hearing this beat.... Damn Rap, quit pulling me back in....
"Back on my remix shit, please dont sue me." 😂
This is way better than pooh shiesty on it
New music wit Marshall 👀 👀 ?
Yo Joyner, will we ever hear a Joyner Lucas and Twista Track. We heard a Eminem track, Tech N9ne track, E40 track, Will Track n Busta Rhymes track. Gotta add another great legend n make more history.
I hit like AS SOON AS I see it's Joyner
How come iTunes don’t have this song
This shit slaps on god
Better than Jcold
King Los version is 10000x better.
shit was fire!   also am I the only one who wants to hear Joyner do a track with Papoose ? cause i think it would be insane
Goes so fucking hard. Every single time. Return of the remix KING
Not his best freestyle, but better than the original song tho
Such a Beast Talent, mad respect!
"Yeah, I made soo much bread I bought a crib to take a shit in it..." Mind blown...🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.
I like Joyner but King Los just destroyed this beat
Joyner one of the hottest in the game 🔥
Holy shit this is fire
Damn I  can't do this beat now
“I pay a stripper in Crypto”
king los just bodied this too
You should put all your remix’s on Apple Music
Damn this why you my #1 Joyner
Had to say it twice for em I pay a stripper in crypto 🔥🔥🔥
I'm not feeling this. Joyner could do alot better.
Aye man!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
*coughs KingLos 😤
Been here since The Snapple remix
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Some man come along, humble and open hearted and they change shit. This is the reason I can't listen to these crayon rappers, once you see the 50. Cal that 22. just doesn't bang like when you first hear it. That 50. Cal goes through the engine block
“I pay a stripper in crypto”  Fuckin hilarious
King los got the hardest remix to this easily
1.3 k dislikes 😭😂 oh okay
🔋🧪
Bruh i work SO HARD TO MAKE DOPE BEATS how in the hell is this nursery melody two dollar piano sounding beat the one that gets put on lmao. Joyner MURDERED this one he’s a goat but that beat is just ass
Me, F***in' with the algorithm 💯.
King los just murdered this beat 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵 go listen
https://youtu.be/_wYRCdV9us0
Check out the KING LOS, Back in Blood freestyle. It's more LYRICAL, less cadence. This is good but not LOS.
King Los bodied this joint something vicious.
You ain’t know my lifes a movie? I sold crack to pookie 🔥🔥🔥
Nice
HEEEEEES BAAAAAAACK !!🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
One of his worse songs/remixes so far. He can do way better but it's chill.
Joyner always Goes Hard, on these remix’s! I wnana see MERK & JOYNER do an album.
Someone who thought about a natura bullet for too long

King Los just killed erry1 on this. No1 even close
Yeah I made so much bread,  I bought a crib and take a shit in it . I'm dead
Y’all remember when Wayne was doing all of those remixes back in like 08-10? Well joyner is doing the same mad props pimp.
Joyner takes your beat  Now it’s his beat  Your irrelevant

This man is the master of making remixes🔥
this one sucks compared to the other ones
God the Father sent His Son, Jesus, to take your punishment for your sins: to die on the cross.  For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23, KJV) You must repent of all your sins, and believe and trust in Jesus. He loves you. He took your punishment, and suffered, because He loves you. He can forgive you. He can give you a new heart. Have a relationship with Him. He wants to have a relationship with you. God wants you to be His child.  God bless you all.
508 Joyner!!!

When you gon' pull some new shit out the arsenal?" I'm back on my remix shit, don't sue me, nigga, I'm too unruly I might slide on a hoe like Toosie, bitch, I'm too dang groovy, ooh Niggas try and cancel me like Boosie, all y'all hoes is goofy But, yeah, you know my life's a movie, I sold crack to Pookie Look, she in love with the cocaine, I'm in love with the dope gang Try to cook crack with a oven and propane Try to make a dollar back when I ain't have no name But niggas told me that I had to stay in my own lane I jumped in the water and started makin' my own wave I'm watchin' the pool splash, they told me don't move fast And every nigga doin' better than me, I blew past Now niggas look at me, like, "How the fuck did he do that?" I got one crib, I don't live in it The other one is big enough to probably put my other muhfuckin' crib in it But one crib, I made a clubhouse and stuffed all my step kids in it And then I built me a trap house and let all the fiends take a hit in it And I might buy a church too, just in case I wanna sin it Put a hot tub in the front row, let all my hoes come swim in it Yeah, I made so much bread, I bought a crib to take a shit in it You talk about it, I'm livin' it, you brag about it, I been did it And I got your bitch in the whip ridin' shotgun with the ceiling down You let her down, I feel her up just 'cause the bitch feelin' down I don't know if her ass real but I do know that it's really round I think that I'm tall enough for her to give me head without kneelin' down Fake niggas only really lie just because of prolly how real it sounds Please shut the fuck up anytime I bring somebody real around You versus me, nigga? That's like a whale pushin' a seal around Tell me, how many dead rappers you think it takes to fill the ground? And bitch, I'm in pimp mode, I only know what the pimps know The man in the mirror is schizo, I pay a stripper in crypto I pay a stripper in crypto, I do not care if you lit, though I hit my plug from the flip phone, I'm sellin' pebbles to Flinstones Scam nightly, sellin' whatever the strand might be, yeah Get like me, all of my packages sealed tightly, yeah I had a record deal, then I drop a label, nigga, come take a chance like me You niggas cannot advance like me, you'll give Atlantic back the advance like me I got the upper hand, mm, and I got the other hand icy My diamonds movin' like Chris Brown, you know I love when they dance hyphy Ayy, ayy, only nigga that told his girlfriends 'bout my other girlfriends in front of my side lil' bitch and wifey Give a fuck about security in the club, we gon' ride Give a fuck if it's a quarantine or not, we still outside The last nigga tried to play me talkin' crazy, then he died Like them cheap-ass hoes [?], catch you slippin', we gon' slide Ooh, ooh, catch you slippin', we gon' slide Put that rubber on that grip, then we gon' cut your ass outside Send 'em goonies on that mission, it go trip and you gon' hide When you get hit that blicky you gon' wish that you done died  [Outro] Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, Joyner Ayy, ayy

🔥🔥🥶🥶💯💯
Hey brothers and sisters, I love y'all and it's just been in my heart today to share that Jesus love y'all so much and unconditionally. I don't know how much time we left on this earth before Jesus comes, but I want all of us to be ready when He does. Let's leave these things of this world behind for in scripture it says in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. " Also in 2 corinthians 4:18" So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal." Time is so short. And I always say this" I want all of us to be saved. " Jesus is coming back soon." with tears in my eyes I love you guys. Let's take Jesus and His words seriously in these time were in. I know the road isn't easy because there are so much distractions and temptations in this life. But through prayer and fasting we can overcome them. I don't want to force anything on anybody or even force them to do something they don't. But if you were to see your mother about to get hit by a big truck, you would do everything to try and save her. So I do the same thing for us about the wrath of God that is to come. I don't want anyone I love, know/don't know or even those who hate or dislike me to face such things. Because I know every soul is precious to God and are valuable to Him. Because before we were born He know us, He knitted us in our mother's womb, He called us to be His children . His love for us is so great and so strong, it's beyond human comprehension, that even the angels in heaven don't understand it. So I want to tell you it's time to get ready, time to prepare ourselves for the Second Coming of Christ, for the trails and tribulations and for the rapture. As you can see, so many people have turned away from God. The world has become so immoral, wicked, disgusting and violent. Killing people without any care or heart. And that shows that the love of God is growing cold in the hearts of people. Please be ready for when the Son of Man comes. Time is running out. Let's not leave this world with regrets. Because I tell you this, my biggest regret is not knowing Jesus Christ earlier. I love you Guys and Jesus loves you too, that's why He didn't think twice about dying on the Cross for us, knowing that we may not even love Him back. Please take what was said today in consideration because ready or not Jesus Christ is coming back believe it or not Jesus is coming back.   How to be saved? To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life and that he died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected on the third day🙏🏾. Also one must repent and turn away from thier sin. NOW, is the time to turn to JESUS, do it before its too LATE and the DOOR of Grace is Shut.  Prayer of Salvation in Jesus Christ🙏  Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior.  Spreading the Gospel on every content🙏❤️.

Joyner, Lil Wayne, & Merkules are the best at killing other niggas beats.
That beat feel like an influence from the "Micheal Myers breakdance" video back from like....The early 00s.

His remixes always kill the originals 👌
https://youtu.be/mbMarnroBzg
https://youtu.be/mbMarnroBzg
Nothing against Joyners bars but does he ever feel like a bitch for constantly piggybacking so hard?
Superstar shit never miss🙏🙏🙏
🤘🏽🤘🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽
This song gonna come up when people will search back in blood 😁😁
One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self 
Well he just murdered pooh shiesty haha durk never had a career to begin with
Crypto for the strip show
Imagine a Joyner, Token , Hopsin, and Eminem collab.
Bro killed that Shit!!!
Back on his remix ish
Rhyme schemes on pt
Mid
Joyner, you are a great story teller and know how play with words well! But you can’t remix a classic song about robbing and killing and just talk about your son and how smart you are. You forgot the whole spirit and feel of this song! Pooh still has better version sorry
https://youtu.be/L2dOs2_0V8g
Paying for stripping services in crypto is probably the worst financial decision that could’ve been made. Pay her the fiat and let your interest build. *Not financial advice*
Bad Chester?  Nah nah WorstChester ya ever seen. 🔪
Give a f**k if its a quarantine or not we still outside... WIT A MASK OFF I agree, legend and no one Joynya on that Mountain Top.
This is fire .
I dunno if her ASS real but damn it’s really ROUND!!😹 #SHEESH4JOYER🔥
Haven't replayed a song this hard in a while .... Lines backpacking lines, keep it coming we are here with u 😊
U vs me is like a whale pushing a seal around Hmmp!  1 line... a thousand words 🔥
One big future  KSI and Joyner Why its not already happend
https://youtu.be/EC-0E3Gc8Wg
"When you gon make  new music wit Marshall?" - That's a question though樂 yes it is
i just love his voice 🔥
You deserve everything that’s coming to you except old age and bad karma
This is war mode Joyner on rampage.
Its better than the original one
How many dead bodies will feed the ground?
As soon as the song aint his, Joyner becomes the hottest rapper in the game
Got us making that stank face again 🔥
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Finally 😈
For real...Joyner is one of 'em dat kills hiphop every time 🔥
holy, my mans just snapped
Never dissapointed 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn joyner!
Love Joyner but lately Tom Macdonald has put himself as the goat.
🔥🔥🔥
I was looking for new terror Reid and this came up?
This goes harder than an aisan parent whose child got a B.
Every time he hit a remix that shit SLAP
ANOTHER ONE 🔥❤️
Youtube did me dirty notifying me two days later
Joyner  one of the best in the game!
Buy a church?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
You funny for this one Joyner lol..
I need to hear a collab with Joyner and Merk ASAP
Gotta admit everytime joyner jump on a song with someone have u noticed they rap better. Lil baby had the best verse in Ramen and oj. E40 killed it as well. Joyner keep it up. What you need to do is have drake on a song with you and just murder that shit to show people who the true goat is. You taking over and the industry don't wanna admit it. Hold it down for the independent rappers.
🙏If you are reading this and you are a aspiring professional singer, musician, recording artist I wish and hope and pray you have worldwide success!!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Real fan here Joyner ♥️♥️
Montana of 300 need to get on this ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
joyner never misses how tf does he do this shit
Tell em
He kinda copied Pooh Shiesty
I pay a striper in crypto? You know how hard that is ? What he means by that is because crypto goes up and down and what does a striper do ? 😲😲😲
Miss old joyner, by far his worst remix to date. You can hear the lack of passion in his voice and weak bars.
That was sloppy for Joyner
I paid a stripper in crypto 🚀🚀🚀
Joyner is too hard 🔥🔥🔥
Wow🔥🔥🔥backwords
https://youtu.be/7H_kui2tgYc
At 1:44 Joyner Lucas said " I might buy a church too so I can sin in it and put a hot tub in the front row and let all my hoes come swim in it"  straight up blasphemy.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Df3NIaewyJo MSFshizz back in blood freestyle

Joyner Lucas looks like drakes cooler older brother
Joyner is always brutally honest- even with himself. That's why I respect his content.
BACK WITH THE REMIXES!!!
Late remix
He is falling into the mainstream fame trap though: money, fame, and women...you’re better than this Joyner c’mon man
One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self 🎈
Why EM drop his own shit the same day🤔🤔🤔
YOHANAN(JOHN/JUAN) 14:6 "I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH ME" "YO SOY EL CAMINO Y LA VERDAD Y LA VIDA. NADIE VIENE AL PADRE SINO POR MI".......

Duriko

Spotify??
Noma sana !! 🤷🏾‍♂️
Hello, ❤️ I just wanted to say that, we have all sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God. Jesus died on the cross for the forgiveness of sin and rose from the dead proving He had power of sin and death. As long as you repent and truly accept him as your Lord and Saviour you will be Born again (saved); go to heaven🙏❤️   Our sin is breaking Gods law e.g: the 10 commandments. Most of us have all Lied, Stolen something, Looked at a woman with lust(Pornography), used Gods name in vain etc. These are only 4 of the 10 commandments and just one of them separates us from God for eternity since God is Holy and it stops us from entering his kingdom when we die. Anyways Jesus took our punishment, so that we can have eternal life as long as we trust in Jesus for our salvation and not our selves, it’s a gift from God which no man should boast about. Once someone truly trusts in Jesus, they are born again and a completely new person spiritually speaking, and anyone around them will most likely say they see a different person e.g: they do good things now instead of bad. Another benefit but shouldn’t be the focus is freedom from addiction which Is the main reason I’m sending this. Once you are born again God will place in you desires to hate sin and hate porn and equip you with spiritual tools to fight your addiction and conquer it, I’m not gonna lie and say it goes straight away but with work you can once and for all conquer it and never watch it again however the main point is going heaven instead of hell.  How to be saved - Agree with God that we are in need of His help and that we cannot save ourselves. Recognise what Jesus Christ has done for us on the cross (died in our place and resurrected) ; accept the gift that He offers us by trusting in Him alone for salvation. Receive the ability to turn away from our sin and towards God because of His help   Hope you all have a nice day God bless you all and your families❤️; remember Jesus loves you❤️ https://youtu.be/1IhHfc61aJk https://youtu.be/XdlhJiEDqJ8 https://youtu.be/HTs5zQfqbLw

Number 18 trending on the tube WITH NO VIDEO LOL
His freestyles/remixes be better than the original
This song slap
Banger🔥🔥🔥
Joyner Lucas will always be my favorite and busta rhymes and Eminem logic and Twista tech n9ne along with twisted insane and yelawolf  I like a lot of these rappers that rap fast and that always know when to release  a fast flow and when not to its like getting in a fight you need to know when to strike and not to strike and singing when you hit a high note you got to find balance I do a lot of these talents and also dancing and other things too I shall goat joyner  for his work and when his son grows up I would love to do a song with him and joyner lucas  cause when his son will start rapping like him dang its gonna be really good  but for now let's talk about doing a song with JOYNER LUCAS I'm 13 years of age I can now do anything with my talents I would love to do a song with him  and when he passes away it will be really sad and when his sin grows up I will do a song with him my dad showed me who joyner lucas was and my dad showed me who token was so love to joyner lucas man also my rap name and all my others on social media (except for twitter Facebook and twitch) are jem krystals  also I have rap fame which is a kinda good rap app
Your flow doesn't match the beat at all bruv

🔥🔥🔥
He's a monster. This is real rap
I like the original but its good to have a "Real MC" on this beat. Shit goes hard. No offense to Durk and Sheisty, they make good songs, but Joyner can run circles around them lyrically. Its just facts.
🎖️🎖️🥇🥇
@joynerlucas this shit is to fire for anybodys ears 😍😍😍
This dude has an ability that’s unmatched. Only a few others can keep up with him.

"Just hoppin  on records with anyone" is an interesting line. Coz i do admit i kinda lost some respect for him when he dropped those tracks with that women beater Chris Brown. But despite that still a fan and still one of the best rappers going around today.
On fire 🔥 as always

Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit NeedGod.com.

Joyner Raps like he’s mad he even has to share a space with other “rappers” The man is having seizures on beats. Wtf 🤯
This shit is 🔥
Moment of silence for the beat, Joyner murdered it in cold blood, no remorse
Y remix everything that blows up 😂
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)
This ain't it
I’m glad somebody remixed this cause the original is 🗑
I’m a Joyner fan but honestly this didn’t impress me.

Ok this hard tho fr fr
Free palestine! Dont care if this is relevant or not. Awareness should be shared and i wont stop until the grave situation in palestine is recognized and justicr is served to the criminals in Israel who are oppressing innocence! SHARE YOUR VOICE PEOPLE! BLM knows cruelty and oppresion lets raise our voices togethor
nothing but 🔥🔥
Man I was expecting so much more from joyner on this beat. No double time rapping, no deep cutting bars. It's still good and I love his remixes but he needs to get back in his bag. Maybe drop another Tory diss idk
Joyner the church line was distasteful. Shouldn't say stuff like that
PLEEEEEEEEEEEASE PUT YOUR REMIXES ON APPLE MUSIC!!
🔥🔥
I hope u live up to what u said brother cuz i been bumping your tracks since before u came up and i was thinking everything u said about urself. Dont let distractions and money change you. God has a plan for us all and your blessed. Bring something pure and you’ll see it multiply. God bless

Shit slaps!
"I pay a stripper in crypto "   CRYPTO JUST WENT MAINSTREAM BOYS!
damn
Joyner the GOAT but I feel like he was holding back.
Just curious for anybody that will answer this. Is the rap game mostly about bragging and talking shit to the people that listen to you?  Has it always been like that or am I just now noticing it?  Still appreciate the art regardless.
Bra I've been waiting for another remix 🔥🔥
Better than the original
When this man speaks my parents dance and is hard to do that in this generation
This has 50 cent vibes but maybe that’s just me

This nigga to honest best real rapper alive
Love his music & this remix just not the part about a church w/ a hot tub & ho’s in it. Not a religious person but I guess it ain’t good if it don’t shock u lol
Ngl joyner always fucking up all the good songs on my playlists cuz i cant enjoy the originals anymore compared to joyner's versions lol
yo ass round⁉️⁉️
Lol I bought a crib just to take a shit in it.
He ate this
Guess im the only one telling truths again. This sucked. Not his worst effort but still Pooh Shiesty out rapped Joyner and that cant be good.
im here for this murder👹
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Goat
I’m a dad that works crazy hours and I’m no longer with the mother of my son, so that line “I wish I could spend more time with my son, but I know that I’m doing my best.” Hit me hard AF! I love Joyner’s music but especially his remix’s!
The part about the church had me dead ☠️ 🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is a long shot but. Back in blood=Pooh Shiesty=signed to Gucci Mane. Joyner Lucas=ties to Eminem. That would be the craziest collab ever. Pooh, Gucci, Joyner and Slim Shady.
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_neAVIxhsIyAftg4Sr5s9aut_2QxSXy1Ng
the joyner remix's return, NEVER been a bad remix
Lyrics are fucking dope
Joyner does your track better than you.
i might buy a church too just incase i wanna sin in it.....BARRZZZ 🔥
If the freestyle subject matter was more themed this freestyle would be way better he start talking goon/back in blood shit at the end which throws everything before it off IMO
"I pay a stripper in crypto.." Mannnn I felt 😂
THAT'S THE JOYNER I LOVE
Joyner lucas🤟🤟🔥🔥
Idk this is whack. Sounds like back pack rap. Joyner fell off the moment he took a deal... Just like every other artist.
Joyner + piano = 🔥
Absolutely insane. Bars on top of bars feel like I'm in prison
I paid a stripper with Cryptho  Yeahh nigga tell them. Fuck the Dollar Crypto is Future

I'm waiting for  "If joyner lucas remix your song, it's not yours anymore" comment
THIS FIRE
This nigga don’t miss
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming
Garbage af. I can put together better lyrics. This man has no element of surprise. Same shit diffrent breathe. All the flow sound the same. WHACK
Top grade remixes like always!!!

Nice beat… I should make an instrumental 🤔🤔
Let’s goooo lil 2z mention?!?!!
Joyner looking like kratos lol
DEAR WORLD This is for everyone and anyone who comes across this.  There’s a significant reason why you’re here. Please take this seriously.  Decide today to turn away from unbelief in what Jesus did for you and believe.   Romans 3:21-26 But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished—he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.

I'm surprised he didnt do a beatbox remix
孟子说了他在四十岁就能不动心，于是公孙丑说：这样看起来，老师比我们齐国那位鼎鼎大名而在秦国大出风头的勇士孟贲还更加厉害。孟子却说：我四十不动心，也不算什么难事嘛！其实，告子比我更早就能不动心了。  孟子和告子，在学问上尽管意见相左，但孟子并不因此而歪曲事实，对方好的就是好的。所以他说告子比他更早便能不动心，这句话孟子毫不隐讳地说出来，绝对不会嫉妒而隐瞒。这也可说是圣人与凡夫的不同之处。  这里公孙丑提到的孟贲，是战国时代有盛名的人，相当于今日的拳王阿里。为什么说孟子比孟贲更厉害？因为对于功名富贵不动心，必须有很大的勇气。例如在街上看见一只名贵的手表，价钱虽然高，自己的经济能力足够买下来，戴在手上可向人炫耀财富，于是动了心想买。如果说硬是不买，不动心，那也要一点勇气才能切断那想买的欲望。很多事情，一般人都是看得通，但下不了决心，拿不出勇气。佛家有一部经典，名为《能断金刚般若波罗密经》，就是强调能切断一切妄想、烦恼，这的确需要大勇气。所以公孙丑便拿出自齐投奔秦武王的大勇士孟贲，来比拟孟子不动心的勇气。  曰：“不动心有道乎？”曰：“有。北宫黝之养勇也，不肤挠，不目逃;思以一毫挫于人，若挞之于市朝；不受于褐宽博，亦不受于万乘之君;视刺万乘之君，若刺褐夫，无严诸侯;恶声至，必反之。 “孟施舍之所养勇也，曰：‘视不胜，犹胜也。量敌而后进，虑胜而后会，是畏三军者也。舍岂能为必胜哉？能无惧而已矣。’” 在孟子说了告子比他更早就不动心以后，公孙丑又问孟子，处于外界的诱惑下而能不动心，有没有什么方法？孟子说，有啊！于是他举出两个古人为例，说出不动心的道理来。而这一番道理，从表面上看，似乎和“不动心”毫不相干，因为只是一些打拳练武的事。实际上看懂了以后，就知道他讲的是武士精神，要有这种快刀斩乱麻一般的武士精神，才能有不动心的勇气和定力。无论入世、出世的修养之学，对此都必须郑重注意。  孟子说：像北宫黝，在修炼自己武功的时候，要先养成“不肤挠，不目逃”的功夫。  所谓“不肤挠”，就是遇到可怕的事不会紧张得毛孔收缩，汗毛一根根竖起来。现代常形容为“刀架在脖子上，连眉毛也不皱一下”。“目逃”，在女性方面最常看见，小姐们看到—只小老鼠，尖叫一声，双手把眼睛遮起来，这就是目逃。过去练武功的人先练眼睛，用竹签、筷子在眼前晃动，好像要刺向眼睛，而眼睛不动；再进一步，用水泼向眼睛，眼睛是张开的，尽管水泼到了眼球上，眼球还是不动，连眼睑也不眨动一下，眼神就定住了。  北宫黝便练就武功上这么一个定力。至于在心理上，别人即使损害了他一根汗毛，在他的观念里，就像在闹区或在公堂之中当众打他一样的严重。而对于这种外来的打击，不管对方是普通老百姓，或者是高高在上的大国君主，他同样的不能够忍受，一定要反击，非把这口气争回来不可。当他要去攻击别人的时候，也是这种心理，即使去杀一个有万乘战车的大国国君，在他来说，和在街上杀一个小瘪三一样，并不因对象是一个国君就会恐惧、顾忌或犹豫，他要动手就动手。所以他对于各国的诸侯并不放在心上，天大地大不如我大，算是天地间唯我独尊的人。谁对他说话声音大一点，他一定比你的声音更大，更凶狠。这是一种勇，横而狠的勇，也是任侠尚气、好勇斗狠的勇。  孟子再举例说了另一个养勇的人——孟施舍，他的勇是另一型的。北宫黝的勇，是大洪拳、螳螂拳，相当于近代武侠电影明星李小龙，是精武门这一路上的；相反的，孟施舍则属于太极门，是柔道绵功型的。  孟子说：孟施舍培养勇的功夫则有所不同。外表看起来，他似乎是一个文弱书生，好像对方用指头一点，就会使他倒下去似的。可是真地打起来，他也非常认真，非常谨慎，先估计对方的力量，然后再考虑自己用什么方法，在什么时候进击对方的要害。等到考虑周密，在心理上认为有绝对战胜的把握时，这才和对方交手。这是先顾虑到对手比自己强大的一种作战态度，并不是说我是天下无敌的，一定能够打胜。虽然他随时惧敌，但却具备了不惧怕强敌的勇气。凭了这份勇气，再运用智慧坚强自己的信心，以弱敌强，打败比自己更强大的敌人。  所以武功虽是小道，但是武勇的修养却很不简单。表面上看，孟施舍的胆子小得很，不轻易和人家动手，实际上他的气魄已经修养到心理上不怕任何人。他的智慧已战胜敌人，而态度上还是绝对的谨慎，这是孟施舍和北宫黝两种不同的养勇典型。  说到“不肤挠，不目逃”，我们可以了解，孟子之所以举这两个人的养勇来答复公孙丑，是从外在不动心的修养方面作个说明；也就是告诉公孙丑，对于外在的不动心，起码要修养到所谓“泰山崩于前而色不变,麋鹿兴于左而目不瞬”的程度。这样的修养，的确很难做到。——《孟子与公孙丑》
Damn he ripped it

I like your solos and collaborations  Your definitely moving the needle in the music industry your flow and word play is so good no matter the topic
Remix of AC/DC "Back in Black"  the industry is demonic and this flow is unattainable.  Joyner working with the higher ups. They give all the fame and fortune to the willing partakers.
Shine on j
This is Joyner’s song now 😎
Back on the remix shit. My nigga🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
His remixes  make the original songs look boring
"When you gon make  new music wit Marshall?" - That's a question though🤔 yes it is

If you confess Jesus as Lord and believe He was raised from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9

I only listened to it once so I might be wrong but it sounds like he’s venting against normal dudes who can’t afford what he has. Like why do they bother him lol
I'm honored to hear. I wonder if Joyner reads his comments . I got mad love for this nigga. Keep up nigga LETS GO!!!!!!!!!!!

Does Joyner put any of his remix in Spotify ?
REMIXES BE BACK
Not hatin but has done better, he sounds like he forcing it to match the beat, im a fan and I call it like I see it.....Joyner still 🔥🔥🔥🤌🏽🥲
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.

I'm just really being honest y'all I'm just sick of being modest all the time When all these artists talk like they the hottest and y'all They don't get away with murder They just rhyming words together, ain't no substance to their monologue They go on stage and spray the crowd with water Rapping over top they vocals to this track In fact, they sounding awful dog  -Rittz
I pay a stripper crypto 😂😂😂😂😂

These freestyles is the only the thing we got in the rap game FRFRFRFR🔥🔥🔥🔥
Joyner fires shots as soon as he ‘hops in’ the studio 🔥 😳 💨 💀 ☠️ 🎯 🔥 💣 🤯
I don't know a lot, but I do know that whoever's song that was, it's not theirs any more.

Joyner is what tupac would have wanted hip hop to turn into. Tupac said raps gonna get soft if we don't talk about what we really want, its gonna get soft if we rap about partying and screwing around. Hip hop used to go after the government it was the voice of the people.
Yes bro killed it 💯👊🏻🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
oh yeah.................... had to.....................
Hmmm I don't know what he talking about sometimes
La bestia 🔥 🔥 🔥
everyone saying Joyner like they forgot how to spell goat.
I'm playing this loud in my car killing the block
U needa hop on the beat box
Did he say 2z or toosie
this shit harder then the official
🔥🔥🔥
Yes Joyner back with another sick remix 🔥🙏🔥
This man is a genius who else been seeing him share and react and comment all over social media today 👨🏽‍💻💯🥀🥀
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Damn on it 🔥🔥

Joyner always drop remixes that make the original look generic
Couldn’t stop thinking what did he smell to make him look like that
The flow at 1:57 gets off beat and kinda choppy

Let’s gooooooo !!! 🔥🔥🔥
This is fire.
Another H-Bomb!
This man is honestly one of the best artist in probably a decade. Great original and remixed work every song. I would say this could have been more “aggressive” I don’t understand why though that he went from talking about how he doesn’t do drugs but then on this talks about trapping. Maybe I’m missing something, if anyone knows, please let me know.
This nigga in my top 5 it’s the bars for me 💯💪🏽
Joyner i thought u was a thug🥶💦
If Joyner remix your song it’s his now 🤷‍♂️
SHEESH!
I like it, but it's not his best freestyle...
Man i miss joyner with no autotune. Don't get me wrong I like most of Joyner's ADHD songs but his 508 album is Fire!!!!    Love the Remix Joyner
Always wondered how this beat would sound with bars in it. Thanks Joyner.
Joyner always make other people's songs sound way better when he remix it

Joyner needs to do a beatbox remix now like he did the panda remix JOYNER BURY THE BEATBOX
And they have the nerve to say he’s not the best rapper of this generation foh
Under Rated!!! #wordsmith
🗑
Joyner n Marshall 💯💥💥
🎧💀🎧🔥🔥🔥🔥⚡⚡
Quem está vendo de um país que fala português... like here
shit weak
Straight fire. 🔥 🔥🔥
I like Joyner he has bars but this wasn't it for me
Good bars, but the flow wasn’t quite where it usually is
At this point, rappers who get remixed by Joyner must flip out like artists do when they get parodied by Weird Al.
Bro delete this and try again.
Straight Joyner 🔥🔥🔥
you owe us WAP remix
omggggggggggggggggg yesssss
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thumbs up as soon as I heard “Joyner,Joyner,Joyner”
We back j lets go brother💪🏼💯
You could use the Ocean, & you still wouldn't put this 🔥 out! Dats Tuff!
First of all, song is dope af.   Second, as a tech/vfx artist the blood "splash" bugs me so much haha. It's clearly a water sim rendered out red. Blood has much more viscosity and wouldn't jump as much on impact.
Hey joyner can u plz do a beatbox remix😄
A legend in the making! He put out NOTHING BUT 🔥 Joyner is a monster
shit is crazy
Yuk Joyner, leave the street bangers for the streets son, this is embarrassing to the original

People really do feel some type of way when rappers show versatility & drop some mainstream music lmao like damn people can’t make music about having fun every now & then?
💯
It’s dope but I feel like the production is real lazy
This shit so bad
Never disappoints🔥

[Intro] Ayy, ayy Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Ayy, Joyner, Joyner, Joyner Yeah, look (Ayy)  [Verse] I ain't been on my freestyle shit in a minute but niggas don't put no respect So tell all these rappers that I'm takin' over, just so you know what to expect I wasn't gon' do it at first but fuck it, I must keep my foot on they neck If I give you a warning, you better believe me, you know I stay good on my threats Nigga, I spent my whole life in the studio, shit kinda feel like I'm doin' a stretch I wish I could spend more time with my son but I know that I'm doin' the best And I know that it's worth it when he look at mе and say, "Daddy, look, you are the best" Need to find a nеw way to deal with my anger 'cause I never do good with stress Niggas hate when I brag, I know, when I talk about cash, I know When I talk about cars, I know, all the bitches I have, I know They say, "J, I miss when you was broke Way before all the fame and glory Money changed you, it made you corny The material things just bore me You're no different than all of these industry niggas, I thought you were special and awesome Now you sellin' your soul and just hopin' on records with anyone, nigga, you lost it I miss when you made music that I could relate to 'cause all of your new shit ain't thoughtful When you gon' make some new music with Marshall? When you gon' pull some new shit out the arsenal?" I'm back on my remix shit, don't sue me, nigga, I'm too unruly I might slide on a hoe like Toosie, bitch, I'm too dang groovy, ooh Niggas try and cancel me like Boosie, all y'all hoes is goofy But, yeah, you know my life's a movie, I sold crack to Pookie Look, she in love with the cocaine, I'm in love with the dope gang Try to cook crack with a oven and propane Try to make a dollar back when I ain't have no name But niggas told me that I had to stay in my own lane I jumped in the water and started makin' my own wave I'm watchin' the pool splash, they told me don't move fast And every nigga doin' better than me, I blew past Now niggas look at me, like, "How the fuck did he do that?" I got one crib, I don't live in it The other one is big enough to probably put my other muhfuckin' crib in it But one crib, I made a clubhouse and stuffed all my step kids in it And then I built me a trap house and let all the fiends take a hit in it And I might buy a church too, just in case I wanna sin it Put a hot tub in the front row, let all my hoes come swim in it Yeah, I made so much bread, I bought a crib to take a shit in it You talk about it, I'm livin' it, you brag about it, I been did it And I got your bitch in the whip ridin' shotgun with the ceiling down You let her down, I feel her up just 'cause the bitch feelin' down I don't know if her ass real but I do know that it's really round I think that I'm tall enough for her to give me head without kneelin' down Fake niggas only really lie just because of prolly how real it sounds Please shut the fuck up anytime I bring somebody real around You versus me, nigga? That's like a whale pushin' a seal around Tell me, how many dead rappers you think it takes to fill the ground? And bitch, I'm in pimp mode, I only know what the pimps know The man in the mirror is schizo, I pay a stripper in crypto I pay a stripper in crypto, I do not care if you lit, though I hit my plug from the flip phone, I'm sellin' pebbles to Flinstones Scam nightly, sellin' whatever the strand might be, yeah Get like me, all of my packages sealed tightly, yeah I had a record deal, then I drop a label, nigga, come take a chance like me You niggas cannot advance like me, you'll give Atlantic back the advance like me I got the upper hand, mm, and I got the other hand icy My diamonds movin' like Chris Brown, you know I love when they dance hyphy Ayy, ayy, only nigga that told his girlfriends 'bout my other girlfriends in front of my side lil' bitch and wifey Give a fuck about security in the club, we gon' ride Give a fuck if it's a quarantine or not, we still outside The last nigga tried to play me talkin' crazy, then he died Like them cheap-ass hoes [?], catch you slippin', we gon' slide Ooh, ooh, catch you slippin', we gon' slide Put that rubber on that grip, then we gon' cut your ass outside Send 'em goonies on that mission, it go trip and you gon' hide When you get hit that blicky you gon' wish that you done died [Outro] Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, Joyner Ayy, ayy
Ooooooh God damn 🤬🤬🤬 this is too lit damn
How do y’all still listen to this lyrical rap. The original doesn’t even sound like this. Get onto some real shit like Jay Critch, Ardee, King Von, or Tyfontaine. This actually sounds like 2009. I can’t with it. Same song everytime. Sounds like Im at my little brothers basketball game.
“Yall sayin my new stuff ain’t thoughtful and is corny”  *proceeds to be corny*
So bumping sold crack to Pookie
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Absolute Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
If Joyner does a remix of your song, it isn’t your song anymore
This Shit slaps ❌🧢
I need a Joyner X Token collab. Shit would be unbelievable.
I know the beat gone got murdered
Smells like legend
This brings me back to the Panda and Mask Off remixes

Joyner sliding yet again
You have to appreciate it while it last, Joyner is at his peak and destroying beats on the regular 😤😤😤😤🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssshhhhhhhh

Knowing how LYRICALLY ILL Joyner gets on freestyles, this was mid to me (by HIS standards)
people who like joyner are the same people who clean they shoes with they tooth brush and brush they teeth right after
Still wonder why he is underrated!!
Can't wait for @nolifeshaq to react to this ☺
The REMIX KING is back!🙏🏻🔥
this shit so wack
🤣🤣🔥
Joyner, this fire!
I thought it was joe budden in the background
🙏✌💜🌞🦋 🤣🤣🤣 while your words explain my add/inner voices 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Joyner your flows are goated
You a bum. What happened to Wap?
I never heard him make a bad remix 🔥
Honestly this is mid.. joyner coulda came way harder some bars hit & were slick but outta his remixes this the worst one 💯 its still good just aint on par with how he usually spits.
Always impressed with your music and remixes, stay slappin 🙌
He low key just needs to stop rapping lmao
Joyner back on those rappers
yo joyner with another one but when we gonna get that i be good regardless track you played at the last FV tour still waiting for that fucking banger to play it on repeat please drop that one the people need it

JOYYYYYNNNNEEERRR🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amazing 👏 good shit
Oooooof, baby we back
The bar that i thought sounded hard was "me vs you its like a whale pushing a seal"🔥🔥🔥
I actually needed this...🔥
My idol I respect bro 🙏❤️🇹🇭
It's... okay. A lot of the bars are just all over the place, with very few sounding at least good. He rapped about how people call his lyrics empty and lacking that strong messaging he used to do back when he didn't have all this crazy money, then proceeds to rap about the very things people complain about in a boring, not all that engaging way. Kinda meh to me honestly, definitely not gonna replay it for the bars. 5/10.
"Give a fuck if it's a quartine or not, we still outside"❄❄
Sorry Pooh Sheisty...this Joyner's track now
Please sir don’t stop
He just said he missed free styling and now 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
#1. 2021 represent hard  🎤😁❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸😎🍻
Pay a stripper in Crytpo?!? 🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂
This is FUCKING FIRE!! So underrated and comes just to prove a point🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤟🏾
“I think I’m tall enough for her to give me head without kneeling down”🤔 Joyner is 6’1” Which means his waist is around 3 feet off the ground The average adult dwarf is 4’0”... .................😨
Man your remix is better then original song.
This man NEVER MISSES 🐐🔥
He don’t miss it’s crazy
🔥🔥🔥
I loved it, but I can’t be the only one who doesn’t hear as much hunger right?
Ayyyyeeee
What a fucking legend man this was absolute fire man
Joyner high key the best rapper right now
The only problem with this remix is that it's definitely better than the original song!!
Who’s song is this originally? Fire af as always, Joyner! 👀🔥
I find it funny that the more rappers have money, the more they brag about paying for sex XD
Joyner!!!🤩🤑🔥
Joyner this is fire🔥🔥🔥
Something about Joyner freestyling just hits different 🔥🔥

"I pay a stripper in Crypto'
bro this is the song of the year no cap , shit is pure fire wtf
Joyner your to much bro 🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I pay a stripper in crypto....🐕 dog haha
Ong you snapped 💯💯 🔥🔥
Love this guy
I have never heard a bad Joyner Lucas song ever . He's definitely one of my favorite rappers
Joyner is underrated ❌🧢
🔥 🔥 🔥 this shit slaps 🙌🖤
I clicked on this as soon as I seen it omg
There is not a single track that Joyner has wasted.
Your remixes are normally better than the original.  This one isn't. If you want to bring the old Joyner  freestyle shit back you got to bring the intensity and the hunger with it.  That's what we relate too.  This sounds forced we can't feel it in your voice no more.
Wooooooweeeee get em big 🐕
Where’s the beatbox
Yessssss Joynerrrr!!!!! Been waiting for these ❤️
Been waiting for this...
* dusting off my Joyner Lucas remix playlist *
His songs go hard but his remixes are just different bro 🔥
Slight heat
It doesn’t matter what song it is if Joyner on it it’s ten times better
Who said this man sold out cuz their eyes and ears need checked!?
Flow is tight but this beat is as weak as they come.
That's steps above  remixing Lil Pump considering the original Is already really fucking good, BUT YOU NAILED THAT SHIT
I expected more from Joyner. This is honestly the weakest remix to the song I have heard yet. Then you got the dumbasses in the comments acting like this is the hardest thing Joyner has dropped in reality it’s one of the weakest. Sorry Brody but this one ain’t it and I was definitely expecting more out of you on this.
Tbh....not my favorite remix. Some of the lyrics didnt rly make sense. Not like I can do better tho 🤷‍♂️
Name something impossible: Joyner making a bad song
Thank you Joyner 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 the game needs this shit
🥵🔥🥵🔥🥵
Walmart drake 😬
We need a Joyner Lucas and Kevin gates song like if you agree
Joyner's freestyle return🔥🔥🔥🔥
Please go outside Eminem. You’re above him now.
Joyner!!!!
I can’t believe I turned into one of those “I see Joyner, I click” type of people 🤦🏾‍♂️ 😂🔥🔥🔥
Nice, another remix.
It’s good but he could’ve went harder
Best remix I heard nbs
It’s aslab
LEGEND
VAAAMOS I LOVE THIS
Joyner joiner mad love from nz
Never fails to show he's the best 👌🔥
The fast verse came very unexpected.
Yo I’m gonna remix your remix like i been doing
I literally was just thinking how we would never get another remix from him because hes got that hype now. Im glad I was proven wrong. Total heat cant wait for more
Better than the original.
I knew what it was going to sound like before even clicking play. Joyner is badass but he kinda has a predictable flow and tone.
So far Joyner its too classic 🔥
Best freestyle.
He's back!!!!!
YAAAAS bring da remixes back 👏🏼👏🏼
When this going on Spotify?
Lyrics : [Intro] Ayy, ayy Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Ayy, Joyner, Joyner, Joyner Yeah, look (Ayy)  [Verse] I ain't been on my freestyle shit in a minute but niggas don't put no respect So tell all these rappers that I'm takin' over, just so you know what to expect I wasn't gon' do it at first but fuck it, I must keep my foot on they neck If I give you a warning, you better believe me, you know I stay good on my threats Nigga, I spent my whole life in the studio, shit kinda feel like I'm doin' a stretch I wish I could spend more time with my son but I know that I'm doin' the best And I know that it's worth it when he look at mе and say, "Daddy, look, you are the best" Need to find a nеw way to deal with my anger 'cause I never do good with stress Niggas hate when I brag, I know, when I talk about cash, I know When I talk about cars, I know, all the bitches I have, I know They say, "J, I miss when you was broke Way before all the fame and glory Money changed you, it made you corny The material things just bore me You're no different than all of these industry niggas, I thought you were special and awesome Now you sellin' your soul and just hopin' on records with anyone, nigga, you lost it I miss when you made music that I could relate to 'cause all of your new shit ain't thoughtful When you gon' make some new music with Marshall? When you gon' pull some new shit out the arsenal?" I'm back on my remix shit, don't sue me, nigga, I'm too unruly I might slide on a hoe like Toosie, bitch, I'm too dang groovy, ooh Niggas try and cancel me like Boosie, all y'all hoes is goofy But, yeah, you know my life's a movie, I sold crack to Pookie Look, she in love with the cocaine, I'm in love with the dope gang Try to cook crack with a oven and propane Try to make a dollar back when I ain't have no name But niggas told me that I had to stay in my own lane I jumped in the water and started makin' my own wave I'm watchin' the pool splash, they told me don't move fast And every nigga doin' better than me, I blew past Now niggas look at me, like, "How the fuck did he do that?" I got one crib, I don't live in it The other one is big enough to probably put my other muhfuckin' crib in it But one crib, I made a clubhouse and stuffed all my step kids in it And then I built me a trap house and let all the fiends take a hit in it And I might buy a church too, just in case I wanna sin it Put a hot tub in the front row, let all my hoes come swim in it Yeah, I made so much bread, I bought a crib to take a shit in it You talk about it, I'm livin' it, you brag about it, I been did it And I got your bitch in the whip ridin' shotgun with the ceiling down You let her down, I feel her up just 'cause the bitch feelin' down I don't know if her ass real but I do know that it's really round I think that I'm tall enough for her to give me head without kneelin' down Fake niggas only really lie just because of prolly how real it sounds Please shut the fuck up anytime I bring somebody real around You versus me, nigga? That's like a whale pushin' a seal around Tell me, how many dead rappers you think it takes to fill the ground? And bitch, I'm in pimp mode, I only know what the pimps know The man in the mirror is schizo, I pay a stripper in crypto I pay a stripper in crypto, I do not care if you lit, though I hit my plug from the flip phone, I'm sellin' pebbles to Flinstones Scam nightly, sellin' whatever the strand might be, yeah Get like me, all of my packages sealed tightly, yeah I had a record deal, then I drop a label, nigga, come take a chance like me You niggas cannot advance like me, you'll give Atlantic back the advance like me I got the upper hand, mm, and I got the other hand icy My diamonds movin' like Chris Brown, you know I love when they dance hyphy Ayy, ayy, only nigga that told his girlfriends 'bout my other girlfriends in front of my side lil' bitch and wifey Give a fuck about security in the club, we gon' ride Give a fuck if it's a quarantine or not, we still outside The last nigga tried to play me talkin' crazy, then he died Like them cheap-ass hoes [?], catch you slippin', we gon' slide Ooh, ooh, catch you slippin', we gon' slide Put that rubber on that grip, then we gon' cut your ass outside Send 'em goonies on that mission, it go trip and you gon' hide When you get hit that blicky you gon' wish that you done died [Outro] Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, Joyner Ayy, ayy

"I pay a stripper in crypto" ⛽🔥
I am one of the people Joyner is talking about who haven’t liked his stuff lately but this is kind of nice. Hell yeah Joyner
Gotta remix gang gang with lil Wayne.That beat is too good and wasn’t given justice. I know Joyner would demolish it!
The Em shoutout 🔥🔥🔥
THE REMIXES ARE BACK YESSIR 🙌 🔥
Ian even pressed play and I know he murder the beat
Oh we back?
The Remix King💯🤝
This dude got real boring
When Joyner on the beat it’s his best now
GODAMNNNNNNNNN JOYNER......HARDEST TRACK I HEARD ALL OF 2021......🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Shit smacks
I went on the original official video of back in blood and said joyner murdered this beat and now lil durk fans hatin!
“ I Pay a Stripper in Crypto “ 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
Pooh can't take his beat back in blood this time!
Death is certain life is not, Speak from your stomach and follow your gut,  I Got my word, my brain, my nuts, An I speak for my people in God I trust, From the land of living skies.. so cold that you'll freeze halfway through a rhyme,  slowing time down fast running laps inside, My mind and I cant escape I don't know why, Can you tell me why?
&uc$
Joyner please do a remix on that Beatbox beat!!!
Always heat never sleep Joyner you should make a mixtape called the remix and slaughter all competition....I'd buy it in a heartbeat
Yo!!! This was fucking hard! And mean ! Damnnn. Ima buy a church just to sin in it . I’m tall enough to have her sick my sick standing up ! Like so many more g!
when i saw this i said uh oh
Joyner I’m appreciative of the inspiration you give me for my own journey 🔥💯 your 🐐status
I would remix a Joyner Lucas song if I could rap. I just got texted back from Dax. I'm too broke to buy a car so I ride the Trax. But I'll hop up on this track and spit some facts. Back in Blood. Like  Amy Winehouse we finna go back to black. And I be spitting fiery verses back to back. I spit verses in the hall with Chris Brown from wall to wall. Rapping at the mall. Where you can bet it's going down like Yung Joc said. Yo girl just called me. She works at Aldi's. She said she wants all the D. I give her quality. Because I'm ballin. We fly like Jim Jones. Not the cult leader. But I might just lead a cult with my Colt drinking Colt 45. Knock knock who's there? It's my whole gang outside. I ain't playing no games but you better hide because we gonna seek you. My dick's a heat seeking missile. Got her squealing in the sheets like a whistle. This ain't no fat or gristle. I'm rapping straight meat. Packing heat to the beat like a thermos. Y'all some vermin. Better get to learnin. Before you get a 4th degree burning. Back in Blood.
Remix's are Joyner's forte
I want a Tyler herro remix Joyner do it plz
“You vs me that’s like a whale pushing a seal around” 🔥🔥
I love you Joyner!!! You never disappoint.
He never miss
He doesn’t miss
Here before 200K. Joyner for the win AGAIN
Yeeyee

⚡
The Armageddon of remix is back
Joyner never disappoint his fans, always makin’ em proud to be one🔥🔥🔥
💥 🔥🔥
How is Joyner copying other people’s homework and still getting a better grade
Joyner joyner joyner💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥
This flow and where he's sitting on the beat really reminds me of Royce, dope shit
underrated
The realist rapper out there today💯Joyners a reminder that real hip hop will live on.. So tired of these other posers

Ok my nigga a mc but still remixing dammm🔥🔥🔥

WELL WELL WELL(Birdman rubbing hands 👏🏾)
Was expecting more rapid fire flow but this is good, nice to see Joyner enjoying himself
A Joyner Lucas Twitch Hot Tub stream with a bunch of baddies running around will probably break the viewership record
The evolution from “I’m sorry” to “I’m not racist” to this???? Joyner really can do anything, mans a legend in the making.
Gettttttttt Ittttttttttt Fireeeeeeee
joyner remixes never miss
Needed this shit
Who else loves joyners remixes?🔥
This is his song now
🔥🔥🔥
One thing i can say about Joyner is that he seems to keep getting better. Every new project and single is better than the last.

I wish this remix was better. Joyner is one of my favorite rappers but this is a dissapoint in my opinion. I want to hear bars that makes my spine and skin crawl, not hear how much money you have.

There ain't many good lyricists in hip-hop nowadays except for Eminem, Joyner Lucas, Nas, Jay-Z, A$AP Rocky, Joey Bada$$, Kendrick Lamar, The Game, J Cole and a few others but real hip-hop is hard to come by and that's for real
🙏🏽💯👑

These remixes never disappoint !!!!!!!!

This redeemed joyner for me

Remixkiller 💯🔥
I like the video and a song 👍
Im just a rapper inspired by guy like Joyner. I remember listening to him years ago when he made that Ross song and it was amazing. I remember him saying he wanted to give up because he was almost 30 and making some depressing music but im glad to see where he is now. Gives me inspiration to never give up. If you mess with real hip hop please search yannickmakesmusic Black Male and show some love.
Yawn
My guy said I pay a stripper in crypto 🤦🏾‍♂️🔥🔥🔥
Finna make me act up
Fucking goat.

Been waiting on the remixes
Heard his first line and already knew this was going to be fire!!!
I feel like Joyner has been more playful with the flow and the delivery back then. Now, it's predictable and identical. Although he will drop some songs here and there that remind me of the old Joyner.
Always fire
Honestly the way things were going lately, the only freestyle I expected was maybe a beatbox freestyle lmao
I was here before million views👍
