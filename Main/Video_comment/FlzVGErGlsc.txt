2:59 same w me
I wouldn't have refused the kiss, she's better than me 😂 😂😂
He gives me major Sheldon vibes 😭😭
The smallest man who ever lived
re-watching this again, my gosh they are so cute. low key they are roasting each other lol.  As a low iron woman, agrees that our hands are usually ice-cold haha.
she's an idiot
He's funnier than she is.
WHY IS THIS CONVERSATION SO AWKWARD?! I LOVE IT
Taylor Swift dated this man?
Dressed in his jehovas witness suit , smallest man in the world   Not even an interesting conversationalist .. how could anyone find this attractive 🤮
He’s blah 😑 lol - I think Taylor Swift really liked him for so many years. I don’t get it but love doesn’t make sense. I’ve also been infatuated with people that I shouldn’t be, and who aren’t a good fit.
Classic Matty needing to over intellectualise everything
Waiting for women to come forward telling their MeToo stories about Matty Healy.
Am I the only one weirded out wth why was bro pressuring her ahaha (ik its planned but its so uncomfortable to watchhh)
“I have low i-on”
Omg this guy is the only one who’s more sarcastic and clingy than Amelia herself
Amelia: “You’ve always been a genius, would you say?” Matty: “I wouldn’t call myself a genius-“ Amelia: “You just did.” Matty: “Well, I described my… so, yeah, I’ve always been a genius.” Amelia: 🙂  This dialogue was simply genius. 😂
I love his humor I can see why Taylor liked him 🫶🔥
He likes hot girls. While he looks like that
Why is he wearing a Jehovas witness suit
Amelia with the great inside joke from The 1975 song: “You were coming across as clever, then you lit the wrong end of your cigarette” ❤
I'm in love with both of then
I’ve seen this so many times, and I always come back for more. 😅 I love Matty!! They could never make me hate himmmmm 🖤
I just can't find this funny 😔
THE YOUTUBE ALGORITHM IS DOING THE TAYLOR CHARLI BEEF DIRTY OMG!!!
Thank you for this!!! Such pure and good entertainment….
🏆💯👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏✨Greeeeeeat!!!!
He hates her and it's obvious
Why does this feel like watching toddlers talk about grownup stuff?
Absolutely love him and Taylor too but I hope his wife is a nice one, slightly worried to be honest. 😂
I still come back and its the same thing except I learn a new kind of roast from this two I use to people who annoys me
Wtaf is this 😂😂😂
"beach ball" hahahahh
squirm
Hes an unlikeable character
he funny
I'm the same way as him like I have a pretty face, fit body and I'm talented but my personality is dog shit 😂
I understand what they are saying but they live in a completely different universe than me (I'm Canadian)
The kisss😂😂 it pathetic😂😂😂
Low ion😂🤣🤣👍 why dont you buy me some ion supplements  Girls we are surviving on supplements❤😂
The Gitarre bit😂🤣🤣🤣👍   My personali'y  haha
FUCCCKKKKK YOU DONT SAY NO  TO MATYYYY  HUHU
This is THE best episode
I used to really like him, but now he’s so far up himself that it’s boring
that man is chronically online just like the rest of us dkjfhskdjfh
Am melia
That was the most awkward and worse date I watched on this channel. Him insisting to kiss was so sus, I don’t know what you’re on people in the comment who through that was fine and fun and would have kissed him, like ew.
just discovered this and feel like i must've jumped timelines to not know about it already  real talk are any of the episodes funnier than this one?  edit: ok i'm back after watching a fuckton of these yes this is the funniest one
This is my fave
Hilarious😂
He met her match. For sure
It was kinda giving siblings over dating ahah
7:46 no means no matty
The smallest man who ever lived
This is so wattpad coded. Awkward goody two shoes girl being pursued by the dark artistic broody guy
He seems so off-putting and self centered. Am I missing something? He's not super attractive to me either, but it always seems to be about him. Idk. I'll never get a chance with him anyways but I don't find him attractive after this.
yep matty is in the top ten. you did ask for my fave'z the last time we met at the R.A.C. im just formulating the top ten now. D
WHAT ON EARTH was Taylor thinking - the man needs a SCRUB!
i feel like matty healy is so used to all girls liking him, that he isnt used to a girl not liking him and just pretending for a joke. she teases him about things and it makes him feel seen in a way he isnt seen by other girls. he genuinely wanted her for a sec, that explains the kiss moment. also amelia is so strong for refusing that one because i can imagine another girl feeling like she cant say no.  did i analyse that right?
“Why don’t you buy me some iron supplements” is a wild flirting line
Where was this in the timeline of him dating Taylor and them breaking up? Just out of curiosity
"young and relevant"
This is my favorite one
So he really IS the smallest man who ever lived
smallest man who ever lived for real
All I see is his dad 😂
7:00 i laughed out loud
this guys resting face just cracks me tf up he looks like the protag of a comic strip about the tedium of modern life
He is so funny & hot too ❤❤❤
I got so many icks in these few minutes
Special biriyani at 2:57  Biriyani at a fried chicken shop?😭
he is all the grossest men combined
7:02 😂this is a lesson for u
1:44 😍
He's so likeable. I'm surprised 😂
Constantly perplexed how people find this dude attractive. Let's ignore the awful personality but appearance wise ...ew? He just looks unwashed and sleazy
7:24 if anyone is looking for the near kiss
he looks like he has a deep sadness in him
Matty Healy is like a character from a sitcom. I genuinely can’t tell if it’s an act or if he’s actually like that…
The whole genius section where Amelia is trying not to laugh had me on the floor
that was so funny also random  0:36
Amelia is amazing lol
He's so funny off stage. Lol. One of my fave c.s.d s
The black n white was a nice touch
It's the most mutual slapstick conversation match she's done
Amelia: You're an aries  Matty: Oh god...  Yeah, I feel you, Matty, we've all been there.
im blushing AND EVEN SHARED A CIGARETTE TS INTIMATE ASF
Matt Healy has a real "wow you're not like other girls, you can actually keep up" vibe to him
3:36 ‘You’re an Aries’ ‘Gawd!’
The kissing demand was coercion! 😮
This is the best one, so British. And i feel it's so her vision.
I watched this and I was expecting to be cringed by him or something but he's actually hilarious I get it now
Omg these two had chemistry 😂
Sorry but can't believe Taylor ever dated him. Just not her vibe.
This is the most accurate portrayal of what I’d imagine it’d be like to date a vampire.
Like Hot Ones,  she's already had just about everyone on an episode, except Taylor Swift.  When is Taylor going to go on a chicken date?
he looks like he smells of spoilt yogurt on a hot day
Someone tell me what Taylor saw in this man?
Apparently the bloke is a pathetic, spoilt, middle class cretin.😮Just saying. Guinness for Iron😅
Perfect match right there, won't ever see a better one 😅!
I guess someone has to write the fanfic.
04:00 re the song lyric, 'I'm in love with you'. Firstly, it's wonderfully complex how he delivers it in the song, and despite Amelia saying they are common words the only other song I could find having that actual line is a Dean Martin song from maybe 60 years ago. It's been hiding in plain sight all that time.
this whole thing was so uncomfortable my GOD
He's hilarious! Great date.
0:33 Love you Matty.♥️💕🥰
When she said 'your an aries' mattys face was so unbelievablely genuine
Oh. My. GOD!!!!! Now I want them to get married😭
I can't tell if he is rude or just very deadpan or if this is his sense of humor.
I'm so glad she pied him ❤😂
The amount of times I giggled before really getting into this is amazing 😆 just making him flustered lol
I'd take Loius Theroux any day
He shouted out NARDUAR!! A Canadian national treasure and icon
Nepo nickelback
Personality of mum. Looks of dad.
He’s a poundland popstar
Oh my god, I feel like you could see real fear of rejection on her face when he said to kiss and it made me feel a flash of empathic sadness! This episode was very engaging!
i realized that i only like his music
"i do, i actually do" he said that so sad
He looks like trigger off fools and horses
This is my favourite of her interviews. They have great banter.
low iron is a turn off … babes most women have low iron pls get a life. i h8 this man
In his Jehovah’ witness suit apparently 👀
Isn't that one of the Jonas Brothers? 😅
shouts matty tho
how does this one have a show shes severely unfunny
What did Taylor Swift ever see in this man
Beach Ball
Oh cool is that the girl from the somebody else video ?awesome
He's such an Aries 😂😂😂 so pissed 😂😂😂
Not the moleskine lmaoooooooo
Bruh that oil needs changing
He gets bad press, but is actually really cool 👍
i love him still lol
esse homem me da arrepios
He was genuinely flirting! Of course 💁🏻‍♀️
Why is he so cute? 😗
Hawt girls have smaller chests that are round and perky and best and most and most beautiful and elegant and attractive, not big monstrous sahgin hangin ones which are unappealing to all
This was by far the funniest video :D he passed the vibe for everyone.
Cold hands, warm heart
THE SMALLEST MAN WHO EVER LIVED!!!
I love this interview. Because they're both quite sarcastic and not remotely serious, yet so many people think he's serious here. LOL.
i do😔i actually do😔
“I was born in 1989”… sounds familiar (iykyk)
i HATE him
This is comedy gold 😂😂😂
u guys serious calling them a match she deffo hates him
He was funny AF in this. I get why TS liked him.
his personality is his worst trait. Female is his type, the drunker he is
Perfect match
Such a shame that people find vacuous narcissists like her amusing. No wonder society is collapsing,
RUN
He’s uncomfortable
I find him both repellent and hilarious. Her clever swerve with the forehead kiss made me split my sides open
best one, I thought i'd hate Matt Healy but he's great
I searched for Alex Turner have no idea why this gross rat comes up in search results
How she managed to turn down that kiss; superhuman. 😂
amelia dimoldenberg i was unaware of your game
"you dont need to do this" LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOO
it's basically like he really did invent tumblr and doc martens tbh
Matty ❤❤❤❤
hahaha 6:47 his expression is so funny!! Disappointment, frustration, wishing to escape but yet answering her question... all at once! :P
THE TENSIOOONNNNN
I can see the pain in Amelia's eyes when Matty force them to kiss 😭😭😭 that is so scary 😭  That moment is a text book red flag guy, for me 🚩
Bro is this the man Taylor Swift was crying over 😂😂😂😂   Come on now
Going in I knew this would make me uncomfortable because that man makes me feel very unwell but i like her. This did make me uncomfortable but seeing him struggle to figure it out made me happy. And her refusing the kiss despite him insisting and calling it pathetic made me even happier. I started watching this format with Andrew Garfield being a guest so maybe I'm spoiled.
Why do so many people like this? I've never seen her videos before and have only watched Harris Dickinson and Andrew Garfield and her chemistry with them is so much better. This feels like disdain.
Iron lmfao I love herrrr
Omg TTPD Omgggg
i LOVE him!!! I love the bits of humor together with his readiness to be vulnerable. Just an honest man.  Commit to the bit Amelia!!!   But also, sometimes I don’t think you’re looking for love. Cuz whenever you have the chance to be vulnerable or break the 4th wall, you run away.
The muse of the century
I see why Taylor Swift needed him
7:16 She gave a penalty kick to Matty Healy 😂
Don't do a podcast... This aged like fine wine
I'm here just because of kiss attempt.😬😂
the british humour in this is so fucking golden
This is the first time I’ve agreed with the whole British humor is more intellectual thing. Other times I found it just as based as American humor.
creepy ass guy
This got me giggling and wiggling my feet
i crave his vibe so bad
i actually cackled when he said slut era
Amelia predicting that podcast debacle is CRAZY. He should have listened!
"do you carry a moleskin around with you, you look like you would" - is hilarious
two decaf energies
Amelia has to be someone who would give the message to the smallest man who ever lived.
love the passive agreesiveness for the smalleat man who ever lived🤏🏻
What an annoying twat
Best one!
This is the guy Halsey wrote Colors,Ghost and Is There Somewhere? about and Taylor wrote the entire TTP album about...
the smallest man whoever lived
Oh my goodness. I don't get it, Taylor. He's abhorrent.
'i get it now' that was funnier than it should
7:48 wouldnt like to think what he is like after a few drinks wnd and there's no camera 😮
Que homenzinho chato
How does he sicken me and make me love him all at once?😭😭😭
This guy's so fucking boring
Beach balls...⛱️⚽️
“Why dont you buy me some iron supplements” 🤣
I’ve probably watched this at least 15 times. I’ll probably be back again in a few months. I’m a fan of The 1975 😊❤
did you actually go out with aitch was so real of him
No fucking way that’s the guy all those Taylor Swift songs are about?! I’m so confused
Did he just use the "s" word?? Seriously??
I LOVE HIMMMMM
why isn’t he an actor? he can do really good
He has the same violet chachki vibes
Everything was going smoothly until he made a move to kiss her. Her rejection bruised his ego.
She used to be so much better when she was more deadpan
~ In your Jehovah's Witness suit Who the f%-# was that guy? ~
Best date of them all!
"why don't you buy me some iron supplements" me flirting
This is the most British thing I’ve seen in a minute 😂
"Beach ball."
"or some gloves" 🤣
This one has been my favourite so far.
the funniest pop star interview i ever saw.. every inch of it... hilair.... brilliant.!! I watch this over and over....
8:00 “Those are fake cigarettes by the way. I thought I could get arrested or something for smoking inside!” 😂 I burst out laughing when Amelia said that.
Can u go on a date with Timothee Chalamatee
worst friend zone i've seen in my lifeee
this should be a lesson for you… doNT SMOKE
How on earth are people saying the date with Jack Harlow had the most chemistry when this video exists??? I mean they literally almost kissed 💀
2:25 🤣
Is he a kisser enthusiast or what? 7:26
'I WAS BORN IN 1989 AND I'M STILL RELEVANT' self affirmation i need
Smallest man
Like a sexier Nardwuar
7:05
The mutual satire was bang on here! 👏  Only true Brits will understand this one 😂
wow that was hard to watch at the end.
people in the comments not realizing this is a satire and that matty is just playing the character 😭
This is the best one of these I’ve ever seen. 😂 Matty is exceptional at playing this game.
This is the first time I’ve seen this guy…. I’ve heard his name a lot but I’m actually shocked…. This guy is NOT IT.
I love how antagonistic this is
This guy gives me unsafe man vibes, he’s creepy as f dunno my gut tells me he’s a wrongun
I get such strong narcissistic creep vibes from MH 🫣
Creepy guy
Well, this was interesting. 😂😂
“Right now” … “no” … “pathetic” … byeee creep
Is the guy being himself here?
I would not feel comfortable around him lmao
this is so damn hilarious
It was hard to watch 🚩
We need a second date with matty 🙏
He gave me the ick big big big time
Omg how am I just stumbling on this 😂😂 just watched it twice
I am coming here thousand times 😅
i can’t tell if it’s satire or not
I LOVE THIS I BEG YOU FOR ANOTHER DATE WITH MATTY
YALL NEED TO KISS FRFR
him insisting on kissing her seemed a bit predatory? Got a weird vibe
matty in 2023: “i’m straight”    matty in 2022: “i fell it love with a guy”
He’s chopped
Dear Lord, her acting skills were excellent up until the kiss part.  Her disgust was all over her face.  Pretentious was an understatement.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
A FOREHEAD KISS AMELIA?!
What a tosser
this is literally one of THE funniest chicken shop dates i've watched so far! he's such a needy deadinside idiot that even Amelia's dry disposition shines like she's some kind of pixie hahaha
The most overrated “hot guy” ever
His whole additute is so unsympathetic
NAD WUAR MENTIONED
holy crap I can't tell if he's genuinely this unlikeable or if it's a bit, or both
That “pathetic” he gave her after she refused to kiss him was such a 🚩
Pov:you came from the Harris Dickinson date 😭
The “maybe I am” Johnny cash reference
Honestly I hope you have a second date with him this was so funny
You’re in your slutty era. And then TTPD happened. I love you Matty, forever. 🖤
Anæmia Dimoldenberg Healy really has quite the ring to it 🤩
My fav❤
i couldn't tell you anything about Matty Healy before watching this video but omg the ending is so incredible i canNOT  i need more guests to ask for a kiss
I have never understood the appeal of him until just now. I have to assume it’s Amelia, but…he was really funny.
It's funny seeing Americans misunderstanding British humour and actually not liking Matty after this. News flash, this was comedy gold
hes weird
can we get this one erased pls
This was perfect 😂
7:46 AHHH
He called her bluff. Love it.😂
“just like Nardwuar”
Low iron That’s a turnoff.  lol.
im sorry but hes so 🤢
why was he actually flirting and feeling it 😂😂😂 he only got pissed when he found out the cigs were fake 😂😂😂
why is he mr bean if mr bean was alt
she's gods strongest soldier for saying no to him
He handles her the best for absolute sure.  Almost doesn’t clock the awkwardness and doesn’t seem to really care.
It's so weird. Love it ❤
"Did you actually go out with Aitch?" He asked. He was interested fr
OH MY FUCKING GOD. AMELIA.
Their ears match
I think this might be the funniest chicken shop date ever
it's so cringey😅also I can't tell if he's being FR or if it's a whole bit, I'm pretty certain her guests are being genuine so this one scares me
I would die it Matty leaned in to me for a kiss the way he did her
the smallest rat
I'm so happy you doged that kiss girl! He's an ass
My fav chicky shop epi. ever ❤❤❤
they actually had real chemistry
She smokes😭😭
U r what u did
So many one liners from this that I will use for an annoyingly long time. 😂❤
OR SOME GLOVES
One of the best, Matty is brilliant.
this is giving me sibling relationship-conversation vibes 😂
Amelia pretending to play guitar 🎸  😂😂
HOW COULD SHE REFUSE A KISS FROM MATTY HEALY??!!! GOD I HAVE SEEN WHAT YOU’VE DONE FOR OTHERS!
he’s really the smallest man who ever lived
Matt Healey has finally met his match!
He's a creep
He’s so ordinary and she nails it from the first second 😂
He really does dress in a Jehovah's witness suit
Hilarious 😂
I swear I searched and searched for what exactly Taylor found so intoxicating about Matty, but for the life of me, couldn't find ONE redeeming, charming quality. He's just...EW. The highest levels of cringe.
Just me that thinks he has predator vibes?
OMG ONE OF THE BEST EPISODES
omg i find him so unlovely. id bail and escape on a date with that kind of behavior
one of my faves, can't stop laughing
Fake cigarette cos you might get arrested is gold 😅😂
Taylor …
He appreciates her art
It's kind of a high compliment that Matty Healy wanted to have this experience with Amelia
That was actually very funny:)
annoying entitled self-proclaimed pushy idiot😂
lol she lights one one on a date i'm gonna stand up mid sentence and leave :D
“I’m an inna-vay-or.”
I love this series but dear God. DEAR GOD. He gives off some of the grossest vibes I've ever felt over a screen. And he's supposed to be on a cheeky flirty date?! My legs have never been harder crossed.
but like holy fuck matty healy is so fkn attractive, i cannot even---
Watching this now in 2024, with the knowledge I know now... well, Matty's behavior hits different. It was entertaining but I can't believe Amelia found someone with more deadpan delivery than her. And the way he just wants to kiss everyone and Amelia almost became another number. Yikes.
Idk why but i thought it was hilarious when he told her her having low iron was a turn off lmao
"why dont you buy me some iron supplements?" "..or some gloves?"  I love the interaction between these two🤣🤣
The way he leans in for the question, "Did you actually go out with Aitch?" 🤣🤣 Elbows and everything -
Fav date so far😂❤
No, THIS is the best Chicken Shop Date
Blink twice if you need help amelia
I've just recently discovered Amelia and these videos and they are giving me life today. 😂
this date was genuinely so funny LMAO and the ending is just the cherry on top 😭😭
Watching this after ttpd is interesting frrr
Ugh
This guy is into you 😅
So basically they are the same person
Damn these toxic swiftes here man
Nardwaur!  reference lol
this is absolutely most amazing Chicken Shop Date, their timing and vibe is incredible.
why you going up it lol
Am I the only one who doesn't get this show at all? Everything is just like... Why...? 😅😂
Wow he even licked his lips 😂😂😂😂AAAAAAAAH
I think I finally understand taylor’s obsession with matty
ppl actually think they have chemistry? matty seems very troubled. and he was real creepy at the end with the kiss
This was a funny one ❤
Everyone here who thinks his personality and face are charming .. you are all falling for the act that hes putting in plain sight for you.. 🤢 Ew and blind.
This has to be my favorite episode
I’m all glad we were here for his coming in party.
Matty is such a douche bag. 😂
Maybe I didn't understand the context completely, but him asking so many times if they could kiss and Amelia refusing every time and then he leaning on the table to get closer... I don't know, I felt a little uneasy... Hope it was all jokes...
The first sentence he said that he is straight 😂 which is weird
Hmmmmm, I like that he is also quirky and smart like she is.
he's so incredibly cold haha How is low iron a turnoff?
"or some gloves"...masterful.
“I’m straight” chloe or sam or sophia or marcus has entered the chat  taylor really just lays everyone’s business out in her songs huh 💀  (this is not a criticism lol)
This is very low energy for Matty.  Painful. (And yes, I know he was matching hers… still painful)
“You’re nervous”   “No, I’ve got low iron” 💀💀💀
YEAH HES STRAIGHT BUT CAME TO MALAYSIA AND KISS HIS BADMATE IS FUCKING HORRIBLE ATTITUDE WITH BIG DISRESPECT THIS ICKHEAD COMING TO OTHER PEOPLE COUNTRY AND DISRESPECT US LIKE THAT. NO MATTY UR NO MORE RELEVANT .
what did Taylor see in this man lol. genuinely asking.
matty healy has absolutely no charisma lol
I’m way behind, but I’m catching up. This is the funniest of her interviews that I’ve seen. They were perfect. And he made me laugh more than I expected. Bravo to both 👏👏
she touched mattyyyyyy😭😭😭😭
I don’t know who he is but he is so funny and adorable
You’re an Aries,.  oh god 😂😂😂😂
He looks like a white Damon Wayons 😂
she humbled him sm omg
he just looks really smelly
That was 😊 cute❤
“Or some gloves” killed me.
this is my absolute favvvv chicken shop date interview
I've always disapproved of cyber bullying but he makes me kind of understand it
Officially my fav date she’s had.
My absolute favorite ❤
I think I’ve fallen in love with this man now why is he so hot 🥲🥲
“Did you just try to touch me” 😂
The “you were actually flirting until you said you were in love” and “I get it now” parts always get me 🤣
As someone who was also born in 1989, can confirm I am still young and relevant. Definitely.
"Why don't you buy me some iron supplements?"  "Or how about some gloves?"   Hallmark can't even write lines this good. 👌🏼
7:00 sassy
The iron conversation 😂😂😂 Why is this so hilarious? Amelia was clearly nervous that the kiss was gonna happen.
People who don't appreciate Matty Healy's humor kinda don't get his sarcasm
Get the hair out of your eye!
This still tracks as my favorite of all dates ever.  'Your hands are cold you're nervous.' No, I have low iron. Why don't you buy me iron supplements. Classic Amelia snark. SNL could never.
This might be my favorite one
This is by far my favourite episode
I lowkey think she actually dislikes him and I love that
😆😆
hes awfull but kinda hot not gonna lie
I legitimately cackled at "You're an Aries"... "Oh, GAWD"
Why people are saying they have chemistry? I don't see it
looking like that at 30 is so unfortunate
Very uncool to put Amelia in that situation. I know exactly that feeling if somebody tries to cross your line and you dont  know how to say no because you don't know if its just fun and you dont wont to ruin it
We neeed a second date!! This was absolutely amazing 😂
2:53 the REAL band 🤣
😅 man pretends to be deep thinker but then says his number one priority in a woman is hotness😅
Love smile = 3:15
Peter pann small man P O Shiz😑
this is the dream you know....not necessarily a date with Matty Healy, but just knowing you've got him interested in you and then playing hard to get 😂
This episode was delicious. A mix between two ferns and the office
Oh no, ok Tay, I see it
I had to come back to the fact that the cig moment turns everything to black and white 😂
This guys marmite but pretty funny here. Atleast he leans into it.
Taylor whyyyy😢
한국 국기를 발로 밟은 몰상식한 사람과의 데이트 ㅋ  멍청하면 가만히 있어야 하는데 성격 또한 더러워서 자신이 한 행동에 대해 책임지지도 않고 도망가기 바쁜 겁쟁이 남자 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Well  This was uncomfortable
Ok. I now understand TTPD. All of it. They're both crazy. From first kiss to getting married. loml.  Smallest man who ever lived.
One of my favorite bands and I was born in 1965. :-) Pretty funny content.
This made me alive and tired at the same time
Racism is his worst trait lol
Dont like the part where he was forcing her to kiss.
"That's one of my special skills, *ahem*, that i can do." 👀
She missed the chance to say her favorite line was “the only time the feeling might get better is when we are together” and then Matty would say “I’m in love with you.” 😂 Would have been a perfect punch line.
Naahhh yall did not make the smoke bit black and white like that😂😂😂
Jeez he’s so unattractive. That hair 🤢 and looks like he’s smoking crystal meth!
I have a new respect for Healy after watching this.  He has a great self-aware humor.
Amelia is me if I had a date with Matty Healy. 😂😅
Hahahah I just laughed till death from this conversation 😂 Wake me up tomorrow
The smallest man who ever….
i’d want to rip out my eyes and eat them in front of him if i were on a date with him because good lord he is so insufferable
Love the johnny cash reference
Can somebody pls tell me what exactly this people doing?
the amount of times ive watched this is unhealthy ugh i just love them
one of the best videos on the internet
Gabriette now watching this 👁️👄👁️
His "eras" comment... when was this recorded???
what did he say at 0:15
Who's here after her post with his fiancé Gabbriette?
I can see TS watching this and rolling her eyes so hard 👀
No I’m not nervous I just have low iron 🤣🤣🤣
he's so creepy
I love her just so much
who''s hear in 2024
As someone from BC I’m so glad Narduar is essentially a household worldwide name (almost) :)
God he's so akward, But I'd defnelly do him
omg she is HILARIOUS
this guy is such a prick lol
Low iron is a good ick
good morning SAV❤
gosh i hate this man
I begrudgingly understand why Taylor liked him. Dudes annoyingly charismatic  Edit: it's been a week and I'm obsessed with this man. Like listening to whole albums type of obsessed
okay so matty is fully straight
why he kinda?
does she post full versions?
2:30
Nah sorry the kissing thingy was hot
She has a good sense of humor!
"I dont want to kiss you." "Why?" 🤣🤣
This is definitely the very best episode of chicken shop dates. Bring him back on another date pleaaaaseeeee
this is hard to watch
"i wouldnt call myself a genius" "You just did. 💅🏻"
“This is a lesson for you: don’t smoke.” That is more important than anything else in this video.
“you’re like in your slut era.” - Matty Healy 2023
I can’t believe this guy inspired 85% of TTPD, I’m pretty upset
This is my favourite.  Hilarious!
She should have asked: "Are you a racist?"
I kinda ship themmmm
How tf did this guy pull tay
I LOVE AMELIA
Her not kissing him back made my day
Look at the smallest man who ever lived randomly bringing up being young and relevant.  The hot girls part is cringe.  The part about him being a genius reminded me of kanye self proclaiming himself a genius 🤢 The least attractive trait being his personality is Gold!
So funny ''Dating me is an art '' love the monochrome bad smoking etiquette moment
"Girls but um hoh... hot girls." Is the least straight answer 🤣
This gave me the biggest laughs since the longest time
Or some gloves ...l ml ao
he fell in love with you within minutes.
Is it just me or does he look a bit like trigger from only fools and horses? Maybe it's just the suit style idk......😂
This video is hysterical 😹
The modern day Morrissey
Why this one not like 35mil views?
Lol he left her shook. You could visibly see it. Matty sure has an effect on the ladies. ❤😅
he did not match he exceeded her freak
That was genuinely the most hilarious date of all the chicken shop dates
I come here once a month to cringe, laugh and admire these two  I think it's the best date in the history of dates 😂
enemies to lovers 200k words slowburn
After i saw this video, i think taylor got her Karma for cheating and leaving Joe haha
im straight 😂😂
This is James and Alyssa in their 30s
I do not like this guys, but AMELIA was great. Wow his attitude was just wow.
I would’ve totally kissed him and I don’t know why
Taylor Swift deserves this man.
Matt went through all 7 stages of grief during this interview...... DATE! I love them though they're just as weird as eachother and I mean Amelia IS in her peak slut era so why not!!!  🤷‍♀️😂😂🤷‍♀️
Him being born is the 70's is believable honestly!
“Or some gloves” 😂
They both look like elfs with those ears 😂
Omg these two together are comedy gold 😂😂😂
Lmao!
Jehovah’s Witness suit boy.
£25 for the two chicken family meal is not bad actually
“I was born in 1989” I feel like I’m at Taylor’s show
I feel for every woman under 30 who has to find out the hard way that when you date a man like this, it is not going to end well.
Matt Alpha Male'd her to death
Smallest man that ever lived. 😅😅😅😅
0:31  gazing at her starry eyed, in his Jehovah’s Witness suit…
are they supposed to be celebrities?
He looks crunchy
why do people hate this guy lmao i love this guy bruh he just doesnt give a shit
That forehead kiss took me out.. 😂😂😂 I'm going to use it next time instead of ducking. 😂
Is he the only one who crossed physical barrier ? I can’t she kissed him in overhead ahahah
Oh my gosh, this was a disaster. He is so weird ew
he is so gross to watch
why does he talk like that lol
this is my favorite video ever, i think they need to get married now
The best one...by far!
Wait Taylor wanted him ?
2:18 “probably my eh… personality” LMAO
chicken inn🤣 didn't know i'd find it here too (zim people know what i'm talking about)
3:36 this moment 😂
I get it. I just get it. 💀
The hair twirl at 2:58
Theres sm duality in the comments between people who think hes serious and people who know its just a bit and hes being dry haha
"I have low iron" "well that's a turn off" 🤣🤣
so... you're telling me he was taylor's muse for ten years? wow
I didn't know him and now i'm in love
out of all the people she has interviewed i think they get along the best
Wow.... the smallest man who ever.....is also hella creepy
omg the slime
Low iron - that’s a turn off
This is still my fav episode of all time
"tumblr was my idea" 😭
This confirms my belief that any of Taylor Swifts songs about actual love aren’t about him. Anyone who thinks loml is about this twat is crazy. The only way I can imagine it playing out is her bailing after realizing how douchey he is.
Not with the n4z1 :(
omg i despise him
He’s so strange.
“just like nardwuar” is such a compliment holy shit 😂
Did you actually go out with H?
She's like a bulletproof vest against love bombers
She's the new Andy Milonakis
They look alike
0:38 the disappointment on his face...
The "pathetic" was the most british private school thing ever 😂😂😂
Matty is so funny, good timing and all. Amelia too, of course
Can someone move his hair away it’s itchy to watch lol
They way he never pulled the lock of hair in front of his eye back is crazy annoying I hate this guy. Don’t imagine pushing it behind his ear for him and kissing him lol it’s what he wants. Its uncomfortable to leave a lock like that in front of your eyes it’s just not what genuine people do.
Biggest egotistical prick since liam Gallagher
"that's pathetic" .........................rofl
Because i can take both of them
It's there's any one else
I just wanna say I'm in love with you
he's awful. no idea what anyone would see in him. rude, obnoxious, nasty energy
Wish she would have asked him about his parents. Must be hard living in the shadow of the legend that is Denise Welch
I want Amelia to play a Capella guitar at my birthday party. That’s all.
This is the first Amelia video I've seen. It wa the most fun, clever, flirty, akward, everything interview possible. Amelia gives Graham Norton a run for his money and then some!
I was born in 1975 and I don’t like that he was offended by that idea 😂😂😂😂
if matthew healy leaned across the table, looked me in the eye, and practically begged me to kiss him. im pretty sure one of my organs would burst
he is so funny, now i get everything ajajja, but theyre so funny LOL
did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed ?
i like this one more than the one with jack harlow
“I can reach” ❤
i finally get it. i get it girlies
Not going on a podcast was, indeed, good advice
Just heard that Matty is engaged. Congrats, Matty! 😃
I fucking love MATTYYYYYYY
I didn‘t know he was british and what did Taylor do with him??
"Trust me I can handle me a dangerous man" Taylor girl what are you talking about 😭
oh there he goes, the smallest man who ever lived
he’s such a prick LMFAO
why is this sooo cringe.
The fact that he got offended that she declined the kiss, he pushed it and kind of got it but even halfway there wasn't good enough... even tho she said nahh... he has an obsession with swapping spit, doesn't he? What is that about?????
He’s such a bore… love his music
He walked out in Taylor too 😢
Charming or a player, can't decide!
I think Ross should be next
This is the guy Taylor Swift fell for. SMH
U an aries🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Not to defend him but I think the last part is a skit? She denied the spudge and handshake (with spit 😂) because she was leading him on to do something more than those boring usual goodbye gestures. He got the cue and so insists on a kiss to “play” his part - being “that guy so full of himself to ask for a kiss on the first date.” As a content creator, that part was actually gold, proven by the views. Remember there are cameras and crew with them in there not just the two of them. If he does that off cam (like what most jerks do irl) then he deserves a beating. They maybe laugh it off afterwards and seem to be in good terms as this episode has been published in youtube. Just my two cents.
do you think tay and him were fucking already? (probably)
This was so fun I didnt expect to be.
3:15 what is going on
Watching after TTPD comes out to try to figure out what she saw on him
“I was gonna say, like, please don’t”  how did she know
1:43 HAHAHAHHAHAHAA 6:25 HAHAHHAHAHA 7:24 OMGGGG HAHDKEKDNSNDNENND 7:30 AMELIA I KNOW U FELT THE TENSIONNNN
I came here for T.S context and got it.
Am I the only one who found it disrespectful that he kept pressuring her to do the kiss
Beach ball
I have no idea who this guy is but he’s funny
He is AWFUL
He really wanted that kiss  💀
Looks like you’re going to a funeral - Maybe I am.        (Stolen, stupid!)
(gestures slowly)  "Exactly"
Matty reminds me of a guy you’d meet in the corner sofa of a room at an after party at 6am after a long night out where your both monged out and he just waffles on and on about shite and you wished you’d went home at 4am
That hair strand on his eye really bugs me.
i'm here to see what taylor saw in this man
She said you’re an Aries and he took that personally 😂
amelia’s stronger than me if matty offer me a kiss i wouldn’t think twice even though i hate that man
That guy is a walking red flag.
Still my favorite of all and hits the best. Also, still funny all this time later. M. H. is 'next level.'  He is only matched by Amelia (a true talent because she makes those opposite her the best they can be on camera).
dream guest
I always end up coming back to this interview
Matty kinda came off a creep there. Dragging our name down 😢
I’m a 36 yr old straight guy who stumbled into this video. I’d date him
Oh he actually is that awful. How did that Tolkien creature influence TTPD???
Definetelly i'm Amelia in real life.
Okay I see what Taylor saw.
One of Dimoldenberg’s favourite dates was a fairly recent one. Matty Healy, The 1975 frontman and chronic smoocher, was uniquely game to push the date further than most guests are willing. Even after being playfully mocked by Dimoldenberg’s interrogative questions, he propositions her with a request no one has made before, an “earnest kiss”. One can imagine this is the kind of romantic moment Chicken Shop Date was made for, but Dimoldenberg settles for a peck on the forehead. “If the cameras weren’t on, I definitely would’ve kissed him,” she says. “It just wasn’t right, I think it would’ve been so weird.”  “I actually told him afterwards, ‘You probably don't know this, but I was falling out of love with the format,’” she recalls. Chicken Shop Date in its various iterations has been going on for close to a decade now, and even the most exhilarating of shows can start to feel tired at some stage. "I’m not bored, but I just needed to have some energy put back into it. I needed to feel energised by it. And then that episode happened and the energy was so different. It just made me fall back in love with the series,” she clarifies. “I said that to him and he was like, ‘I need a cigarette,’ and he just walked off.”  - Amelia about the date for anyone interested
He's hot
Loved this so much - probably your best x
this is so painful to watch... and it's even more painful to hear him talking
but why is the food so expensive
The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived…indeed.
Who is this guy?? He looks like a tool.  Why would such amazing women like Taylor and Amelia give this guy the time of day??
he was born in WHAATTT???
He’s so ick. Like a young Montgomery Burns.
"or some gloves" 🤣 This one has to be the best date! Actually no, the one with Paul Mescal is the best because he's this cutest thing but this one is a close second! And of course, Keke Palmer, a close third. There, best trio!
So girls, "just guls"
i never would’ve resisted that offer 😭
Seeing this after TTPD and trying to make sense. That man is obviously hurting inside and I am not talking about the breakup. He seems chronically ill, like you can't really tell what his personality is like because he is trying too hard to not give away too much so he is mimicking her. Is someone else seeing this, or just me?
The genius Jehovah's Witness
Jehovah witness looking ass suit
That was so awkward 😂
Well okay. I get it now, I would do the same thing after Joe lol
Jehovas wittness suit….
7:34 well I kinda see it taylor.. but only for a casual thing (just sex) not as someone to fall in love with!!
“You’re an Aries” Visible disgust “oh god”
Look at this small man in a jehova’s witness suit!!!
I'm not seeing how he is desirable? 24 year old female here
They are SO adorable together. I hope they fall in love and get married. 🥰
I have never seen such a perfect example of two autistic people attempting to date before. The chemistry is off the charts.
I LOVE that he referenced Nardwuar!!!!  😂
Amelia is brilliant, this is so funny 😂
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how English children are made.
the kiss part was creepy ngl I cringed
Intellectual humor is the best kind..
this was funny
4:25 lmao he should've listened to her
She's repulsed by him  Replulsed.  Understandably. Taylor, wtf....
I love Matty, his humor and sarcasm is brilliant and the chemistry with Amelia is one of the most funnier and entertaining things I’ve seen in years!
"I didn't think I'd be your type." "Well, you're here."  💀
What a QUEEN to refuse that kiss!!!!
I'm sure it was a lovely interview but I could look at nothing except the strategically placed strand of hair blocking his right eye.
He’s giving ICK   I hope Travis Kelce is blowing her mind and back out 😅
I've watched this interview an unhealthy amount of times. 🤣
He probably slept with her after
Here to check on Taylor's sanity level and alright, he could be cute in a dark bar if you're drunk but damn is he annoying AF thinking he's the absolute sh!t, isn't he?  He's one of those moody guys who thinks he's sooooo smart but doesn't need to go to college to be a philosopher so just recycles cringy esoteric garbage and goes to his grave thinking his mediocre white ass was an immeasurable blessing to the world.  EYEROLL, GIRL COME ON.
I think it’s the accent
This interview actually made me laugh 😂 the answers they gave to each other. They actually make a good couple, NGL. Their personalities match perfectly
I'm so happy Taylor is with Travis.
Someone is using new Taylor Swif album for promotion 😂
I don't get the hype around this Amelia person. Watching her flirt/insult him was painful.
He’s born in 1989! Same year as Taylor! Ahhhhh
can't y'all watch normally without bringing up taylor like just appreciate both artists fucking hell
He's just, yuck.
Pls him leaning over the table 😅
God knows how many times I have watched this interview
"you tweeted about doing a podcast, i was just gonna say, like, please don't" I'M CRYING
He comes across as a red flag don’t know y
People who watched this before TTPD 😂❤🎉 People watching this after TTPD 🤬🤮🚭
Is this a joke this man and his band are absolutely bad and I mean really bad what has music come to😂😂😂😂
Is this a joke this man and his band are absolutely bad and I mean really bad what has music come to😂😂😂😂
This is so funny
What exactly makes this artful? I'm just asking...
The moleskin bit was too funny
How can people look at this and think this isn't the Jehovah's Witness suit?
taylor is crazy and now i kinda get it. but the shift from joe to this to travis is the craziest thing
She said she can fix him☹️
He’s a hater first human second
Hes gross. Idk what @taylorswift was thinking! She scored a homerun with travis conpared to this clown 😂
Why dont youuu buy meee 🥰 some iron supplements? "Or GLOVES 😐"
NEWSFLASH: The Swifties who don't get Matty Healy, and why Taylor fell in love with him, are the very same people who come on here and don't get the fact that this is a 'bit'. This constant confusing of Matty's stage persona with who he is as a person, the man Taylor fell in love with, is just exhausting at this point. I think part of this stems from the fact that while he is frontman for The 1975, he is not just a musician, a massive part of his art and creativity is performance e.g. Consumption from recent SATVB tour. It is not just about the music, but about exploring modern life, adult themes and boundaries in a thought provoking, often controversial, manner. Meanwhile Swifties expect him to act like a boy scout, totally missing the point.  I will make a prediction now, it won't be today or tomorrow, but their story isn't over yet. He has quietly, even when they each are in other relationships, been one of her most significant influences in the background, because this is not just about physical attraction, although they have amazing chemistry, but they are also SO creatively and intellectually compatible. Matty has an amazing intellectual knowledge of music, culture, art and philosophy, which is evidenced in the fact that he has two Ivor Novello awards, for Songwriter of the Year, and Best Contempory song (2019). Jon Caramanica and Joe Coscarelli from the NYT have a very insightful discussion about Matty's intellectual knowledge and artistry, and how it relates to Taylor, in their podcasts, both this year and last. It is also evident in any of the serious interviews Matty has done, with the likes of Tom Power and Zane Lowe, which are both on YT.  So keep imagining that a 'So High School' type romance with a 'bro' like Travis is going to be intellectually stimulating enough for Taylor in the long-term. A guy who doesn't even know what a 'pseudonym' is, let alone how to spell it, no offence to him, but he is hardly an intellectual or creative match for one of the greatest wordsmiths of the modern era. Even the one or two songs apparently inspired by him are notably weak lyrically, as there is just no depth to him. Conversely, Matty is the one who got away (twice), that will be catnip for Taylor, and the lure of the decade long lore between those two, to the Tumblr era, will be impossible to ignore. The next point of public engagement will be the next The 1975 album release...and the cycle will continue.
The tattooed Golden Retriever
love to this one
Addicted to betrayal but you're "relevant"
I don't blame Taylor after watching this, this guy is dreamy
What an exhausting popinjay
It’s quite unfortunate that I enjoy him . Truly.
Soooo we are all here to see the smallest man that ever lived in action huh
God he is so disgusting! 🤮
What did Taylor see in him?
Taylor, I'm sorry. I think I get it now
goodness hes hideous
Who has this popping  on his fyp suddenly after TTPD? 😂
not Matty calling himself a genius within the first 3 minutes of the interview >.>
“or some gloves” 😂😂
i too would like to know her response to what happened with aitch that hurt meee
I think Taylor dodged a bullet.
I just don’t get it Taylor 🤢
I think I get it now. 😂
That was funny.
7:23 - Taylor, I get it
Wait if he’s straight and not lying- does that mean that Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus is about JOE???
Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead? Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed? Were you writing a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy? In fifty years, will all this be declassified? And you'll confess why you did it And I'll say good riddance 'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden I would've died for your sins Instead, I just died inside And you deserve prison, but you won't get time You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars You crashed my party and your rental car You said normal girls were boring But you were gone by the morning You kicked out the stage lights But you're still performing And in plain sight you hid But you are what you did And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive The smallest man who ever lived
oh taylor honey... thank god you woke up
he was dating taylor at the time
That piece of hair! It’s bothering me
they should do a 2nd date! would be massive
yup still my favourite date
🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is hilarious. HA! I don't know why you came across my feed, but I'm glad. OH, well, I do watch a lot of comics here. 😊  😅@7:20 why?!
I can't believe Cardigan was about him.
This is hysterical. I don’t know who either of these people are, but they have great comedy timing 😂
Jehovas wittness suit...
"Or some gloves" still gets me, man
Ew
I first came here when Matty was getting called out for racist and sexist remarks and didn't find much to be insulted by, actually.   My biggest take away is that he tries slightly too hard to act as though he doesn't care which makes him seem like a adorably awkward adolescent finding himself the of attention yet not *quite* sure what to do with it.  That definitely has a certain appeal to a certain people.  Coming back to this after TS and TTPD, I can absolutely understand why so much of that album may have been fueled by him and not Joe.   Travis is far too new to have made it completely into her songwriting so we'll see where he shows up in future work.   A six year relationship in your 20s or early 30s is *massive*.  What she went through personally previous and during her relationship with Joe and the depth of emotional intimacy that probably occurred often becomes creative material years, if not decades after because the sh*t is flipping subterranean.   It's dense and heavy, frightening and painful.  Doing a post-mortem on a deep connection is often excruciating.  I think she has a healthy respect for Joe and is wise to let it rest.    Matty was a rebound.  I'm not saying that TS was simply DTF but hot flings that come right after break ups of long term relationships can be crazy chaotic and volatile and frequently do not pan out.  This makes them especially fertile creative materials because of the flash point passion that comes with the territory.  Processing the relationship with Joe is more akin to mourning the loss of something grounded, quiet, and safe.   OTOH, processing a fling with Matty - a wild child work in progress who thrives on irreverence, mildly insulting antics, and attention - well, the songs practically write themselves!
This is the most british thing Ive ever seen. I love it 😂😂
‘I’m in love with you’ is his favourite lyric…just before he got back with Taylor
I would actually die if Matty Healy asked me to kiss him
at least he’s self aware . His personality is definitely his least attractive trait
“Jehovah’s witness suit”
Why can I smell him tho
Don't understand why Taylor loved him, he's so cocky
was this a bit or is he actually like that?????
I still think he’s a knob, but half wondering here if it was put on (like dialed up to 20x more than normal) for comedy reasons.
the smallest man who ever lived
hes just wilbur soot but even worse i hope they get put in jail together and rot
SHE KISSED HIS FOREHEAD i'm dead ahahahah
6:21 first official meeting of The Tortured Poets Department
KISS HIM YOU FOOL!!!!!
Of course he’s an Aries.❤❤❤❤❤ same.
How do you like your chicken?   Raw of course.
Okay yeah Taylor I totally get it
...in your Jehova's witness suit...
The Tortured Poets Department was for this queen and this queen only
Who’s here AFTER TTPD? 😂
I enjoyed this more than I expected😂😂😂
here after ttpd and god this man is as bland as turkey alwyn and unappealing to look at
The smallest man that ever lived
I felt nervous the entire video!!! OMG
They matched each other’s bullshit energy and he wasn’t expecting that and I do believe he was genuinely into it and so was she just a smidge.
ok, how they keep almost breaking is killing me. this is hilarious
Like his voice. Hate the way he talks. Okay what is so attractive about him tho. I don't get it!😂😂😂
This is by far the best chicken shop date
favourite chicken shop date
Taylor swift told her he likes that water
no one can make me hate this man
I see what TS saw in him. Let me rephrase, I see what a damaged and hurt woman might see in a pretentious unavailable man who seems very confident despite his very unattractive looks and personality. He's the tortured bad boy who seems to cool to be true. he's the type of man that plays with your heart , love bombs you, and promises you the world only to GHOST you and make you feel like you imagined everything and the whole thing was in your head and you are crazy. Then he hoovers around you for years, he knows what buttons to push and how to make you feel special when you feel worthless. And the cycle continues until you are strong again and you've matured. You see his cheap tricks and his true nature. He becomes pitiful and unattractive. You see him for what he is "THE SMALLEST MAN WHO EVER LIVED"
Who is here for research purposes? 😅
This is honestly one of the best..I have watched this numerous amount of times😂
Yeah, I’m here after TTPD too wtf 😂
oh there he is. the rat. the smallest man who ever lived
say what you want about Matty but he's incredibly charming, he just oozes charisma.
"Low iron?" "Thats a turnoff" 🤣🤣🤣
im here again
I used to think what’s the big deal with Matty but he is rather gorgeous ❤
I am a minute in and I need him to move that hair from in front of his eye.
To all the "Sarah's and Hanna's in their Sunday best" listen to But Daddy I love him.  Taylor is asking everybody to lay off criticizing her choices. Plus you have to understand British sarcasm. Don't take it so seriously.
some will never grow up  zero boundaries
What the fuck Taylor
he actually does look like a golden retriever!
the smallest man who ever lived...
This is one of the best dates. Peak awkward humor. I felt that „Oh god” in my soul 😂.
This man
'I can reach'. Ooo he just flooded my basement. 🤗
I just found out about Matty, no clue who this girl is, and just now stumbled on this video. 😆😆
Not me revisiting this bit after listening to the Tortured Poets Department and wondering what the f**k Taylor saw in this lump of cold, wet, moldy cheese.
Is this The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived?
So I have no idea who this guy is, but after watching this I definitely like him.
Calling him out as someone who looks like he carries a moleskin everywhere is so on point.
Who's here after processing TTPD and trying to figure out what the **** it is about this man that inspired Halsey and Taylor to write MASTERPIECES of songs about him?
The kiss bit was so uncomfortable. She handled it well but wtf man. Disgusting.
This is so funny 😂😂
This is a comfort video for me
That man is already so taken... by his ego, the love of his life. (The gloves-part was really funny though.) Amelia just makes his little world fall apart.😅Absolutely brilliant.
I came to see what all the fuss was about 🙄😂
Is anyone here after the new Taylor Swift album TTPD 😂 this interview happened around the same time him and Taylor were together??
Funny 😂
Literally perfect dry sarcastic banter. To ppl saying he’s insufferable - he’s matching her energy and humor to a tee. This is some of the best flirting I’ve ever seen i love when ppl can pick up on another persons’ style of humor and go toe to toe with them after only knowing them a few mins. Thats the definition of chemistry lol
who's here after listening to TTPD loooool
"You have low iron?  Well, that's a turn-off."  LOLOLOL
damn Taylor was willing to burn her life to the ground for this rat
Excuse my sacrilege and ignorance but... WHO IS THIS EXTREMELY HOT BRITISH YOUNG BENICIO DEL TORO.
“Do you carry a moleskin around with you, you look like you would” hahahahah
I love this one... better than the Jack Harlow one
Happy Birthday Matty please don’t accidentally look at the eclipse and go blind today
Or some gloves 😂
They both have massive ears 👂
88 here.. Thank you!! Yes you are still young and relevant! Anyone from 84 and up is still young and relevant!
THIS IS ART!
rewatching this again because i miss matty
I enjoyed this so much :DDDDDDDDDDD
He nuts in under 5 mins and talks about himself the whole time you’re with him btw
amelia refusing the kiss added 10 years to my lifespan
Amelia, I'm Keith from America, and I just saw you for the first t time. Your dry British humor, is so hilarious. I'm a producer of television and I too am an interviewer, but the schtick that you used to talk to him was so entertaining. So, I just want to say that you made that into a comedy experience, and I know it was fake and therefore a wonderful dry humor approach.  I also very much fancy your accent. To my ear, there are different British accents, and yours sound beautiful to my ear.  So keep doing this, and now I'll be watching Everything you produce.  Here is my advise. Change...nothing.  Your great just the way you are...and thank you for the Sunday morning coffee comedy.
Why does he remind me of wilted lettuce
One of the best.
I love sandwiches.
i love her
This might start a cultural revolution
This is top tier chicken shop date
favourite lyric has got to be.. It's not about reciprocation, it's just all about me ,A sycophantic, prophetic, Socratic junkie wannabe And there's so much skin to see A simple Epicurean philosophy
Why does he look like Violet Chachki
Ah she wanted to kiss him really
This is the best episode. Proof of concept, funny and awkward.
This was brilliant😆
This guy is crease
He seems like a tool
I like maty very much. Don't know about the teenage kiss but probably don't know her age. Its not dalai lama😂
Gross
"I thought I could get arrested for smoking inside"💀 This interview was a masterpiece. I love how Matty came prepared. He naturally has the energy to match hers so tastefully🤭🤭
Never had more fun watching a bad date 😂
He looks like he smells bad.
This is brilliant. Good on him xD
Buy me some iron supplements...."or some gloves" hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
recién se levantaba de la siesta el tipo
"Or some gloves."
I am dying 💀💀🤣🤣🤣
If Matt called me gorgeous not once but twice, I could die a very happy woman!
Nahh this video is too british lmaoo
I forgot Brits say DOCTOR Martens
He’s the kinda dude that would say “come on what’s the big deal” to a girl that rejected his advances to have sex
It was funny from the beginning but I was giggling aloud at his “inventions”
xd
Matty just seemed so conflicted during this whole thing. He’s like… I only date got people… not you. But talking to you now I kinda get it.. wow you’re actually kinda flirty.. that smoking was so unattractive please kiss me
i’m binging all her dates - this one is so great
I can’t believe she rejected a kiss from THEE matt healy, 12 year old me is literally scratching the walls at tht
These episodes are all entertaining and fun, but this one in particular is truly funny. Love the banter.
Matty Healy is so cringe and insufferable like.. hes just an overall pick
He’s got sad eyes
Would you buy me iron supplements or gloves..hahaha
something about him always gives me the ick
him playing with the singular tendril of hair gave me the most genuine ick...
what is Nardwar?
“Or some gloves!!” 😂😂😂
I not nervous , im low iron
Another successful interaction with a male
"Tumblr was my idea" 😂😂😂 the way he carried that app in 2015 was insane
Best episode 🎉. @ameliadimoldenberg can we get a second date with Matty? He’s exceptional and really funny
WE NEED A SECOND DATE WITH MATTY!! I can’t keep rewatching this it’s becoming unhealthy 😂😂
One of her best dates! Amelia was genius - brilliant.
This is the one. SO FUNNY yet you’ve got the awkawardness haha
This was deliciously awkward 😂😂
he looks so old now holy shit
Brilliant
This HAS to be the best one!!
He would be a terrible boyfriend. Kissing his forehead was the safest bet.
its too good
"why don't you buy me some iron supplements?" "Or some gloves?" 😂😂😂
What was Taylor Swift thinking 😅
This is pure magic.
He is such a fxcking Aries ♈ .......😬😔😑🤐🤫🫣🫣🫣🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄😠🤬😎🤡💔👁️👄👁️👎🏼👎🏼🖕🏼🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️🙎‍♀️🫏🕴️🐃🛟🪔🎬⌛💬🚭🆘🚩🚩🚩 Good for you on sticking with the NOOOOOO! I DON'T WANT TO KISS YOU! I can't believe he said, pathetic. I know that's a common (England) English term that they use a lot kinda like cunt. First of all Aries HATE the word NO! So good for you, sticking to your original answer to him which was NO! The crazy thing is you should not have to say no more than once to a guy. He was BEING pathetic, I'm not saying he IS pathetic just to be clear. He acted so butt hurt when you refused his advances/request/demands/pressure. I think this is a perfect example of how many times is too much.......? I know this is a show and it's just for fun, but you could feel her vibe and she was like......now, NEVER---BuhBye!
These two vibe like no other ❤ more Amelia and Matty please !
So random, but can we get a Chicken Shop Date with Nardwuar?🙊
“You don’t need to do this”😂
“I’m low on iron”  “That’s a turn off” 😂😂😂
"I have low iron" "Well that's a turn off" ded
Probably one of the best chicken shop dates ever❤
What does she ask him at 5:07 ?
How did I get here!  No clue who these people are, but how did she not ask him if that stupid piece of hair doesn’t bother him 😂
Beach ball
Matty Rules ✊🏼
Omg on 5:27 he said “slut era” knowing now that he wrote the unreleased version of “Slut!” is so metaverse
He caught on quick! I think they could be great sparring partners... in all sorts of ways.
The kiss hahahahaha
I'ma need a Nardwuar date, you know.
This is pure gold 😂
That after I would have to Imagine Interaction was high art
Want more Matt healy and Amelia
Is this banter? This feels like banter.
SCREAMING AT THE KISS
Wow, I think he's the first one to completely match her energy. This is like watching a movie where two lovers meet but both are secret agents tasked with killing the other one, but friendly. I loved this.
Hahahaha I’d kiss him.  I can’t believe she didn’t
So british
Her face when he said “my personality” killed me 😂
Back here watching this for the 7,432nd time. Still great.
"I have low iron" "Low iron?" "Yeah" "Well, that's a turnoff"  😂😂😂😂
lmao 🤣
Really should’ve kissed him at the end
textbook dating skills are here
Is H harry styles
Genius 😂😂 ffs
These two have the best chemistry.
This two make a great match
you do NOT know how hard i just laughed at the sight of someone trying to blow out a cigarette like that 🤣🤣🤣
i need him
He wrote a song about me, so...❤
My Favorite date
he's so boring like geeezz i hate him so much
his reaction to the kiss
She’s ready to carry his baby
That forehead kiss was so wholesome and adorable.
The end made me feel weird….back off king
Hysterical. 😂
Wouldve been cooler if she kissed him.
the part where she pretends to play the guitar... "why are you going up it?" "what is that?" 😂
Dang I wish that kiss had happened
Genius 😂
they're totally meant to be
Best date ever... still!
The boy was really going in for the kiss... lived it😆😍
I'm here during mustache era.
I have no clue who he is, but this is amazing!!!
My grandfather owns the chicken shop! 🐔
3:33
Dude what the heck this is ridiculously hilarious but poor Matt looks exhausted
“You have low iron? That’s a turn off” 😭😂
came back after dominic fike to say nothing compares to this one
Nobody commenting on the shared spit äh cigarette?! What a move 😮😂🎉
The best epi!!!!
I love everything about this date ❤😂
The interview that made me fall in love with this sweet genius of a man. Go on another date he promised to.
Beach ball
I thought this was violet chatchki out of drag in the thumbnail
this was the best episode
Did he ask if she went out with Harry?
Why does it look like that
I’m obsessed with them both
5:33
❤😂
Love the matching energy here😂
14-11-23 1:40
Sorry but not really- it’s HYSTERICAL to me that there are people using this as one of the reasons to hate Matty. This is some of the breeziest, silly satire I’ve seen and I love it.
Low key Matt’s nonchalant personality is doing something for me
I think Matty Healy is kind of skeazy..he seems to have some self awareness tho.. ending was so cringe- he seriously though he’d get a kiss out of this?    This was entertaining..Amelia had him hooked!
“You have low iron? That’s a turnoff” LMFAO
He was ready!
or some gloves...i fucking lost it lmao
he is racist!!!
I’m so obsessed with this
She is fuckin SO GOOD at this 😅
Or some gloves
He's so insufferable
that kiss bit was fucking freakyyy why was he so insistent
It's hard to tell where the bellendness stops being an act
please go on a second date with Matty
i found it. i found the most awkward interview xD
“Or some gloves” 😂
sorry this guy has such bad vibes i’m very uncomfortable with the energy he is bringing
High art I can’t
Matty "I watch Ghetto Gaggers" Healy
Or Some Gloves! 😂
“What’s your worst trait?”   Matty: “my personality” 😂🤣😂
I have no ides who he is but i would immediately take a kiss from him lol
‘Probably my personality’ LMFAOOO
Healy's words in their songs are my favorite part, but I also fully adore their musical artistry.
Creeepy vibes ngl
2:36
“Im still young and relevant” ugh! That one hit close to home 🥹
This is my fav one
he gives me the ick so much
I wish they were a real couple 😌
A year later and still slaps. My absolute favorite date hands down. Chemistry is off the charts
Brother lookin like the flushed away rat...dipped his head in the fry oil
poor amelia having to kiss that rat
I cannot imagine this man dating a bubbly Taylor swift 😂
Any drag race fans here, he looks like Violet Chachki
He reminds me of Violet Chachki out of drag 😅
“Or some gloves.”
Favorite lyric “you look shit and you smell a bit”
She rejected the kiss. Go next
Definitely one of the best. Still laughing after several watches.  Low iron, that’s a turn off.😂
Probably my favorite date of them all.
i think i figured it out...  the dates are reminiscent of a text message conversation.
his disappointment at carrying a moleskin around with him SENT me
My fav: "Why dont you buy me some iron" ...."or some gloves!"
I genuinely find this dude really off putting but Amelia has the ability to make even the biggest douchebags likeable
So when’s the wedding? 😩
“That’s a turn off” 😂
😭😭
One of the best
matty likes amelia
low iron is a turn off????💀💀💀😂😂😂
why are these filmed like they're not in the same room
These 2 need their own show
Matty Healy likes strawberry flavoured water and I like strawberry flavoured water
He’s funny af 😂😂
Mr. Matt Healy, fuck Twitter! Do you! We love you!
oR sOmE gLoVeS 😂
0:21 loud ass trumpet bro wtf 😭😭😭
Matty is so nervous in this! its so cute
Kissing someone cos they're boring you is my dating life
the funniest 8 minutes of 2 ppl talking about nothing i´ve ever seen.
I love Matty's sense of humor 😂
Is that Violet Chatki out of drag?
Best episode!
Loved this soooooo much!!!
the forehead kith SENTTTTTTT me
This is the best chicken shop episode in history lol. Period.
Amelia makes him look good
I wish her episodes were longer 😢😢😢xx
She's so happy from inside and it radiates to her guests/dates.
"this is a lesson for you. DON'T SMOKE."  LMFAAOOOOOOO 7:00
This was magical lmao
I actually laughed so hard at the end that my phone fell on my face and i actually have a bruised lip now-
I hope they date for real omg the chemistry is so awkward yet so real 😂❤
"Or gloves" lol
“THIS IS KINDA LIKE YOUR SLUT ERA” omg lol
💀
Pov you read the comments, realize he tries to kiss and immediately click off.
i want him
He is only impulsive in his art...ya right! He is seductively bold!
I love the moments they aren’t as quick as her and quickly jump on or back paddle there way 😂💀
Dying laughing. So good
Jajajajaja her face when he says he's a genius 😝😝😝i love her ❤️‍🔥
He’s a slimy, racist creep 😂
If that quiet "oh god" from Matty after she mentions astrology needs to be a meme if it isn't already.
he was creepy to her
that s the funniest one
Man has negative game
I love her concept of this whole interview thing. She doesnt hide her awkwardness but with her quick witted personality she can get out of the situation like this but for others they dont understand the difference between her awkwardness and her personality. So essentially shes a nervous and awkward person and doesnt hide that but instead embraces and uses quick thinking on top of that to trip and trick people up. So cool
It’s funny how he said described “Hot girls” to the ones that he’s mostly appealed by from a dynamic aspect.
Amelia is sweet and quite unusual from this particular date. At the end if I was Matty to sneaking a kiss, it would’ve been a heartwarming hug.
this comment section is fucking braindead
This was really bad and weird and awkward and extremely chaotic and wholesome, I loved it.
I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!HAAAHHAHAa
this didnt age well
This whole thing was hilarious 😂 loved it. And love matty's sense of humour
We love an innovator
This racist dog 😂
She wanted to kiss him
Such dates are needed more & more..the man is smarter of the two.
The second the lighter turned on … had me on the floor 🤣🤣🤣
This is how a genuine Alpha, near top of his game, age 34, behaves around women. Indifferent, slightly annoyed, trying to see if this is worth his time.
God what an insufferable man
Look Matt idc you can have her
Proud matty Healy hater 🩷🩷🩷
I'm new-ish to the Chicken Shop Dates world and have gone through many of them now. They've all been great! I saw lots of people rave about this one and...I honestly hated it. Every answer he gave was off-putting to me. I don't know this man, so maybe he was doing a character to play along with the bit? Whatever the reason, I could go without ever seeing this interview again.
Did not expect him to be so effeminate
That strand of hair is getting in the way of his visionary genius
DISGUSTING RACIST
if red flags was a person.
they could not even pretend hahah
This guy is the worst kind of racist🤢👎👎👎👎
i saw this and another interview but wow he comes across as the worst person in the world. weird to hear the easy going music they produce and this is the douche behind it
Don’t care if this is scripted or edited to hell and back I love it
I've watched this hundreds of times, and  I still piss myself laughing when she  says 'why don't you buy me some iron supplements '
Matt Healy is gross
wouldn't be matty if he didn't say the words "meta", "earnest" and tried to kiss you
No.1 Rule: if you go to somebody place or country always respect their rules. Matt don't go to a country if you disagree with its laws
I don’t know how people can look at his face. It’s so hideous.. but still nowhere as disgusting as what he’s said
He had her so fucked up at the end there.
Look at his EARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The white supremacist drug addict that got a music festival cancelled?
They missed “you lit the wrong end of the cigarette” 😭😭
This is the MOST British thing I've ever seen!
I'm an eleva-uh
Please do a part 2!
The face she pulls when he says, 'my personality'. Genius 😂😂
They f’d after this for sure.
So she is a zack Galifinakas wannabe ?
bro got banned while tour in malaysia HAHAHAHAHAH
vile vile man
I feel like I'm attracted to Matty Healy out of 1) spite and 2) because he looks and acts like every situationship I've been in for too long because I'm down bad Idk how to analyse this
amelia looks good here
Good for you girl!!!
She’s annoying and he’s hot.
He’s such a pillock
This was fun!!!
So you're an Aries! 😂
This is my fave episode of all. Both are just being silly n fun
This is the most passive aggressive interview I've ever seen
You can tell they like each other and probably will end up in bed 🙂
yall do understand that this man is Islamophobic ? racist and a horrible person in general?
All THAT dirty talk like "You should buy me iron supplement"  - damn that is HOT 🔥🔥🔥
I rewatched this a uncomfortable amount of times. They are both brilliant.
Imagine being a genius- 'I dont have to imagine', she is too quick with it 😂
6:57 “so unattractive” lmfaoooo
8:21 Trying too hard to be Johnny Cash😜😂
I feel like this video helped me understand british banter and having good chat
This is the one
This guy is a WEIRDO.
HES MAD FINE
He is a "little crazy musician", as you know all artist is a unique person. Maybe Matt get high when he on stage.
MATTY IS SO FINE BRO
Sexual harassment. Creep.
7:02
6:54
She's really good at what she does lol
Meh he’s cancelled
Brilliant 😂❤
straight but kissed a homie ????
Aged like milk
This is so awkward and so good.
Matty pulling himself through the Dirt like that has me falling in Love with him even more
How come i spent only 3 minutes watching an 8 minute video? What are these feelings im feeling?
He used the word “unattractive” to describe her a couple times. He has am odd manipulative tactic to try to get women to want his approval. Really don’t like this dude whoever he is
She has changed ever since her date with Aitch and Jack Harlow
Amelia is my new favorite person on the internet 😄❤️
He’s like a British gross version of Tyler posey
Why don't you buy me some Iron Supplements....lmao
Or gloves 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Legit the best one I've seen so far! lmao that was such a journey...
Tosser.
The cigarette bit was hilarious! 😂
hes so weirdd!! what a weird freak man!!!
I’m watching this drunk and it’s even beter lol hahahahahahahhahahaha
I must watch this date at least 5 times a week
DO ANOTHER WITH MATTYYYYYY
This was so painful.
I’m 54 y/o grew up with Fleetwood Mac/Eagles and I love the 1975 huge Matty Healy fan for someone my age so very talented!
He likes hot girls but he isn’t clearly at all
I really dont see how him and Taylor would have gotten on...banter and all. Theyre like polar opposites
Am I the only one who comes back to this video because she feels like she caught a glimpse of a real, genuine spark that was actually totally and completely inadvertent, and it's exciting to see and it gives big butterflies, but it's also super bittersweet because it ended when the bit ended and they both just kinda went their separate ways? Like, I feel this way about this video more than any other video of hers.
surprised all of the fruitcakes arent here in the comments complaining about Matty lol great episode
He is soo annoying
Matty Healy is hilarious!
its like nardwar
"You tweeted about maybe doing a podcast, I was gonna say, please don't." huh he should have probably followed that advice with all the current drama after the podcast lol
I like that I can’t reach u on my date 😂I like it
"Iron? What abt some gloves?" HAHAHA m dying
this felt a lttle too real at bits, like in a negative way lol
He looks hideous.
this has got to be my favourite one it felt like a reeallll date hahaaa
He gives me the ick
i see you matty healy trying to do the one hair strand that zayn did. you will not!! have the same impact
the fact that this was filmed near where i live?? i'm sick that i did not spot it happening live
I watch this video like once a week and I swear, him saying he invented the beach ball is my favorite thing that's ever happened.
I’ve always hated Matty Healy but I’ve watched this maybe 15 times :-/
Characterizing oneself as a genius is narcissism. Come on! Hendrix is a genius. Matty looks like he's on chemicals.
Girl if MATTY HEALY asks you to kiss him, you leap the damn table to do it 😂😂😂😂
this is my comfort video
This interview format is awful
i think he was high while filming what the hell is this
taylor dated this guy??..
him begging for a kiss got me 💀
Matty referencing Nardwuar is amazing. Epic!
that end bit didn't really... yikes...
He really is quite the bellend.
The ending was awkward like wtf
Girl got Matty Healy down bad!!
This really is one of the best episodes. I come back to watch it from time to time and it makes me laugh EVERY time. I wonder why it hasn't more views
Can anyone explain the moleskin comment? lol
6:32 - ‘you don’t need to do this’ got me good hahah
what water bottle does he like? lol!
This was so great ❤
Amelia was so real for telling him not to do a podcast lmao
That was legit wierd
idk i didn't like anything about him
Just realised he said "its like Nardwuar" ❤
The chemistry was ON POINT.
100% the best one
he's definitely a 2/10
Smelly nepo baby
Best interview ever. I can watch it a million times.
Cold hands, warm heart!
He’s comes across as pretentious,  insecure & mediocre
Just stopped by to say. If ever they decide to do a new BATMAN and need someone for the Penguin part, you defo got it in the bag!
😂😂😂
He gives me ‘crazy’ vibes. 🙅🏼‍♀️
This was brilliant
Amelia would be kissing millions of other girls, if she kissed Matty
Ew he grows
"I was born in 1989, and I'm still young, and relevant."  Tell that to Taylor Swift.
The hatred I hold for this ratman is unparalleled
4:25 PROPHETIC lol
She said no like 10 times
Amelia saw the future when she said no podcast 😭
I have had a very bad week in my life and down. This video lifted me up . Thank you @amelia
Great chemistry, so much fun! Matty's reaction to 'what's your star sign' cracks me up everytime.... Love you both ❤
Why is he so fucking creepy
“Tumblr was my idea” lmaooo
Shoulda followed that advice about not podcasting...
‘I was born in 1989, I’m still relevant’ tell that to the younger people who don’t know who you are, oh and the ones born before 76. Can we get a vote here? 😂
She needs to do one of these with Geordie Greep from Black Midi
Kiddy fiddler
I would kiss him😭
Her: why don't you buy some iron supplements😊 Him; or some gloves😂 got me rolling😂😂LMAO
Opening with "so you were born in 1975."fffffffffffaahahaaaaaaa
4:27 Yeahh he should’ve taken the advice 😂😂😂
It would have been hilarious if she‘d taken a photo of her food and lit the fag from the wrong end
Damn I've been in stitches 😂😂😂😂😂😂
These are actually gas😂
i love how matty really get deep trying to understand the concept of the show
He is so foul
Why don’t you buy me some iron supplements? Him or gloves!! Love that lol
hes so cute , gorgeous scamp i love his personality ❤❤
plsss make another date w him soon i love this vid sm
3:35 is so funny
I really like him.
I love this so much I always come back and watch it at least every two weeks
Omg when he licks his lips after saying to do a god honest kiss you could see Amelia's eyes get wider and shit got even more tense....dude i felt that shit too 🔥
"What's your sign?"  A big question in the 'late '60s.
Amelia is a goddess.
Wait… if he was born in 1975, how did he invent sandwiches in 1762?? 🤔
As a low iron person we do have cold hands🤣
Can they date already
Amelia!! You missed out on a great kiiissssss. He was readyyyy! He even licked his lips..he was so ready...dang it.....I'm pissed:))
A Nardwuar the Human Serviette (that's his real name) reference! Nardwuar has gone far for a college radio guy.
i won't click this video because i thought amelia is amber heard. i swear. LOL
We're all a bit needy....      Matty Healy
he reminds me of elvis costello... 😂🤣😂🤣
She looks like Adele
Omg guys, i understand that you are  huge fans, i been there before in my teen years, thinking that you know everything about your favorites artits and you have the right to complain about the choices that they made, saying horrible things about their partners just because you don't like them. I hope you can grow up and realize that first of all you are treating people this way and making assumptions of how they are, becouse you dont know both of them , and please stop putting artist in pedestals is okey if you like their art but its not right to be everywhere trying to defend them for any reason becouse... they really dont care about anything you a trying to say. its really toxic being in that kind of fandoms situations, but the positive thing is that is part of living and you gonna be out of this in a time on, listening your favorite artist and thinking how stupid you were
This woman is fucking hilarious! I stumbled onto this by accident but was genuinely impressed by her tone and wit.
Amelia tore this sleazebag to shreds and sent him away feeling every bit as stupid as he looked. Nice work.
why is this so funny
Forget 1975, bro’s starting to look like he was born in 1965
one of the best ones so far
This had me ROLLING
He is so greasy
this guy is so disgustingly into his own ego and incredibly insecure in the worst way possible. the ending made me realize how crap of character he really is. his whole trying to kiss her was pathetic.
It just unsettles me how much he looks like Corey Feldman. Can't unsee it. Is Matt 100% sure beyond shadow of a doubt who his father is?
He probably makes Taylor laugh all the time. I get now why she is with him !
this conversation is a whole meme
I stopped breathing at ‘I can reach’
Taylor swift chicken shop date WHEN 😂
hahahahahah LOOOOOOOL
So,  did you actually go out with Eitch ? He asked a really good question there
I think i kinda love her for this...
I wish I could see this whole bit from start to finish - when he walked in to wrapping.
Girl was thinking about it 😅
''It looks like you're going to a funeral'' ''maybe I am'' XD
girl, you'll never believe who he's buying iron supplements for now...
He for real wanted to kiss her, nobody can tell me otherwise
" School is annoying ". I find him very annoying.
I find Amillia arrogant and her questions are stupid!
4:24 this aged well
This made my day😂✨
I feel like Michael Bluth, Taylor is George Michael and Matty is Egg I mean Ann.
Or some gloves😂
If he’s dating Taylor Swift love really is a lie
Crazy thing is that she actually awkwardly flirted here - and he gave it back! 😩😄
Awkward and both similar humours
so taylor’s into this huh
A match made in heaven 😂😂
this is so awkward i loved every second of it
She is being deliberately confrontational .. he’s just reacting to the vibe
“I’m in love with you” 👀
ew.
4:24 EVERGREEN ADVICE - but also to be fair, Matt Healy could also just not make racist jokes 👀
When he started listing things he's invented ☠
Why date Taylor when you could have Amelia.
They have similar sense of humor.. worthy opponent!
"2023 I'm going to be even more slutty." **Late May 2023: Amelia reporting from every red carpet and featured in all the periodicals**
How many of you are watching this after hearing about him dating Taylor Swift?
i think i watch this once a week
Why don’t you buy me some iron supplements 😂
I love how she didnt kiss him  The power move
awokawok🤣 i cant stop laughing because looking him
So gotta be honest- only watching this because I’m a Taylor fan and I’m curious about this dude. But I think this is a good rep of his sense of humor that some people may take the wrong way . I can see the appeal
Okay I hate to say that but he's cute
LOL FOREHEAD KISS
😂😂 I like these two together. Finally someone that puts her in check. 😆
Too good 😂
Did he actually say he’s only into hot girls and then proceed to call her a slut? I literally cannot
I’m late to the party, just discovered her a few days ago and she’s hysterical. She makes me laugh so much.  Also, I’d love to go to London and eat here, not for anything else just the chicken shop.
Taylor swift 😮
@4:38 😂❤ “Did you just try n touch me?” Lol
He is a racist piece of shit. Thank god he got the Sid from Ice Age face to go with that personality
I can't believe I use to find him attractive as a teen
"Maybe I am." He got that from Walk the Line 😊
love MATTY... he is awesome
I only watched this because of the lewis capaldi one and im wondering how much of this is his genuine personality?! It's brilliant!
4:25 lol didn't age well
I had high hopes for this after his Adam Friedland Show appearance, but this was so unbelievably tepid and unracist. Smh.
This is cinema
This is the BEST!
best so far
He gives me the ick so much
Im sorry… did I miss something in the history of earth? Why do people like this? This is the second video of this show I’ve tried to watch and I swear I cannot get past 2 mins and thats me at my very highest maximum capacity for cringe and discomfort in a completely unappealing way…. Like wha. I’m probably one of the most open minded people on earth… able to understand most things and types of humor and I simply CANNOT digest this… this is horribly painful to watch. Why are there millions of people here? What’s going on?!?
Oh Tay Tay… no 😭
I absolutely f loved this
She is fabulous.
Hilarious 😂
And this guy is dating Taylor Swift??? Wow, ok.
he’s repulsive
“Dr. Marten’s, beach ball, sandwiches. I’m an innovator.”- lmao
“Or some gloves.” had me rolling!
He is a walking, flashing, screaming, crying RED FLAG
Ohh his accent... I get it now
Taylor Swift entered the chat room.
Taylor swift brought me here 🤓
I wont him
2:50 that dududu really gets me 😂anyone?
"Beach ball" 😂😂😂
"Or gloves" lmao
3:35
"why don't you buy me some iron supplements" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
this man is a weasel
Rewatching this is so much funnier than I remember it to be hahaha
He really wanted a kiss😂 when he licked his lips 🚮😭😂😂😂😂
High art or high infidelity*
He’s like baby David Gahan
was he with taylor when this happened. i can't compute until I know. thanks
He's so annoying
She’ll share his cigarette BUT NOT KISS HIM?!
No wonder he likes Taylor Swift.
He really should’ve taken the advice about not starting a podcast.
I'm super curious if anyone got the Johnny Cash reference at the beginning ❤️ but I also don't wanna scroll for my entire life and try to find someone who did 😂💯
pov: taylor rn
what the fuck is that one piece of hair
Getting major rapist vibes from matthew
I feel like people really are not seeing right through him and how he’s clearly playing a role of a jackass just to piss off people
so apparently Taylor Swift watched it too
ick
5:55 ha said about tumblr, dr.Martins which he once talked about them at his concert yrs ago (and that time, he mentioned Taylor Swift)  Is this a clue?
Weirdly  the 1975 released a song named I'm in love with you 8 months ago
Not handsome.
who here after finding out Taylor is dating him 😭
Plz taylor bring back joe t9il el 9lb w olm3da matsrtch plz go back to joe I'm begging 😭😭
Yarbi tsm7 lia had wjh zapa mea Taylor 😭
He is so smarmy
I about spit out my milk when she said " Why don't you buy me some iron." 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Me visiting this video to see a glimpse of what Taylor and his dates would be like
Guys please dont speak for taylor.. i mean he makes good pop music, similar to taylor so they probably bond on that. And maybe he treats her really well.. just please dont judge him based on his looks.. and in this interview he seems fine..i dont see anything horrible abt him
"Did you actually go out with Aitch?" SCREAMING
What does Taylor Swift see in this guy?
Oh yay a predator. Glad she swerved him tbh
The genius part 😂
never in a million years did i think taylor and matty would be seriously romantically linked wtaf is going on and what in Gods name did joe do lmao
what an odd man
This will never be not funny to me. 😂
he's soo.... yeah
so fun
Pov : you're here after all the Taylor Swift rumors
I have watched this way too many times!  I love it!
Mattress Healy is and will always be a player
this man’s always trying to kiss everyone what’s up w that 😭
He sounded like kit fucking harigton the king of the north himself lol
ok but imagine alex turner on this, that would be hilarious
I bet he wishes he took her advice to not do a podcast now.
Who else came here after hearing the rumors he's dating Taylor Swift?
I come here when I'm sad
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I can't believe he is who he is given how seemingly normal his parents are.
Matty 1 million percent understood the assignment and over delivered.... My favourite date by a lot!
I AM WAITING FOR HARRY STYLES
I laughed so hard at the low iron comment. I always have cold hands and have low iron too lol
Aquarius vibes.
he needs to take a bath
Why British man are so hot ???!
People judging someone they love for dating someone they think they know is weird. Maaaaybe she just might know him better than you do, you know, cos, she knows him irl
I was born in the 80s, in 1989 and I am relevant.  Yasss, Matt. Yasss. 😅
He’s so mf creepy.
do machine gun kelly lol
The strength it took it not kiss 😂
Girl shoulda kissed him 😭
WHAT DOES TAYLOR SEE IN HIM?!?!
Of course this is on my recommended, now. 😂
How is no one talking about how she said NO 5 times and was clearly uncomfortable and he kept insisting on kissing her? Wtf
Like this if you’re here trying to understand why Taylor Swift sees in this man
Why is the chemistry actually so good
Amelia vs Taylor… yesss
3:28 “this is quite meta, this is kinda high art.”   this video is high art
“That’s a turn off” 😂😂😂😂
i-i would've kissed him
Taylor Swift 🧣🧣🧣
Who is here after the Taylor rumours?
The way I giggled like a school girl the ENTIRE video
Problematic Matt
How is he 34? He looks 50
Still the best one
He sheat girl... I'm sorry
Why am i sweating when he says "i can reach you"
So i find myself commenting on every video that this is my favorite chicken shop date But this one is For real
Or some gloves 😅😅
He is so hard to read
This guy has really strange eyes. Something is off. Watch out Taylor!
Or some gloves 😅
I don't give a shit about Taylor Swift, but finding out she might be dating Matt helped me realise what an ass he is lol
I love Amelia 😂❤😂❤😂
I really hope this is just a character and not his actual personality. As if this is actually how he is he's kinda horrible and puts everyone else down lol.
I loved this 😄❤
I am here 12.05.23 :D
I have literally seen this six times.  Classic.  Irony is not dead!
Love him but like OMG he looks like shit in this interview.
He really reminds me of Trig!
HE WAS BORN IN 1989 👀👀👀👀
stepdad scares me sometimes
Matt is too cool, solid idea to have gotten him on : )
she has the girl on “ we end of the fucking world “ energy
Matty face when he caught Amelia is smoking HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH
Omg Amelia, how does it feel knowing that kiss you rejected is now Taylor Swift's? 😱  😂😂😂
He low key looks like Travis Kalanick.
WHO IS HERE AFTER THE TAYLOR MATT RUMORS
Ironic that he thinks the worst part about him is his personality when it's literally what makes him attractive lol
Have seen this date embarrassing amount of times!!😩
She really is an awful lot of fun. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Is he going to move that piece of hair over his eye
This is my favorite video so far
He was totally going in for the kiss to at the end 😂😂
the bit about all the things he invented reminds me so much of that one "mick mouse" scene in new girl
This has to be one of my favorites
what do you think your least attractive traits? - my personality HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
Why did it have to end?!??
I'm straight, but I swear Matty got like 10% hotter with the smoke lol
PLEASE HAVE HIM BACKKKK
He looks like Kevin Jonas’ underdeveloped twin whose parents locked up in the attic without a toothbrush.
Who is “h”?
HE'S ALSO BORN IN 1989???????????? AND HE MENTIINED IT????
why is youtube recommending this to every swiftie now. algorithm is crazy
BUY BUY BUY! Amelia's sloppy seconds.
i had no idea who he was and swifty brought me here... ive got such bad ick from this man ... eeeee
When he reached over the table to kiss her 😭
Found footage of Taylor Swift and Matty trying to date
This is the best video on the internet
who else is baffled by taylor liking this... dude?! (!)
watching because my girl tay is hanging w him. Doing research lmao
holy shit this is FUNNY
2:50 freaky friday battle of the bands style
suddenly this is trending hehehehhehe taylorrrrrr
The cigarette is the funniest thing I’ve seen in a while
When I've had a bad day I watch this interview again 😅😅
love this ep so much
the most hilarious episode ever
Who’s here for Taylor Swift?!!!
He was also born in 1989🙃
Omg the kilig when they started to talk about the kiss and when he tried to reach her 🥹
i think jamie lee curtis is behind the stage playing guitar for him
….aaaaand he is off the market…
he is such an Aries
This guy is the most attractive not really good looking guy ever. And funny. He has great comedic timing for a musician. And she is great  too. This was YouTube gold.
Guys he wasn't kidding when he said he liked hot girls 👀
Hilarious!!
heehee
Taylor Swift sent me here.
i was squealing like a pig when he wanted to kiss her
She has a PhD in Banter
I'm back here after the Taylor Swift rumors
I'm rewatching this after the news broke out of Matt and Taylor swift. I guess she has high iron😂
I could watch 2 hours of them doing this.
So GIRLS!
Who's here after taylor swift...
he’s so fine
Trying to understand why Tay is dating him? so many red flags 😫 😩
Omg never thought I'd love this so much...... A bit too much actually that I never wanted it to end.........
This is the funniest thing i have seen in years
Anyone else revisit this after the news he's with Taylor? 🤣😭
Best lyric easy: "You lack substance when you say something like "Oh, what a shame." it's just a self referential way to stop you having to be human." The entire song from dissonant trumpet notes and disjoint time measures is the most brilliant song I've experienced.
He is just as weird as she is 😊
The Adam Friedland Show was the pinnacle of this man's career.
"or some gloves" is one of the best lines I've heard in my life PHAHAHA
hes so yuck and cringe
the podcast foreshadowing in this episode genuinely shocked me
Just realising i really dont like matt healy. He's awful. Amelia was hilarious in this though 😂❤
I feel like you both should date in real life, I felt the sparks too ✨️
You’ve gotta enjoy your life 😂😭
I imagine that as an interview host, being compared to Nardwuar must be like being compared to a religious messiah
only amelia can make me voluntarily watch a video with matty in it 💀
Beach ball
I think he blocked me on Instagram the other day and I got upset but it is what it is I will always and have always loved MATTY!! And the 1975!! I remember when MATTY first downloaded Snapchat and he didn’t know how to make it private , he was answering video calls and I was one of the lucky people that got to talk to him for a very short 3 minutes but I’ll never forget.. thank you 😂❤
😂😂😂
When he said I can reach, I’m fabblergasted
PLEASE GET ALEX TURNER❤
I really want Arctic monkeys on this show❤❤❤❤
Es lie nahdwaa ennit.
I don’t want to kiss you  wHhyY- SENT ME
Or some gloves HAD ME CACKLING
HAHAHAHAHAHHAGAGAG
I couldn't love this more... pls do Paul Mescal!
"Did you actually go out with Aitch"   Important xD
love reading all the comments
love reading all the comments
I love their chemistry 🥺
God he’s so fine
Why did this make me not like him LMAO
they both really funny :)
Quick thinking when she kissed his forehead and sat back down! HAHAHAHAH that stopped him. And the fake cigarettes just twisted the knife that was already deep in his heart xD
Funny that he said she's like Nardwuar with the gifts, I thought that myself.
the first person to ever reject a kiss from matty
Amelia..you start the date by being this intriguing hot girl that guys want to know and like. This like keeps a guys attention and the challenge is intriguing...Even after the failed smoke, Matty is still in your trance. Then you give him the kiss on the forehead...a sign of disrespect (like family like your kissing a brother) and it's over...over no second date
Beach ball… sandwiches
yikes
Omg guys:D you made me laugh so hard!🤣
I love him<3
I am in love with this woman
The end reminded me of how predatory he acts with his young/possibly underage fans at his concerts
immediately at the beginning when he said "this is like Nardwaur", I verbally went "this guy knows his SHIT!"
The “don’t smoke” lesson made me laugh.
Never knew awkward + awkward = Chemistry hahaha
This is the best one! loved it!
this is the best chicken shop date, i did not expect that!
I just keep playing 3:23 over and over pretending it's me.
that "that's pathetic" has a whole separate fan base
I love how he's like "I find you attractive" and she's like "cool I'm going to continue roasting you" 😂
Ever since that thing that happened between him and YUNGBLUD I’ve hated him ever since
The way it cuts after he asks about Aitch 😂
not him coppying taylor being born in 1989
Can't stop smiling... this is truly high art.
Tell me why the last kiss bit of this gives me like tumblr era badboy fan fiction vibes
damn i also like the I'm in love with you song just so good and real
hes so good sometimes i dont understand wherther hes joking
i watch this video at least 3 times a week
Still her best date ever🙌🏼
this was so good
STAY AWAY FROM HER
She fell in love at 3:16
He's a knob
Thumbnail look like drake bell
I loved the banter back n forth
You had a chance to kiss Matty and you didn't?  Bruh.
Best guest
Is this like Between Two Ferns?
I really think you should consider him....this video was just cute and awkward but still cute.....I think you should but give it a chance
I enjoyed this one until Matty was essentially trying to force Amelia to kiss him. The fact he still kept on pushing it after she said no. Very rapey, even if it is all for bants and comedy. Not the one.
Matty is just plain cool.
what does she say at 7:12?
Amelia sweetheart I am still waiting for Ross to be on this channel too plssssss 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Oh dear, he thinks he's a genius but he's so, so stupid. Dunning-Kruger in practice
"why don't you buy me some iron supplements" Matty "or some gloves"  😂
I'm confused. WTF lol
Her: "Why don't you buy me some iron supplements..." Him: "...or some gloves" 😭😭
I love the Nardwuar reference! It's exactly what was going through my mind at that moment.
It's embarrassing the amount of times I've watched this lol
Low Iron : turn off😂
She is amazing at this
1:47 that smile is the turning point for him, completely different energy after that and he's locked into her after she drops 1 flirty line 🥺🥺🥺 suddenly hes asking about Aitch and twirling his hair omg this date is so cuuuuute
The whole time I am like how is that damn hair not bothering him 😂😂 it’s literally in his eye
Liz Trust…
When he said he was an Aries I knew he was born on the same exact day as my husband and I just found out, he was. Weird
Do you carry a moleskin around with you? You look like you do....
That fryer grease is nasty. It needs to be replaced.
Im still waiting for the second date Amelia!❤
this was so british it actually colonized my phone.
He reminds me of Nicolas from the vampire diaries
Why is she so mean?
Gives off the doctor vibes
pathetic 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Every so often I come back to this video and I'm not 100% sure why
Gosh...this was bad. Even Amelia knows it
He looks like a young trigger
which was more culturally significant? the Renaissance or ...
fake cigarette😂
he looks so unfortunate
7:30 Matt licking his lips to prep for the kiss 🥵🔥 how Amelia denied that kiss I will never know!!!
I love this so much 😂
amelia’s rizz is unparalleled
So thrilled to see matty here!!!!
I literally always feel like watching this I love it sooo much it’s hilarious mattys hilarious too 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂
Damn! He only likes hot girls! No chance here! 😂
BYE I SHIP THEM SO BAD
Dude is an overrated buffoon
Ive watched this at very least once a day since it came out 😋  update: i can recite this whole video word by word now
Gosh, i get she's doing a bit and so that's why she didn't kiss him but.. if Matty Healy suggested a kiss i would have simply been like fine if you insist lol 😂
I've watched this way too many times but it still doesn't feel enough. Matty has me so captivated. I'm obsessed.
5:25 "This is kinda like your slut era." "Well, I actually think 2023 I'm gonna be more slutty." "Wow."
4:29 amelia telling him to not do a podcast has never been so relevant
I love him
the forehead kiss was so cute lmao
4:23 ✨E x a c t l y✨🫴🏻
I love the UK, such a beautiful country, and many people are very fashionable. However, I am disappointed in him. He mentioned so racist things towards Japan. I don’t want this racist to visit Japan ever. I don’t care if he hates Japan, but please don’t come to Japan matt.
Or gloves 😂
Idk if I just live under a rock but I just discovered your page and I don’t think I have ever enjoyed something on YouTube more in my life. So yeah, thanks 😅
Lol bro WHO THE HELL IS H 😂
I've watched this an unhealthy amount of times
imagine saying you’ve turned down kissing matty healy like what a flex
racist matty healy
The kiss on the forehead I can’t
I really don’t know how many times I’ve watched this 😂❤
Gloves with the finger tips cut off
Somebody Else one of my favorite songs
racist👎👎👎
Fucking racist lmao
What was the drink in the bottle at the beginning
I LOVE THESE TWO TOGETHER 😂.I’ve been cheesy grinning this whole vid. Very cute.
Alex Turner when
1:04 i love how they both squint their eyes like that. starting to think it's a British thing
Did she kiss him in his forehead 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
hey Matt! i just want to say that you are an incredible human being, so open and loveable. just seeing you kiss Marcus from that morningshow in Norway, during that impro-interview had me laughing so hard! no one else coulda done that... real human being.
reminds me that Jim Jarmush movie: coffee and cigarettes
you should 100% have naurdwaur on
6:14 IM DYING HSHDJDJSJA
It's giving that interview with Jesse Eisenberg but better
“you’re an aries” “..oh god.” CACKLING
Need a second date!
Does Amelia rent out the chicken shop to film these?
Hi Amelia! I don't know if you read this but nevertheless I wanted to let you know that I downloaded a popular dating app for the first time and I am on a hunt for love as I am still as young and relevant like Matty. Wish me luck!
Something about them sharing the cigarette sends me over the edgggeeee IM SO JEALOUS
Just back for my weekly rewatch don’t mind me
When his kiss was being denied I felt like I was in Amelia’s mind going through the Pros and Cons of my next action and what to do. GOOD MOVE W THE FOREHEAD KISS
At the end the flow was so beautiful about the inventions - It was so perfect
Amelia when you okay the guitar IDK but I just almost cried from laughing ! Funny ass BIT
Matty calling this her slut era made me laugh so loud.
Ok but if matty asked me to kiss I would’ve folded
what’s the drink he loves?
"So you were born in 1975" ". . . No"
check that absolute clueless prick , if you like seeing him look like a total toby check him on the Adam Friedland show even Adam takes him for a walk, the cunt from the 1975 calls himself genius and not a hint of irony CRINGY ooooooohhh
WAAAAAAAAANNNNNKKKKKEEEEEERRRRRR, I SWEAR there aint a wanker motion big enough !!!!!
Shocked he didn't say anything racist or ignorant
Lesson for you don’t smoke 😂😂😂
the gloves part HAHAHAHAHA
Ahhhh i wish I was hot enough for matty 😂😢😂
very cute! love this concept
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like I like you
Maybe, just maybeee if there's a chance amelia would do a date with alex turner.
this is the best date i´ve never been on
Woooooow this was awesome
„i was born in 1989 and i’m still young and i’m still relevant” “😀 sure…. 😅”  literally gen z to every millennial
She was contemplating that kiss 😭
This guy wants to kiss everyone
“No I don’t want to kiss you “  “Why ?”😩😩
I've never seen Amelia before but I am entranced and charmed, thoroughly. That little twitchy eye thing she does when she says "so what, so, you're not available??" made me smitten.
THEYRE LIKE THE SAME AND I LOVE IT
Who is H!!
I love so much this date 😏
i don’t like how they don’t eat as much as they used to do before😡😡
the silence when they held hands is comedic gold and the low iron thing right after GOD this is so funny
How could she really have said no that many times to his offer to kiss. Like wow. Will-power at its finest.
He needs to move his hair out his eye, then I can enjoy this to its full extent.
Pure genius
lol that's bonkers. Love it!!
This is still my favorite chicken shop date
Just coming back to this video every once in a while
He's 100% gonna be found out to be a nonce in a few years, one of the creepiest dudes around atm with so many questionable videos around
Just in time for Valentine's. Hope lovers come together today💘
Thank you
I love the amount of pure English sarcasm in this video
LMAOOOOOOOOOO
I’m crying at Matty’s free spirited ass actually wanting to kiss 😭😭🤭
‘…..or some gloves’
“Why don’t you buy me some iron supplements”✨
At 3:15 she fell in love
I need more videos with his voice
How did she have the strength to not kiss him. Omg I could never
OMG I LOVE IT
This is the best one I would watch them all day
That strand of hair really annoys me
4:24
AHAHAHAHA THAT WAS AMAZING
She said she has low iron 😂😂😂
This is my neighbourhood 😱. Oh my god, i would have stood outside screaming if I'd known.
god i love that matty healy
"Why don't u buy me some iron, iron supplements?💅🏻" "or gloves"💀
"i can reach..." kills me every time ^^
4:24 I think he should steer clear of podcasts lol
his favourite drink is literally the one everyone ik gags at EVERYTIME I drink it
"I'm an elevator."
4:25 lol. lmao
“Do u carry around a moleskin?”
Looks like he didn't take the advice
His quiet “oh god” after she mentioned him being an Aries was EVERYTHING 😂 3:35
I avoided watching this one for ages for some reason, maybe cause he's in a band?! But this may be the funniest one I've seen.
The whole cigarette segment was so hilarious😂😂
when asia
Or some gloves 🤣🤣
Amelia giving a peck to his head after him trying to tempt her with a smooch was a POWER MOVE, idc what anyone says...😏🥵
The kiss on the forehead hahahahahahahahaha
I could actually sense sparks here
I love this man! Such an inspiration
This made me laugh so hard 😂
Amelia is just british Nardwuar
This might’ve been the best one yet
these commenrs r pissing me off none of them understand british/european satire
the part when she said I have low iron I lost it loll
I watch British comedians, Taskmaster, 8O10C, etc… and I _thought_ I was beginning to understand British humour. This felt more like it was exposing that guy as a horrible person while disguised as romantic satire.
“you’re an aries..” lmao
Not him being creepy and pushing for a kiss
"I wouldn't invite you unless I was literally in love with you"😂
He looks like a Jonas brother with extra chromosomes.
Amelia found her match they should just date for real
Great match
idk how all the comments are so positive, he gave me the ick from start to finish
The fact that I've seen hate comments on tiktok saying "Matty was so pretentious in that chicken shop interview" like if you can't see any satire in this video that's tragic, glad these comments pass the vibe check
The mini IT crowd
I know his fans are going to kill me for this but matty healy gives me HORRIBLE vibes he’s so creepy
the B roll is amazing
im fuckin OBSESSED w her
When he said "did you actually go. Out with aitch..." I hope that wasn't scripted 😩☠️👀😁 and mentioning drake and basically calling her a slut 😭😭😭😂😂😂
Nearly forgot to watch this today
I don’t get why people like him he’s so awkward and gives off perv vibes
I don’t get why people like him he’s so awkward and gives off perv vibes
this video shows me a close up of how my sims talk
SImply delightful, why did it have to end? When I need some joy, I'm watching this....
Is this an attempt at humour ?
I like prices of all of them chickens (e.g. £4.99)
i cant believe that matty healy was in fucking cricklewood
Mason Mount should be on here 😂
6:20 really got me
I don’t like how he didn’t take no for an answer >:(
that kiss killed me haha
Picture an interview like this with Tyler Joseph
Is her head abnormally large in this?
This conversation is the equivalent of being stranded it the outback....the extremely dry atmosphere the drudgery of trudging through the same back drop for what seems like hours...the occasional mirage of something more genuine....one or two leaf trees to keep moral up....I guess the only thing its lacking is any kind of heat...so I guess artic circle then instead
Her heart beat must have beaten quickly when matty get close to her face ❤
Anyone else feeling uncomfortable about the straight up sexual assualt at the end. Imagine putting someone in that predicament on camera. Distatesful 🤮
“you’re an aries” “…oh god”  me
7:34 Amelia was so cute
Surprised Matty didn't ask to see ID before asking for a kiss.
idk what's up w me but this is my 5th time rewatching this, its beginning to be a habit
Oh Ameliarrrr, you SLAY me!🤣
This is just so ridiculous I'm obsessed  "I've got low iron" "that's a turnoff" "you should buy me some iron supplements" "or some gloves"
Finally someone who can out-talk Matt.
I hate this guy? Low iron? Wear gloves.
He’s not one bit attractive
He's so annoying
He's got swag for days! He seems very dialed in. Hope he's not a F%ck boy. He could be huge!
Me sitting here praying for a part 2
i lost my shit when it went black & white with the cigarette.
This is my least favourite Matty Healy interview
This guy could play a young trigger.
shes the worst
Please go on a date with Alex Turner lol
This is defo the first time Amelia is punchin.
hes such a perv
he is begggging for a kiss
This was genuinely the funniest date 😭
The perfect date :two witties flirting with each other
This show is so unfunny
i wouldve done anything.
Reminds me of Ezra miller lol
His reaction to, "you're an Aries" was relatable.
him listing things he “invented” reminds me of the scene in New Girl where Schmitt is on a date with Nadia and naming things she likes about America😂😂😂
“do you carry a Moleskin around with you? you look like you would” HAHAHA
matty healy saying to be serious you’re quite attractive would’ve killed me. I would need an ambulance
I need u to know this took me licherally from the day this came out until right this very instant to watch it because I knew it would give me second hang embarrassment and it did.... and I love. you.... not him
He is so greasy I'm sorry
No I'm not nervous I have low iron 😂😂😂
"D'ya carry around a mole skin with ya?"  "... ... ... I actually do... yeah"   Wall to wall bangers, this video
"... Exaaactly"   This guy hurts my brain 😂
When he groaned at her for mentioning that he's an Aries, I felt that.
My word, the rocker lifestyle is starting to take its toll! He’s looking a lot like his dad already 😂
he tries so hard to be funny i get second hand embarrassment.. 😭
Matty is hilarious!!!! Very clever.
In order to volunteer for 10+ hours a week, you need to be able to afford it.  This is the Universal Basic Income. Let’s give volunteers a guaranteed minimum income of  $1,500ish USD/month.  So they can make our communities better. Nine
this is like watching modern day Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne
Can someone tell me the most common font close to what they're using in the video? I have a tattoo with a similar font and would love to know the name for future tattoos!
Matty is "the one". Sooooo cute.
Ion know if it’s just me but this Matty guy hiki creeps me out
7:17 "no I can't--I don't want to kiss you" is disappointed professional Amelia slipping up and disinterested character Amelia barely making the save
how did I not know he was british lmao
bro looks like frodo
Amelia: You can buy me some iron supplements.. Matty: ..or some gloves  I am beyond dead😂😂 I felt that so much
Not until 7:30 did i find this man attractive in my whole life maybe i just wasn’t paying attention 😅
Why didn't you kiss him??? Nutter!
This is a thing not in North America
Okay, I must have been living under a rock to have never seen a Chicken Shop Date before.  I'm stuck at 1:35, watching it on repeat.😂This is the best.  Amelia, you are a genius.
best video to ever exist
yes
Why does everyone simp for this man, I literally do not get it
I come back here every once in a while, I love this date!
One of the best ones yet haha
Healy is such a sleazy little weirdo.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's so dry i needed 2 l bottle of water after i watched this.  Genious.
I've been thinking about this for a while now but he looks like the rat in flushed away
he’s a weirdo bro
She’s so cute
I shall call him Spike. I want this guy to play the new Spike if there is a Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot.
I love how he just processes the whole concept of the show real time and flips it on it's head, and she plays with it so well.
I choked when she said i just hace low iron 😂😂😂
I fucking love this interview
Did you actually date Aitch 😂😂😂
He seemed genuinely upset that she turned down the kiss
Who is H ?
im screaming
“I can reach” had me like -
i just an't.  its too much.  love it.
I'm so confused did that go well or not
This woman is not funny and shouldn't be perpetuated so heavily by our stupid media outlets
Does anyone else think that every 1975 song sounds the same?
Anyone who calls themselves 'Matty' and is a middle class tosser who thinks he is rock and roll.. please take a step forward
Surprised he's hilarious
i’m back here again living vicariously through amelia
Kind of like High Art Well, dating me is an art💚  Why don’t you buy me some iron supplements?
@3:25 - How is this 'meta'? genuinely dont understand how it can be defined as such
He said “I can reach”
This is probably the best episode
Amelia, we need Matty back as soon as possible please.
Her negging extremely famous people and getting away with it and cracking them is jusssssttttt ahhhhh it’s amazing
I’m obsessed with her for real
Why do people like this guy
“Why don’t you buy me some iron supplements” or “some gloves” killed me 😂😂😂😂
He’s so scary
I’m not nervous. I have low iron 🤣🤣🤣
yooo they're actually flirting lmaoo
He's a legend. You already know.
I like how she paid homage at 6:22
is that olivia rodrigo eating chicken on the wall
honestly, i need longer episodes please. its too good
why can't he resist the urge to ask literally everyone to kiss him? /rh
LMFAO this is so fucking funny
why is this the best thing i’ve ever watched
"low iron?! well that's a turnoff."
hahhaha Amelia bottled it under the kiss pressure
Why hasn't anyone made a compilation of CHICKEN SHOP DATE's flirtiest moments yet?
oh the kiss bit was foreshadowing huh
That strand on hair belongs to Zayn and it looks much better on him than Matty
they are the perfect combo of awkward 😂
He's such an Aries.
“I’m an innovator” … *chip*
He was genuinely attracted to her
1:08
She has met her match. He desolved her whole personality
This was a delight to watch!
I finally realised who she looks like
The beginning of her saying you look like your dressed for a funeral and him saying maybe I am. Was very Johnny Cash. Also after he mentioned H it felt like the cook was coming for him. Lol
Omg battle of who hate flirts the hardest
Can you buy me iron…. Iron supplements.
Amelia,  "I love you".
Those prices aren't that bad. I am confused about why they are called "chips" on one poster and "fries" on another when it's the same thing.
this is pure genious, and Matty just adding
Matty: “I’m still young and relevant” Amelia: “… Sure.”
- Mom, can I have Michael Hutchence? - We have Michael Hutchence at home   Michael Hutchence at home: …  🤭 he cute though
Ahhwhy did I think it was Kevin Jonás is the thumbnail ?
so your'e an aries....... his reaction is so good
say what ya like, he's a closer haha!
Matty Healy is a portentous bastard and he singlehandedly ruined my life.
"It's like Nadwar" haha
She was fighting the urge not to kiss him
Shows just how uninteresting they are as people
he would make a good villian who is just sick and tired of everything
the ''slut era'' and everything abt this video is soo funny- lovee itTT
This is supremely brilliant is so many ways 😄
He actually wanted to kiss her 😭😭😭
She looks like one of the mice from flushed away
did i just fall in love with this girl?
I woulda kissed him but that’s only after he talked about his writing process.
Best date. Out of all of them
A minute to appreciate her 🔥👌👍🏼
you make me genuinely laugh harder than anyone else
One of the best interviews
oh no i might be becoming a matty healy girlie
I think the date would rather well
okay favorite episode after doing a marathon of all of them, their sense of humor meshes so well, i wish there were part 2’s of these fr bc i never wanted this one to end it’s too funny
"or some gloves" AHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
His pushy “ let’s kiss” moves were kinda annoying.  She said no, said didn’t want to, said she’s too far away.. but he kept going. When she kisses him on the forehead ( which was pretty classy)  he makes a snarky comment about her.. I don’t know man.. like he was trying to be funny.. but just came off a bit creepy IMO.
If these two are single they should definitely date
Hearing him saying he’s straight after watching every angle of him kissing a male fan on stage twice 😂
She needs to do a video of just the outtakes from every interview, there must be more!
Amelia please invite the guy who plays Ivan in History Channels Vikings, Alex! Check him out
So obsessed with your interview skills
best date ive ever seen
Amelia, absolutely lethal :D
PTDRRRR vrmt une star cette meuf et avec matty c'est parfait pour le concept
ptdrrrr c'est tellement absurde et cringe mais j'aime bcp ce type d'humour, matty jtm
This guy must be one of Nick Cave’s Bad Seeds.
Lmao this is gold! Hahaha!  “Or some gloves” 😂🤣
she better than me bc I would’ve folded on site
He looks like Jake from 2 1/2 Men. The older version of Jake.
THE MOLESKIN! Amelia. Love it.
Funniest interview by far
when she lit a cigarette
I think i just watched the best chicken shop date 😂😂😂 HILARIOUS!!
He needs his hard drives checked
Wtf is this interview!? 🤣
This was superb
Sorry but this dude is annoying af
"so you're an aries" "oh goawd" He was genuinely disappointed lmao
Might’ve been worth ending the show for this love story 💕
NARDWUARRRRRR YAAAS dootdootdalootdoot
Ew why is Matt Healy obsessed with getting girls to kiss him? She literally said "no" like seven times and he leaned in anyway. What a creepo!
The baby girl hair twirl got me xD
top scientists are still trying to figure how it’s possible that this woman denied Matty Healy begging for a kiss
Amelia: “I actually think, 2023, I’m gonna be even more slutty.”  Matty: “…wow”  Matty internally: I have to step up my game this year. I need to be even sluttier than Amelia. I can’t let her win
this was the start of his kissing era
5:01 “Why don’t you buy me some low iron supplements”  “Or some gloves” LMAOOOO
He loves kissing people hahahaha
Amelia resisting that kiss, true aquarian🥲
is there an episode with ziwe?
The fact he asked if she actually went out with aitch
"What do you think is your least attractive trait?" "probably my personality" "Mmmm yeah."  she ain't holding back lol I love her.
Any other Americans looking at these menus and thinking "Damn, these places look pretty good..." ? Haha.
This was incredible 😂
One of my special skills that I can do😂
They have the exact same energy 😂
I opened up a tab to watch porn but this was way too intriguing to exit without completing.
"you're an Aries"  "oh god....."   instant respect for The 1975
im kinda sad he repeatedly ignored her saying no to a kiss
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Matty
“I have low iron” “Well that’s a turn off” Cryinggggggg
Hang on, his dad is Tim Healy, right?
this was the funniest one for me lmaoooo
"Why don't you buy me some iron" " or some gloves" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Whos H?
"You have low iron? That's a turnoff" 🤣🤣
Theres a split second when she moves towards him where he actually thinks shes going to kiss him and you can see it on his face and my life revolves around that 4th of a second
him earnestly trying to sleep with her the whole time really just sums up the 1975's whole vibe
What an Aries 💀
I feel like I wasn’t supposed to watch this 😹 idk why I feel like a voyeur in this one
This made me smile..
would love a part 2
he gives me the ick
3:35 this is perfect 😂
how in the earth can you reject a matty´s kiss
Chicken shop??? 😨😫chicken babies are minced to death in millions in the dairy chicken industry. Vegan for life!
British Amber Heard?
"what do you think is your least attractive trait?" "probably my personality" LOL
'I've got low iron.' ... 'We'll thats a turn off' ... bloody funny.
He looks a bit like Dave Gahan from Depeche Mode
Matty healy is a predator disguised as an ally to women. Look up his history with underage girls. They literally have a song about not being able to hook up with 17 year old girls, but as dennis Reynolds said, "theres no faster way for people to think you are diddling kids, than to write a song about it." 4 out of 5 members of the 1975 have assault accusations against them, including their manager. Not to mention all the girls he's kissed without their permission. And that's just what's been made public. 🤷‍♂️
Fuck he is such a depressing person and the music is even worse 🙃
is this pointy, acerbic blonde a characature? Just jarring...why would anyone want to see her again?
They need to go on another date, they are really great together XD
i hope they've changed that fryer oil by now
My favorite radio station just played one of my favorite songs it’s called I’m in love with you by The 1975.
No way she refused the kissss
this is the ONLY interview i want the behind the scenes of😭😭
amelia denying a kiss and matty calling it “pathetic” explains him perfectly
i still cant comprehend how amelia was able to reject his kiss
Do you carry a moleskin... you look like you do 😂
I would pay good money to see the unedited version of this
so strange there's a poster if Matty in the music corridor at my school and apparently he went to the same school as me. even had the same geography teacher which is wierd
(me, coming back here two months later)  this man just loves kissing people I swear
es que school is annoying pero él más???
This literally cheers me up every time if I’m having a bad day/evening 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😅😅😅
They have the same ears
I like the way he made her feel awkward for once haha normally the other way round
"You look like you're going to a funeral."  "Maybe I am."  That's a Johnny Cash quote 🥹
God this could be a tv show, i love this
I’m in love with both of you now. Thanks.
There has never been a more gross and disgusting man anywhere ever
this was probably the first time matty was refused to being kissed. he got whiny. cutie.
The Masteress of Rizzary
Begging for a sequel
they would high key be perfect for each other. in a different world perhaps, but they would
I don't know this guy, everyone seems to think he's chill and this was just him going in on the bit, but that kiss was major Chris Isaak forcing himself on Cameron Diaz on stage vibes
"Tumblr was my idea" - Matty Healy, 2022
they have the same nose and easrs
Matty Healy is one of those people where you genuinely can't tell if they're being sarcastic or not
I hope they get married
Does no one else find him creepy
The slut era 😭😭😭😭
matty is right this is literally high art
Helloooooo
this was very charming to watch, including the end, to be honest. it's like a live romcom, I like it lol
“Please stop with the words”
Matt Healy = slimey vibes
An icon for denying that kiss
That long pause no was perfection ☠️☠️☠️ 7:33
She's a legend for resisting the kiss I would have dropped on the floor for Matty🙌🏻
Omg this girl...
The fact he was offended when he didn't want to kiss and wasnt asking but telling in front of cameras shows how he wants to market himself to younger girls
the johnny cash reference at the beginning <3 !!!!
Chicken funeral 🍗
Major eyelash batting going on at 1.35 😂
Took me till 40 seconds to realise I like this girls humour 😂
you know what if they ended up married i wouldnt be surprised. their chemistry is weird but i love it
Awkward as hell; loved it.
The reason Matty is kissing everyone on stage on this tour is bc Amelia wouldn’t kiss him
omfg... hats off to amelia for this one... what a fuckin legend for denying his ass a kiss lmaoo
This is my all time favourite chicken shop date
this is genius
Brilliant 🤣
so you were born in 1975 😂
He looks like violent chacki
I love British humor so much. This is how I imagine the "Are You Being Served?" Characters away from the store.
You look like you are going to a funeral - ''maybe I am'' .... Good Johnny Cash reference Matty 10/10 !!
he needs to be studied
this and jack harlow's are going to stay here remembered forever
how i love this man
i've watched this so many times
I have watched this an unhealthy amount of times…
date 2 when?
how could she not kiss him
One of your best! 😂
Her not kissing him, will forever haunt me.
The Nardwar reference really set the tone for this masterful conversation. I love it here.
2:13
the number of times i’ve watched this video is alarming but I laugh every time
Matty 😍😍😍
I need a part 2 to this one
The vibe is the same as matt smiths Doctor
“2023 THE SLUT ERA” love that 😂
ok i know this is a like a funny video and all but why did it feel kinda genuinely uncomfortable 😭😭 like not funny awkward but actually awkward.. he was making it kinda weird loool
I think this is my favourite one so far!!!! 😂😂😂💛
............
matty is normally so pretentious so i cant tell when its really him or when its the bit LMAO
Oh my god this is the best thing I’ve ever watched
Matty trying to understand what this actually is and then calling it “high art” killed me
“Low iron? That’s a turn off” I died
can someone tell me who H. is? i’m new here
This guy I find weirdly attractive 😂
These videos are my new favorite thing.
The sexual tension between the two…
Seriously thought that was Madchenamick
Mate if anyone else tried them Kiss they’d be Slandered for being a freak. It’s like when he started investigation a fans Id on whether he can kiss her or not, just Jesus man
He seems like such a boring guy. And also kind of douchey. Maybe he's just not used to this interview format. Maybe he tried to play a character. I really don't know.
2:17 guy looked right into the camera as he followed through. dominance
This man is desperately unfunny
This. Is. So. Good.
they match so well??????
Iv'e watched a few of these  .and my first and only comment .Amelia ,you are  lovely Sorry 🤦‍♂
Dave Gahan at home...
I was born in 1989 and I also hope that I’m still considered young and relevant
THE FACE 7:17
this man and woman are hilarious together.
What a tosser
He is pretty cute .
I think she was nervous!
2nd date!!
The chemistry bouncing off the walls I almost fainted
it’s funny how the only thing that really put matty off was watching  amelia waste a perfectly good cigarette
The thank you after the date hahahahahaha
that ending bit literally prefaced the latter half of tour with the robbers kisses omg
amelia stronger than me fr
This is brilliant
This is excellent! 😂
She wanted ti kiss sooooi badly
the way he just says "beach ball" i can't breathe
He’s a creep
Reminds me of cal the dragon
I wish she kissed him.
literally meant to be stfu
I’m cackling 😭
Omg .. I see now 😮‍💨 I see what the girlies were going crazy over
walking ick
Well he came across terribly
The recurring pan to the chicken menu 🥴
not sure who he is but he gives me the major ick
This still makes me uncomfy to this day and IDK why
He’s yucky.
MATTY WANTED TO SMOOCH😢
yes,metallica is badass
7:43 "that's pathetic" 🤣
Hahaha best one yet
He's kind of ugly idk
i hate this bloke so much
I’ll quote on the road like a twat ✋😔
I think they are meant to be 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️i think she def found the one they match other so well i ❤️❤️😂he si sweet and funny but mean Ina respectful way , girl get it together ❤️❤️
I think about this video daily
I....never wanted this to end.
i’m in love with both of them
Haha love the Narduar reference!!
the amount of self control for denying the kiss is crazy
He knows about Nardwuar
my favourite chicken shop date yet
Who is Matty Healy?
BRITISH ZIWE
idk how she was able to resist coz me? ohh no i would've jumped over the table and devoured him
0:57 wtf looks like crude oil from saudi arabia.
The way I would have died. If Matty Healy offered to kiss me.
I didn’t think I would laugh so much at this. 😂😂
He outdid you with the offer to kiss
6:29 what expression is that
her trying to smoke the cigarette took me out
I love it when they almost break character.
AHAHAHAHAHA. Why is this so cute. Matty was soooo game with the kiss 😂😂😂
Oh he's straight. 😁 That's nice.
i always think the fucking mayo ad is for cigs lol
She’s so southern so she feels the cold
I don't know how she denied that kiss 😂
PLS SHE'S SO FUNNY
am I the only one who got mild creepy vibes from Matty when he wouldn't take no for an answer?
Why does anyone fancy him
would you buy me some iron lmaoooooo
This is my fav episode, I can’t believe it doesn’t have more views. They totally match each others humor.
“I can reach” 🥵
Omg omg omgomgomg omg this is too perfect I'm dying if I was her I would have leaped into his arms if he asked to kiss me🤣😭
im in love with matt healy.
hail satan the sun who has come to give us immortal life omen
"Do people say, just please stop with the words?" That got me 😅
she has chemistry with everyone fr
笑死了绝对是最好笑的一期
The kiss on the forehead just made me die😭🤣
i want this video ingrained on the back of my eyelid so i just remember it every time i blink or close my eyes
Not a genius, clearly lol
WHO IS H????
I'm honestly so jealous...but I approve
I like to tell people I was the last good thing to come out of the 80's so I guess Matty and I will have to sort this with who has the later birthday.
You lost me at “I’m straight” tbh I’m sorry :(
"you have low iron? well that's a turn off" 😂
Bro met his match
girl fumbled the bag here. he was so into you, Amelia!!!
i'll need the uncut footage of this one please
L Rizz
i wish i had this woman’s job
i need him PLEASE one chance matty
"I have low iron" ..... "ohh..thats a turn off" LOLLLLLL
they are really giving Alyssa and James from the end of this f***ing world, the chemistry is the exact same
Is this staged or what????
I'D DO ANYTHING TO GET ANOTHER EPISODE OF THEM
damn girl that was good
When she backed him into a corner and he had to admit that he has always considered himself a genius absolutely sent me. The look on his face 😂 They had so much fun.
i could watch this forever
i can’t believe i haven’t seen the kiss part on tiktok yet
they have so much chemistry
I reckon if this wasn't on video she would have kissed 😂
This is my favorite video
Not me thinking that was molly burke
You look very pretty here Amelia.
Matthew: I'm straight   Also Matthew : lovely front row- I'd do all of you even the brooooz
I’m not nervous I have low iron
This is the dude fans wanted to kiss?
how I have I JUST discovered this series, this was the funniest shit
Please matty make a podcast please
i could never turn down a kiss from matty healy this was brave
I don't know who they are but this is hilarious, I love this kinda content, not uncomfortably sexual not cringe lovey dovey but roasting funny interview 😅
This date was by far the best REALLY HOPE THERE IS A SECOND ONE 🥹🥹
MATTY IS MY AGE?
i could not have rejected that kiss in a million years.
The way Matty says “beach ball”, reminds me of the scene in New Girl where the Russian model Nadia is just naming random American things
matty’s face when amelia started smoking a cigarette got me. i cant stop laughing 😆😆😆
I can reach 🥵🥵 I’ll be thinking of that later 💀
forehead kiss HAHAHAHAHA wow 👏👏👏
HAHAHAAHAHA
this video made me feel something for the first time in years
“Tumblr was my idea”😭😭😭
This date stressed me out
Least attractive trait, maybe being on heroin?
“Low iron? That’s a turnoff” 😂😂☠️☠️
I can see dating me is an art be a lyric in the future.
Omg u guys are Adorable together 😅the Banter
Broke character a likkle bit at the end didn’t she?
I had no idea who he was till he kissed a boy. Now I thing you two are fabulous
That guy is not bless
single-handedly funniest interview i’ve seen this year oh my god
Imagine being autistic, not getting sarcasm because of the autism and coming across this video for the first time. I really appreciate the comment section 🙃
There are times in life where you just want everything to end. There are other times when you just want to listen to Doing It Stealthy at max volume and call your boss the R-word
Oloff's music helps me to process my feelings about 9/11.
ǝɟᴉl ʎɯ pǝƃuɐɥɔ ɟɟolO ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Oloff changed my life
The first time I heard Beating the Heart by Oloff my heart stopped beating. Thank God the doctors were able to revive me.
I listen to Doing It Stealthy by Oloff whenever I need therapy. Yeah, I could pay $300 an hour for some college clown to tell me what to feel, or I could just smash great big fucking coconuts on my head and listen to my favourite song over and over again.
I can't think of a single man I would rather have kids with than Oloff. That man has a brain the size of a bowling ball.
the guitar part from 2:30 is a perfect impression of Beavis
My boy said low iron count is a turn off🤣🤣🤣
Pleaseeeee get Harry Styles on your show
He's a melt
I can’t watch this his strand of hair is making me so angry JUST GET IT OUTTA YOUR FACE
matty IM FREE PLEASE IM FREE ANY DAY OF THE WEEK ANY DAY OF THE MONTH ANY DAY OF THE YEAR IM DESPERATE
4:45 "pair of frozen hands to hold, oh she's so southern so she feels the cold..."
Matt Healy is an attention seeking sexual harasser in a medicore band.
What was he referring to? 0:06
this is the best interview i have ever seen in my entire life
I’m waiting for Julian Casablancas 😭
That actually was a great date
His hair twirl with the grin, my lord 🥰🖤
I think I’m in love with Amelia after this interview 😂😂 too much Bants
That interview is so lovely 😻😻😻
I just hit subs with this interview ..damn girl u rock !!!
This was refreshing.
The 'I can't' at 7:18 was a 2022 period piece I'm weak.  She knew it. Matty knew it.  The cameraman knew it.
i would've folded so quickly if matty healy begged to kiss me like that
i’d fold if that were me
oh this is so fun
4:00
4:01
Or some gloves 😂
Plss another date
This is gold 😂😂
she is stronger than me
"Probably my personality" LMFAO
She wanted that kiss though 😂
I ❤ his dryness and self deprecating humour to match her deadpan delivery.  Brilliant how they bounce off each other's weirdness 😆 I definitely wouldn't be able to resist the kiss tho... 😊
This is the first video of Amelia's I have ever watched and wow it was fucking great 🤣😂
Some gloves 🤣🤣
This guy looks like he could be Vincent Cassell's illegitimate son
The way he saw the game he could play in trying to get her to kiss him fr HE IS TOO POWERFUL
My fave I’ve watched it so many times already
Shout out Narduar.
Your humor only works because your a pretty female so this show is very sexist
Why do I wish they end up together?
AHHHG I NEED MORE
This is the most awkward one by far lmao
These two need to 'get down' really quick!
SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME Matt Healy  please .
i hit the like button so hard
This is comedy people!! The dry humor of them both and the timing is everything... pure gold! Wish we could see more of this!
2:13 the cook turning around and standing like an NPC somehow gave me Sn Andreas vibes😂
Matt Healy's class went over the heads of the people thinking she "slayed" denying him that kiss. That man is on another level.
"Why don't you buy me some iron supplements" "or some gloves"   I wish I was that quick and witty xD
This is my 3rd time to watch this
Beachball 😂
Amelia has him twirling his hair like a teenage girl in love 😂
we need a second date
she is so real for saying no I would've folded
This is hands down one of the best episodes!!!!
this made me have the biggest crush on him :”)))
This bitch is annoying. How is Amelia even successful ?
the sexual tension at the end lmao
I feel like he did want that kiss, cus the way he went for it and she just  😂😂 I love her bye
HOW IS THIS  FREE
I’m waiting for the day you bring Harry Styles on this
😬 Did not like the kiss thing, respect boundries dude. He put her in a weird situation. I know a lot of people are praising their chemistry but I don't see it. I think that he feels like there is chemistry it but I get a feeling that you didn't? Idk man I don't see it my dudes ^^`
This is amazing 😂😂😂
She’s stolen my most successful pickup line “Why don’t you buy me some iron supplements?” Never fails.
Is Being unfunny The BIT ?
Maybe I am - Johnny Cash
the way I would fold immediately
I dont know what to believe
Usually its the girl thats coming off cringe but this time the guest is so annoying that she seems like a genius
“I WOULD have to imagine”
Are these all awkward? 😆
Middle class white women uses black culture for her success and now you’re done with the people that actually made the show relevant to ‘CHICKEN SHOP’ date you’re pandering to all the other toffs like you 😂
Harry will be on here soon! I just know it!! I can’t wait 😌💜
haribo
WHY would you NOT KISS MATTY HEALY?????? Omg.  I would just DIE right there if I had a chance to kiss Matty Healy.  Well, I'd kiss him first, finish talking to him and THEN DIE.  Because, what IS THERE, after that?
you're a masterpiece, amelia
"did you actually go out with Aitch?" Awkward silence, guy posing
back here again
The last minute was like smth straight out of a movie
They match each others' energies perfecrly
Ive watched this 3 times and i still cant get enough
This is the greatest chicken shop date EVER
How many times did you watch this? Yes.
we need a second date
Yo si me lo besuqueo
Before seeing this I was unaware of Amelia.  This bit with Matty is great and I've watched it a few times.  Amelia is very funny making fun of Matty and I love that he can make fun of himself.
Shout out to the Narduwar reference!
best one
00:42 has me gagging ☠️
Went school with Matt taking me back
you are such an incredible interviewer!
best one yet BY FAR.
this was so funny like they’re so effortlessly funny
OMG, the chemistry between of you two is so cute.
i want to see sza next
well to be fair this isnt the type of date where you actually kiss anyone, thats getting too real. she is smart.
"Those are fake cigarettes'  "THOSE ARE FAKE CIGARETTES 😕😕😕"  I just watched Matty's heart break in real time lmao
LMAOOOO
Pleaseeee do chicken shop date with Alex Turner 😭😭😭
amelia i salute you bcus i would be too weak to resist kissing matty healy. "i can reach"???? HELLO I WOULDVE FOLDED SO FAST
HOW CAN YOU REJECT A KISS FROM THE MAN THAT WROTE ROBBERS
"Do you carry a moleskin around with you? you look like you would" ABSOLUTELY OBLITERATED
Even Matty knows about Amelia and aitch and wants the goss lmao
The moleskin 🗣🗣🗣🗣 genius 😂😂😂
This really is high art.
Need a second date !!!! Please 🌚
she gives me maeve vibes. she rejected matty? SHES A GOD
I just googled low iron and one of the symptoms is cold hands and cold feet… Amelia was right 💖
4:28 Ion couch
Who’s the bigger flirt in this video… Amelia or Matty?   🤍🤍🤍
I’m a new fan of The 1975….. about a year and a half now. I’m having tons of fun watching all their old videos and their newly posted videos. They are without a doubt my new favorite band… I’m 71 years old, which proves, you are never too old to like a new kind of music. 💖💖💖💖      I love the part in this video when Amelia tells Matty that they are fake cigarettes. 🚬🚬🚬
Matt and Amelia are completely  gold together. This was my fav episode.
"Why don't you buy me some iron supplements" "Or some gloves?"  I DIED 😅😅😅
He looks so happy and healthy! So happy for him!!!
ok matty
oh my god
THIS is good comedy
Where has this channel been? It's amazing.
you two are so funny together
this is so funny
When he leaned in for the kiss, it looked like Amelia was experiencing a demonic possession to resist, haha
8:00 IM DEADDDDD
7:25 COMMIT TO THE BIT AMELIA
6:43 LMFAOAOAOAOAO
6:36 THE FACT THEY KEEP PASSING IT BACK N FOURTH LMAO
6:32 _is that LINT?_ 😤
5:28 oH? 😼 more dates you say?
4:46 No I’m not nervous I have LOW IRON.  Amelia got defensive there LOL 😼 jk
4:01 LMFAOAAOOAO “No I wasn’t talking to you.”
3:34 “You’re an Aries.” _“Oh god…”_
3:23 🤭
2:33 IM DONEEE. AMELIA PLAYING THE GUITAR SIDEWAYS 😭😭
1:41 LMAOO
HEAR ME OUT I'm not even attracted to Matty but when the kiss part came I was SCREAMINNGG KICKING BLANKETS
I need to see Phoebe bridgers and Phoebe Waller bridge on this !! also loved this one 😄
His "oh God" when she brought up astrology sent me
why JS THIS SO FUNNYEHHABENBS I LOVE IT
why JS THIS SO FUNNYEHHABENBS I LOVE IT
This is the most awkward thing I've ever watched 🤣🤣 love it tho
The forehead kiss 😩🤌🏼
Amelia kissing his forehead and then looking at the camera was so perfect lmao
I wish he could call me pathetic
Everything from their awkward convos to the forehead kiss to the fake cigarettes was PERFECTION lol. Gave me so much anxiety and laughter altogether.
i think youre the funniest girl on youtube lol
how could she reject a kiss from matty
Charlie Puth plz
HE WAS REALLY ABOUT IT! I love this for her
i'm obsessed. and will proceed to watch this video twice a week for a long long time
This is the most fun thing I’ve seen for a very long time ❤😂 oh also that Tik-tok where a girl tries on Dua Lipa mask 😄
how is he not attractive to me at all but I'm also kinda really attracted to him
“Or some gloves” hahahahahahhaa
she's better than me. I would've given in.
I don't speak English so well. But i just want to say, that. Amelia you are so beautiful and cute. I like you. And understood it after the first video when i see you. You are wonderful girl!
3:35 "o god..." 🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣there so funny together
AMELIA THE KISS
I'm not nervous I have low iron 😭
Funny and interesting is cool 😭😭😭😭😭
People should read the Tab's article about this problematic, borderline racist show.
this video is top tier. we need a part two
He really was going in for the kiss lol
I lost it at 7:41
Saw Matty & rest of The 1975 today in DC, some other people there that me & my bestfriend made friends with told me to watch this. THIS IS AMAZING!!! I’m so happy y’all got him to do this!
Lmao him falling for her after 2 minutes is hilarious
One of my favorite chicken shop dates EVVVVER!!! 😊
DADDY 😭😍😫
i was screaming the whoole time
5:00 love this so much
Get Drake and 21 on HERE NOW
Amelia, I won't forgive you for not kissing Matty....🤣😂
PLEASEEEEEEEEEEE GO ON A CHICKEN DATE WITH LAKEITH STANFIELD PLEASE.
Sharing cigar with Matty, wow. What a dream
I don't like him all, he dosnt get it. Gives me slimey drake vibes
Please do one with 21 savage.🙏🏽
“I have low iron”
I love her hahaha
He looks better in black and white so that’s why they use it so often
That wink when he said “hot girls” 🤭🫣😳
chicken inn halal or not??
i leave for one month and come back to this hauueeeeee
We want to see more dates with White people and more Americans.
There's NO WAY that none of the guests have fallen for her, even if a bit. Even if this is generally staged, her half-acting half-real conversations are charming her guests. It's not the other way around! She is so attractive. She is pretty but it's her personality, her demeanour, her CHARM that truly make her beautiful.
she sounds exactly like lucy watson from MIC
THE CIG BIT HAD ME SCREAMING
Is she his girlfriend??? I'm confused o.O
“you’re an aries” *defeated look*
god’s strongest soldier bc i’ve got butterflies from just watching the vid
Please get W2S Harry on here that would be so funny !!!
Big ears contest?
Didn't this jerk mock someone for having an Irish name...
There has to be a full video to this.
You should've lit the wrong end of the cigarette
“Please just stop with the words” 😂
Why does he speak like this when his parents are Geordies?
She looks like discount Amber Heard.
im in love with matty healy
He looks like Violet Chachki
this is genuinely i think the funnniest one oh my god i wish they were dating in real life
second date please!!!!!
didnt think i could love matty more than i already did but here we are
why he thinks his personality least attractive I don’t think 😳
next album is about to be about amelia
its true matty did invent tumblr i was there
Matty 😭❤
Ps: u need sub to understand em
“so you’re an aries” “ugh” he’s just like me
they match their energies so well. they’d be so cute together tbh
“i can reach” LORDDDDDDD
I’d fall in love
I'm in love with Healy's grey lock
i won’t him so bad
I can't! This is so funny. 🤣
I cannot even believe how awkwardly hilarious this is! This is completely tied with the Jack Harlow date as my absolute favorite Chicken Shop Date!
I love this man
Give the video editior a raise pleaseeee!
i’ve watched this video three times in the past hour
oh god
i think this is creepy is it only me ?
She almost just got the worlds best boyfriend but she wouldn’t even kiss him 😮
that was so cute btw <3
We need another episode👀👀
The power she has here is unparalleled.
man thats some harsh lighting
this interview is so unhinging and i love it
THIS IS HILARIOUS
jesus he really is this generations morissey, they act exactly the same
He thinks he is good looking
Who's Lizz Trust?
I loved every bit of this.
This is hilarious hahah
I thought she only had lucozades??
I would very much like to watch her interview Kitt Harrington.
Wow. I can’t decide if this is the best episode or if Burna boy is the best episode. this was fantastic. Amelia thought about giving him a kiss. She really thought about it but I’m glad she didn’t do it. Because then everybody’s going to expect a kiss.
I honestly LOVE this
These two match each other so well lmao
get alex turner
This was far more intense than any pornn
I ship it
😆😆😆😆
Wowowoww
i will never get over this video
love them!!!!! <3333
サイコー
Amelia! You smashed this one out of the arena... The awkward vibe and banter was top class. Matty is absolutely amazing and good on ya for sticking to your guns and not giving him a kiss.
this was wild from beginning to end
This is the first date I've watched. I can't imagine anyone elses topping it.
i'm in love with this man
Love Amelia but sorry I can’t bear Matty Healy, I know this show is all about fake arrogance but he’s so arrogant any time I see him and he’s so up his own arse
excuse my language but this was fucking really good!!!!!
Matty never felt this straight
this is like the 5th time i’ve watched it and it never gets old it’s so good damn it
This is my favorite one so far lmaoo up there with Jack Harlow
that was great
All I’m get out of this is a mad craving for chips and fat fried chicken. Fookin hell.
i loved this😭
That was awesome. I love how disappointed you made him. What a knob.
I am hoping there is a 2nd date lol to me this is the best one lol❤️ chemistry is amazing lol
Omg if I had the chance to kiss matty I would even if I did have cigarette n chicken breath 😂
Please do one with Tyler the creator lolol
I LOVE THIS EPISODE SO FREAKING MUCH !!!!! WE NEED TO SEE THE UNCUT VERSION PLSS !!
this is the best one by far, the connection is insane
"You have low iron? That's a turn off"
THE STRENGTH SHE POSSESSES
this is so wholesome
This the most British interaction I've ever witnessed.
Amelia looks gorgeous.
This was so fun
holy ears
love the sarcasm on this!! !hahahaahah
get alex turner pls
Imagine denying a kiss from Matty healy 😩😩🥲 I’d fold
the best date hands down hahahaha
"You have low iron? That's a turnoff" 😂
I Don t find this funny at all, but, ei, people also voted for Trump, so...;)
Alex Turner next please
This was so fun to watch! Legit! 💖🔥
Caleb needs to come on
Must of been weird for Amelia interviewing an actual musician.
This dude sucks, his music sucks😞
This dude sucks, his music sucks😞
unfortunately I do ship this now
get mae martin on
Crying
This interview is amazing!
I just love how every person she dates just ends the date a little bit in puppy love with her while she's like... erm... no
"Why?" Genuinely wonders why lol
Now it’s Alex Turner’s turn
I recently read an article where it says that Matt Healy says that Metallica: is the worst Band of all time... What a good joke..🤣🤣🤣🤣 . in my opinion Matt Healy is a nobody , however Metallica are the Gods of Metal.  And history is a witness.
I hate this guy.
After all that chemistry he left! Bit much to have a kiss recorded out there in public. Hope it’s not over. Chicken shop advertised noted 😂
this interview needs to be studied
My psychiatrist prescribed me to watch this daily
She definitely wanted to kiss him 😂
I love this interviewer dynamic, format, and energy. I love this. I absolutely love thanks chicken
could have kissed Matty...and ya shit the bed
HAHAHA OMG I LOVE THIS GIRL
Ok. This was hot. Thank u
Every time this video appears on my suggestions I need to watch it 🤣
Favorite lyric “it’s not living if it’s not with you”
His irritation when she mentioned star signs.. one for the bois..
yike his reactions to the no kiss lmao
We need the uncut version of this video😂
This might be my favorite date, it's neck and neck with Jack's. I'm not sure I'd have the strength to turn down the kiss😂😂😂
Amelia, PLEASE go on a second date with Matty plssssss
You really see in her face that she genuinely thought about kissing him for a second. They actually got a weird but at the same time beautiful chemistry together 🥺
The response to the Aires question is pretty much all mens internal response to women into astrology.
That was pretty coercive and problematic at the end
Strawberry Volvic slaps
the awkward chemistry that made me feel like i’m thirdwheeling
This is the closest match to her wit that I've ever seen! She friend zoned him full stop though with that forehead kiss.  I definitely would not have been able to refuse him with that chemistry.
Real men felt his “oh god” after the “you’re an aries”
also breaking news: matty healy invented doc martens
her saying she has low iron and matty just replying with "that's a turn off" had me laughing for twenty minutes I swear
This is actually my favorite YouTube video ever
They probably wouldn't work well in real life, but damn, they would be amazing as characters from a romance novel 😹
As impossible as it sounds, I hate the 1975 even more after watching this
the cigarette bit was prob my fav moment on this whole show
If Matty called me pathetic I would genuinely die
this is really cool
He's not attractive
OMG the kiss on the forehead took me oooout 😂
HAHAHAHAHHAHA
His dangling hair got on my nerves
"your slut era" HELLO
This was so awkward and funny as hell!
Aitch gets brought up in every episode
This feels like an episode of the office
the level of self-restraint I would have to exercise if I was her
“Give it up” 😂😂
These are my last 2 braincells
alex turner please
They filmed this in my ends. North West London, Cricklewood.
Is it just me or was Amelia genuinely uncomfortable with the kiss and masking it with polite refusal
*forehead kiss*  "That's pathetic"  I SCREAMED
This was the best interview ever
he started regretting it from first minute
“or some gloves”🤣
Asking about her ex on the first date , red flag 😭
Damn. Seemed to not want to take no for an answer... What was the allegation status again?
the internet wouldve imploded if she kissed him
This is comedy gold. They work well together
The lip lick after ‘let’s kiss for real right now’.. she is a strong willed women
GOD I WISH SHE WOULD OF KISSED MATTY
WHO IS H??
i need to stop watching this. This is maddening me because it’s addictive🤣🤣🤣
nardwuar reference 🥲💕
Omfg THE ALMOST KISS
do night lovell
Slut era 😂
pin if amelia is the funniest
YEAH MATTY YOURE AN ARIES WHAT ABOUT IT
please get adele on a date that would be hilar!
think alex turner or liam gallagher on here would be funny af
the way i screamed when he leaned in for the kissssss
❤❤❤❤
Funny moments but a bit boring...😉
lol that was really funny
Amelia is a stronger human than me
Id like to see u interview nardwuar
Now we need him on Hot Ones
One of the best ones 😅 Love iiiit
this is amazing
"for you are not beside but within me" is the best The 1975 lyric and shame on Matty for not picking it.
is it just me or was there a spark there 👀
I love how these shops are always halal ahaha
Amelia is too much:')
Stormzy?
he like  his men like soy milk, sweet and doesn't offend anybody....
I watch this video one time EVER DAY because it makes me smile AND laugh! ☺😆😆😆❤
“why don’t you buy me some iron supplements”  “or some gloves”   🤣🤣🤣🤣
he's gross.
Narduar.
I was born in the 80s, I was born in 1989 and I'm still young, and relevant. - Matty Healy, 2022
this is everything hahaha so much chemistry
forehead kiss yay
he dont know about math rock
I lost it at 1:45 seeing Matty's face when she says "I wouldn't have asked you if I wasn't in love with you". From that moment, the chemistry sky rocketed. I rarely laugh that much on youtube
this was high art
Funniest interview ever
Johnny Cash reference with the “Maybe I am” he’s turnt
BUY HER THE GLOVES MATTY
Nice touch with the switch to black and white when she puts the lighter on.  But i agree with her "Don't smoke"
I TRULY SHIP THIS TWO
Hands down the best episode
😊❤
😃
omg when they share the cigarette together they are technically kissing skfjsjdsjk
HONESTY the best one you’ve done
A part of my soul actually needs them to date
part 2 pls 3x
Please do Alex Turner
Amelia please get Alex Turner here 🙏🏽
the humour entire of this video smoothly splattered all over the place
are you swedish
I need part 2
please get together.
Omg that piece of hair is so triggering 😭😭😭😭
as someone who has met matty hewaly i 100% believe that ending was real
her asking “what’s your favorite lyric, that you’ve written?” and him not answering “don’t fall in love with the moment and think you’re in love with the girl” is CRIMINAL.
Wonder if she'd do one with Alex turner
This is the perfect atmosphere for him 😂😂😂
we should bottle this
Matty healy is straight?
now if she got Matt Smith on this show
the way amelia rejected the kiss is something i couldn’t do
🎵You think we're doing it again. Keep dreaming 🎵
'or some gloves'...  hilarious
Why am I gettin hungreh lad
This is my 4th time watching and I’m still smiling from till the end of the vid
She refused to kiss Matty Healy when he offered WHAT KIND OF SUPERPOWER DOES SHE THINK SHE HAS
If I could just not be attracted to someone completely unachievable, that would be great…
SHE SHOULD HAVE KISSED HIM
It’s the  “You’re an Aries”  🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ For me lolololol
Can you go on a date with Lewis Capaldi please? ❤️
this is giving the same energy and chemistry as that one interview with rob pat and hayley williams
Matty is absolutely gorgeous! ❤
“I was born in 1989. I’m still young and relevant.” 😂 honesty is the best policy Matty.
4:25 Its probably good advice 😔😔
The way I would have made out with this man I love him
I have no idea who either of these people are but this was so much fun to watch.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 thats perfect this is a perfect episode
I need a chicken shop date with harry styles
LMAO THEY WAY AMELIA SAID SURE WHEN MATTY SAID HE WAS STILL RELEVANT
Or some gloves 🤣💀💀💀
this video had me kicking my feet and giggling
When he went "oh God"😂😂😂😂
What's she doing on a date with a white guy? Stop the presses
“I’m an innovator” then proceeds to eat a nugget with a smize. The best 🤣🤣🤣
when he chuckled because she said "don't do it" about the podcast 🤣
How can he stand that fucking hair over his eye, it's driving me mad even watching this
Why are they actually so perfect 😭😂 I loved this!
this is def a top tier episode 😂😂😂
Matty ripped into Amelia the whole video💀
One of my favourites yet! Good vibes from both of them
I've Already watched this for about 10 times. 🤧
Matt Healy looking like he should quit smoking
SECOND DATE PLS
This needs to win an award or something omg this was incredible AHH
He got REAL defensive after that very innocent 1975 joke.
he really is a brilliant comedian 😂
he’s right this is high art
It's been a week since this aired. Anyone has been able to get over the kiss that never was? because I SURE HAD NOT. I'm Katniss Everdeen over here...
Amelia is hilarious I’m dying
Tumblr and Dr. Martens are his creation for sure
He is a FLIRT
She should’ve kissed him man!!!
I love matty he’s a chaotic level has always been at the top tier 😭 he did in fact  invent neon tumblr doc martens and cigarettes
this is so funny
Lmao best interview yet
Matty wetting his lips like... 🤨😙😎
Thanks Matt x
Spam ☺️
Who invented this term "British humour"?? Every video of UK I see or yours especially, British people be commenting this shit. Rest of the world doesn't use such terms.  I know brits want Superiority in everything but now in humour as well?? 🙄  Btw if this is British humour, it sucks. :/
MATTY & AMELIA could be the perfect casts on another The end of the F***ing world series.   And also we need part 2 🙈🥺🥺🥺🥺
that liz truss quip did not age well
Getting ready for some obscure chicken shop reference lyric
mattyyyy 😂
i didnt think i could love the idea of her with matty more than with jack harlow but wooooow these two are so funny and cute 🤣🤣
This man has the greatest energy😭😭
"Dating me is an art" i dieddd
Get Ryan gosling
Matt??? What kind of name is that!?!?!
She dropped the ball tbh
*chef's kiss* on the Nardwuar reference
This date turns me on lol
first of all.... having the same name as me.... and THEN LIVING MY DREAM  YOUUUUUU LITTLE amazing person
I'm blushing
this man tryna hit for real
This is hilarious 😂😂
Amelia contemplating if she should risk it all and kiss him 😂😂😂 I love this episode
“I have low IRON”
Personality? 🤣🤣 No idea who this pillock is but he’s boring as fook
He called her bluff on everything which is incredible
We know you secretly kissed...
BROSKI NATION
"I was born in 1989, and I'm still young, and I'm still relevant." OMG
I immediately want to see a second date. Why am I rewatching this so many times? It's so awkward but I can't stop???
I can’t stop watching this video 😭
Ok but wait he was really gonna go for it 😱😳
I enjoyed every bit of this. She's hilarious
i think that’s the most uncomfortable shit i’ve ever watched
his capricorn stellium was so loud here lmao
Matty is so me when people bring up star signs. 💀💀💀
we need a second date
manifesting Alex Turner as a guest 😅
very funny
shes the girl from the ring meme right? hahahaha and also from the song that became famous on tiktok.
Amelia:Buy me some iron supplements Matty:Or gloves 😂😂😂
Is it just me, or does he literally have a grey  hair on his suit?
1:37 - Matty was doing so well and she make him break character and laugh.    Good comedy.
Only just found out his mums that fool from loose women and he’s a smack head….
Not the hair twirling 😭
Best yet.
Matty baiting himself out for miming is hilarity
HE IS SUCH ARROGANT TOFF. I THINK HE WAS SHOWING HIS PREDATORY SIDE. HE HATED THAT SHE WOULDN'T KISS HIM. HILARIOUS. HORRIBLE MAN
We need a second date, this was just 👌🏻
I'm in love with this silly little rat man
Plz take Darkest on a date next
Yassssssssssss 🎉🎉
WE NEED A SECOND DATE OK
Its hella disappointing that she didn't say "thank you Kanye very cool" after he called himself a genius
When she asks matty if he carry’s a moleskin around with him I fucking died 🤣🤣
The only way this could be topped is if she dates Nathan Fielder. An unstoppable deadpan force meets an unmovable deadpan force.
I'm new here. So the shtick of this is it's suppose to be an awkward date, or she tries to half flirt half be a bitch? I'm confused. Is that the point, that I be confused?
DATE THE BARSTOOL HOMIE ..???! THEEEEEE (( Mr. CALEB PRESLEY ))
This was pure fun!
he's like a fucked up version of tyler joseph
Whoever disliked this lives in the matrix.
ew he’s a douche lmfaooo 😂
Why is he giving off Eren Jaeger vibes
"You're an Aries"
You copy my name
Hands down my favourite date
This is better than I expected. So funny
Omg amelia you actually look so pretty with that hair
SO U WERE BORN IN 1975😭😭😭
@02:17 Perfect summary of the interview
“Or gloves” fkn brilliant
i need the bloopers of this
So never saw these before, I guess awkward is the style. But him actuLly trying to do things with her was more awkward?? Good for her for staying on target
Honestly you're an icon Amelia!!!! Much love from Serbia xoxo🇷🇸❤💕
This is one of the best dates to date 🥹🥹
holy shit. yes.
The moleskin question had me crying
This was so good the kiss bit was hilarious
Who is this Dude?  He is funny 😂😂😂😂
this is the best one i've seen so far. I think...? Any other suggestions from anyone?
lmaooo
You guys are hilarious!!!!   From Utah - thank you!!  It's over and I'm still laughing!!!   WTH!!!
when she started smoking that cigarette… this is so the 1975
Best one to date 😂😂 So awkward
Get a room you two !! 🙄
I know Matty hated every second of this lolllll
I can't stop watching this. Best date yet, cry laughing the whole time.
This is the first full episode I've seen of this show, and it feels like a fever dream
My fav one so far!!!
I’ve never seen one of these dates. So funny 😂
when she brought up his zodiac sign LMAOO
THEM: How many times have you rewatched this date? ME: yes
this is so funny hahahhahahahahahaha the way she burns matty but in a funny way and never really takes it seriously haha
Rip H
Omg I want him
The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy. Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.   (Psalm 147:11-12) - We are all sinners. Believe in Jesus Christ, Repent and be saved.
I don’t even know who Matt Healy is, but I’ve watched this on repeat every day since it’s been out so far.  Amazing.   Some people discover Amelia through artists, I discover artists through Amelia.
😂😂😂
I’m 31 I’m too old for this kind of shit. Why do i still swoon over lead singers of my fave bands like I’m 14. It’s tiring 🥲
Best thing ive seen for weeks. Why are they so bloody short though???
pls god have mercy on my soul
Please give us Black Sherif🙏🏽
You should have kissed him. It's Matty Freaking Healy. lol   You missed out I'd bet.
twat healy*
Being obsessed with him and The 1975 in high school and college this is just Matty being Matty lol
One of her worthy opponents after finneas
He had to confirm his sexuality after all this time 😂😂
She is gorgeous tbf
Best episode ever, the forehead kiss had me rolling. We need a second date!
One of the best episodes yet 😂
OMG THAT ALMOST TOPPED JACK HARLOW LMAOOOOO
This is humor art
this is... unbelievable. i can't believe this... i... there is so much to say
Brilliant! lol
Such a fun interview guys thank you!
“You’re an aries” “God….” I’m dying
Who’s this muppet
this is so insane and insanely good i’m floored
4:22 Marco White Pierre headass
Get married pls🎉😍🥰
"..well you know, you've gotta enjoy your life" is such an underrated line LMAOOO
DID THAT JUST HAPPEN
Dios mio i have somehow landed in an alternate universe where people actually like this absolute prick
this is by far the best one what the fuck
100% this is the best chicken shop date so far. Matty going back and forth with her was spicy. Almost like actual flirting 🤔
Matty is adorable but he looks like shit... I love the guy but you can see that he's been through some hard times
Does Amelia know who Nardwuar is? That's a deep reference
this was like nails on a chalkboard he's so old man
Wow it feels so awkward watching you flirt with MY husband
This is the funniest episode ever
How did she refuse that kiss?? How???!!!! 😪
whats her sign? ive noticed she gets along w Aries. like Summer walker. i wanna b Amelia's friend lol
She’s the most powerful woman on this EARTH
IM DYING AHH !! how did they not kiss!!!
WHAT I WOULDVE DONE TO HAVE HIM LEAN OVER LIKE THAT AMELIAAAAA
Why do men-Aquariuses make that face when you ask them their zodiac sign?
She started taking white guys to the chicken shop after getting called out that's great
WHY IS SHE SO GOOD AT THIS AND I LOVE THAT SHE IS SO GOOD THEY LIKE IT
Him whining about not getting a kiss is so hot
this is so awkward to watch but ahhhhh I can't look awayy
please get Yung Gravy!
she really just lived out my dream huh hahahaha ly <3
I'm gag!!!!
Album’s 🔥
within the first 2 minutes this guy confirmed all my worst presumptions about him
"I'm straight" -- Matty Healy
this is iconic
Why is nobody cracking up at the cigarette part?
Do you carry a mole skin around you look like you would absolutely ruined me 😂😂
When Brittany Broski sees this she’s going to die
i wish i could heart this video instead of like
One day, we'll be able to say we witnessed their first date.
Next we need him on the cooking show
“maybe you can buy me some .. iron supplements😉” “or some gloves🫤” this is acc well funny
“I wouldn’t call myself a genius” “But you just did” “Well no I described my v- so yeah I’ve always been a genius”
“This is your slut era” 💀
being compared to nardwuar is incredible
This is even better than the date with Jack Harlow, which was my favourite until now! I wish it lasted for at least 30 mins :D You two together are just hilarious
😄
😂😂 came here for Matty but go Amelia
The underlying chemistry in their subtle stares and little smiles.. Damn.
She is amazing, I don’t care if u don’t get it
I dig this dude!
8 unhinged minutes
Can you imagine an episode with Alex Turner?!
nice to see you in another halal chicken and chips shop
The things I’d do for niko to be on this show
SOULMATES!!!
THIS WAS FUCKING SO GOOD
why do i remember watching this a few months ago? what the deja vu
What a match 😌
im not saying there's explosive chemistry butttttt
The ending was so cringe 😭
I’ve never clicked on an interview so fast
Matty looked so troubled when he was talking about his Moleskine
He has just felt like a child with that kiss on the head
i genuinely can’t tell if matt is arrogant or putting on an act
Isn’t he married?
matty is so smooth lmao
But can we talk about the fact the she told Matty no to a kiss 3/4 times ?? And he still felt the need to approach her??  Amelia is a queen and I respected the hell out of that.
Okayyyyy I’m obsessed with them! This is one of my favorite dates so far 😍
The chemistry! Oof! I don't know if I wanna smoke or invent a sandwich rn.
I’m not nervous I have low iron was one for the girlies I felt that right there
I don’t even know Matt or 1975..but let me tell you..I’ve watched this four times❤
His mum is Denise welsch
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is the best thing I’ve seen on the internet in awhile what is this?  Chicken Shop Date?? Hell yeah
Super like
Why does he talk normally but sing like he's having a stroke?
I love his personality
"Why are you going up?" "I want you to go down"😭😭😭
this was brilliant
creepy energy
pls do louis tomlinson 🤞
I want more of this
Matty listing all of the things he invented reminds me of Nadia, this Russian model on a date with Schmidt in New Girl, listing random stuff 😂
The kiss on the forehead killed me hahahah
Amelia what’s it like to have lived my dream?
oh my goodness this fella flipped the game but that forehead kiss should be illegal😂😂😂😂
homie in da mask at 02:15 kinda served
idk who he is but he gives me creepy vibes tbh ….. amelia is clearly in a character why was he trying to actually be flirty i got so much second hand embarrassment from this man
Most romantic thing said in this whole video Amelia: why don't you buy me some iron? Matty: or some gloves?
Amelia: You're an Aries Matty: Oh GOD
Matty: This is like high ar(t) Amelia: well, dating me is an art
Amelia: What's like your least attractive trait that you have? Matty: Prob my personality Amelia: mmmm, yeah.. Matty: yeah...
This is definitely the best one yet😂😂😂
AMEILIA IS TRULY GIVING US WHAT WE WANT
This date looks/sounds like a date between james and alyssa from 'the end of the fucking world' I mean like her accent, his suit It just does.🙂
He’s a weirdo him
they actually started flirting for real ahhhh
They would actually be so cute together !! Couldn't stop laughing throughout the video 😭😭😂😂😂😂😂
The level of self control to say no to that kiss oml
it's so hard to tell what's real and what's not! Did she genuinely feel uncomfortable about that kiss?
By far the funniest chicken shop date 😂. I have no idea who this guy is but I can’t stop watching! This is hilarious 😂😂😂😂
IM DYING HES SO FUNNY AND FOR WHAT 😭
Release the cuts!
This was great😂
Anna Jobling
second date. second date. second date. second date. second date. second date. second date. second date. for the fans please.
you can see the exact moment matty "felt a flirt" haha
She meet her match 😂
she humbled him with the forehead kiss omg
That moleskine burn
Comedy gold!
Oh wait wow he's actually a total narcissist LMFAOOO i can't imagine him being capable of a genuine selfless conversation tbh but this vid was top tier
OMG MATTY HEALY
Amelia i need one w alex fucking turner istg please im begging
Get some gloves. Had to chuckle when he said that.
He looks 45
He can’t be straight noooo😢
Bruh the “I can reach” made me hot and bothered 🥵🥵🥵
Low bringing batty boys on bring on proper artists like Wiley, Skepta, JME or Central Cee
“no i’m not nervous i have low iron” LMAO only amelia
WE NEED LOUIS TOMLINSON ON HERE
The satire version, of an unstoppable force v an unmovable object
She's playing hard to get for the next date, I love her 😂😂
My favourite of all times such vibes
Don't know him but it was very funny
best episode yet holy
this is probably the best video of this fucked up year for me!
HE BROKE HER
WAHHHHH KILIG MUCH
Get Lewis Capaldi or Joe Quinn pleeeeease
I need them to go out bc they match each other’s energy so well
I want him so bad. AgainZ
i cannot believe he tried to kiss her and she denied. shes much better than me because i would have leapt at him
Even after watching for so long I cant decide if this show is genius or just plain crazy. I love it but I don't understand it and I think that's the best part.
She's better than me I would have kissed him lmao
AHHH !! DIDN'T EVER EXPECT THIS EPISODE TO HAPPEN.
her little moment of panic after he walks away
🧤📔 🙌 I’m an innovator. I can’t. Amazing.
Effortless and brilliant! Toe to toe- loved it. Watching again 😂
Wait they actually suit eachother sooooo well
I feel as though Amelia has finally met her match in Matty
**I have low iron**  **well that’s a turn off**  😂😂😂
This had me dying
Wow that got a whole other kind of awkward toward the end there.
Y DO I SHIP SO HARD PLZ
I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I cannot believe this has happened. I love it.
I loved This
She should have him a big ol' pash lol
i cant breath 🤣
he flinched when she said no
Matt won the date
I love when the guest is British as well because they have the right sense of humour to have a good back and forth with Amelia. Americans just get flustered because they can’t tell what is sarcasm and what is real hahaha.
Does she script these or are these legit this funny and off the cuff?
DJ KHALED WAS BORN IN 1975!?!
Hilarious. Thank 🙏 you
When Amelia said she has low iron so her hands are cold I cackled because girl same
God Matty is sexy
whyd he look so cool when he grabbed the cig
“I have low iron”.    “ we’ll that’s a turnoff” 😂😂
oh hell naw
This concept was dead until this. He tries to hard and no. Good for her.
This is definitely my favorite chicken shop date by far.
why do i feel like matty was trying very hard to flirt with her
Is it weird that this video made me horn ee?
“youre an aries” “oh god🙄”
cannot fucking stand this man
Besides the fact that I love Matthew, this has to be one of the best episodes 😂😂
i've never seen chicken shop data before this but surely this one tops them
wait this isn't amber heard?
**BEGGING FOR OUTTAKES**
These chicken shop dates really do give you an insight into peoples sense of humour and thus their personalities. What I’ve inferred from this is; there’s a hell of a lot of cool people about! 😂
😛😛😛😛😛
THE WAY I CLICKED SO FAST
Matty is so fine 😩
"So you're an aries." - deep sigh haha
He's not what I expected
"and I'm still young and relevant 😤"
jack harlow is gonna be mad jealous after seeing this one
Hi Amelia
Nice 🦫🦔
This is a message to you dont smoke....heroin
OOO BABES THOUGHT ABT IT
Matty is probably the closest to making her break 😂😂
the tenssionnn
We need bloopers of this one!!!
goinh insane at the kiss refusal thats y/n energy
"I have low iron" "that's a turn-off" 🤣
Funniest episode so far! That Aries & cigarette part omg 😂😂
i would never turn down a kiss from matty wtf
This is my favourite dates you have done!!
04:22 ✨EXACTLY✨
i'm watching this on loop for the rest of my life
Honestly, this was hilarious.
This was beautiful, the kiss at the end destroyed me
I would never wash my forehead again!
This has just become my favorite video on the internet
HER FLIRTING IS SO RELATABLE. Holding hands and saying "I HAVE LOW IRON" hahahahah
Amelia denying the kiss, then looking around awkwardly gives the same energy as Jack Harlow saying "love ya" and Emma Chamberlain laughing as he walked away.
“I’m not nervous I have low iron” 💀
*I can reach*....Hello SEXUAL TENSION!!! btwThat cigarette exchange was lowkey so damn hot and foreplay-ish. Makes me hella happy to see how people are shipping this so hard.
Amelia is the best host !! Love every single episode 🤩🤣
get josh kiszka on this
no means no matty
Please get Tom Odell on one of these
3:36 The disappointment. lol
this is exactly what i signed up for.
Lmfbao 😂 Love her 😂
This is like a fanfic
this is hands down my fave one she’s ever done it’s so funny lmao
Hey Aitch 👋 I know you’re watching you lil stalker you!
"I CANT REACH" "I CAN REACH"  THE WHOLE WORLD STOPPED
LOW IRON A TURN OFF??? LKSDKHGKDHJSAJ
Stop them holding hands is cute😭
The way he says exactly is sending me 💀💀💀
oh i love this so much
Im gona banjo hur llf ❤
ngabrut dicium jidatnya 😭🤏
Amber Heard and Drake bell
Wish there was an extended version of this episode
I'd go on a second date with both of them. At the same time.
That was fun to watch, and the way you both do dry humour is marvelous. Loved it ! (and this editing ??)
“Or some gloves” 😂
nardwuar heck yeah!
Compared to Hot Ones..... I don't know if I like this better.
The last part felt a little too real, hope it was all jokes and agreements on both sides. I hope you’re ok Amelia, overall I enjoyed the video.
Grab him he is better than aitch!!!
Emilia fumbled the bag jkfhghglobdgh
😂
id do an earnest kiss with you matty
Amelia is done  with black kings Since she s famous she can afford white preppy boys😂
hearing a grown man say "slut era" outside of twitter conversation threw me out of a loop 🤣
relevant?
Funny how it's against the law to smoke indoors
Why is nobody talking about Matty's hair twirl 2:52
"So, you were born in 1975" 😂
Nurdwar reference!
What an insufferable man.
This is a cigarette date shop 😂
I'd of kissed him, tf😹😹
If he asked me to kiss him I couldn't be capable of denying it
“I’m an elevator”…. So edgy🥵
she was out flirted 😂
Hands down the best chicken shop date. I absolutely loved it
She should’ve lit the wrong end of the cigarette
Him practically begging for a kiss 🫠 “I can reach” had me floored LIKE 🥵
SHE GOT SO FLUSTERED AND NERVOUS WHEN HE OFFERED TO KISS HER LMMFAOOO SHE DEBATED IT YEP
im fuming they cut her response to whether she actually went out with Aitch lol
He's the male replica of Amelia. I love it!
"or some gloves" is his best lyric 🤣
You’re FUCKING hilarious
Matty knowing about a slut era 🤣 he’s chronically online and i love it so much
Matty knowing about a slut era 🤣 he’s chronically online and i love it so much
matt’s disdain when amelia spoke about star signs took me OUT 😂
matty fr fell in love
I see matt healy i watch
THE KISS
Please for the love of god take paddy pimblet on a date
INVITE PADDYYYYY
God he is so gross. I love him
Amelia and Average Rob will be a perfect date!
This man is beautiful
Kilig
Their energy matches so well 😂😂 the roasting flirting is on point
Matt Healy always have this melting looking appearance but it’s so cute. Cant explain it
The fake cigarettes were like a slap in the face for Matty
I'm actually crying laughing
Forehead kiss was a power move, big ups to Amelia putting him back in his place.
Nardwuar reference 🙌🏼🎉
Funny thing is. This guy constantly compares his band to Arctic Monkeys. Yet he’d do anything to be relevant. I can bet my life savings on you’ve never see Alex Turner doing this. He doesn’t need. or want to be relevant.
QUALITY
Ben cohen if you ever see this, matty healy reminds me of you (not in a good way or bad way,,, like in a neutral way)
Wow this was one my favourites!!
3:36 THAT LOOK ON MATTY'S FACE 😭😭😭😭😭 HE HATES ZODIACS AND STUFF SM
The imagine being a genius at school is hilarious 😂 😃 😄.
ship
🔥🥰🔥🥰
now i need one with alex turner
Thought it was the dude from Drake and Josh at first glance lol
LMFAO when he asked amelia about her and aitch 😂 I CANNNT
or gloves. I associate with the Aries
0:46 Chicken Shop Date w DJ Khaled
eu n teria essa força pra negar meus parabéns guerreira
Matty's response when asked about being an Aeries - that is me
Loved this! 😂 My favourite lyric would have to be "Get someone you love? Get someone you need? Fuck that, get money!" 🙃
he kinda looks like a masc violet chachki
"I have low iron" LOL
this made me blush so hard
la manera en la que tuve que parar el video cuando la quiso besar aakddjk q enano de mierrd lo amo
Or some gloves?😂🤣🤣🤣💔
highest art
His face when she asked if he's an Aries 😂😂😂
this was so funnyyyyy
“Listen, you’re gorgeous but I’m going on tour for a very long time”. THAT is a taste of real life 😂. This show was just made for someone like him - a guy you should never date in real life but as a shameless, piquing flirt,  he’s a great time. And Amelia’s just the girl to call him out on everything - the suit, the moleskin, the genius - all of it.
My new fav episode 😂
nice
the refusal of the kiss???? with Matty looking at her like that???? god’s strongest soldier right here
Him trying to pressure her into a kiss was....uncomfortable. Do better, Matty. You don't get a pass because you're in a band.
How do you prepare a guest for an interview like this? 😅
😂😂😂🤣
IF MATTY TELLS YOU TO KISS HIM, YOU KISS HIM DAMN IT! jk jk! Im cryying with laughter at how awkward that part was 😂😂😂
Genuinely the creepiest episode ever.
Lololol
she's so strong I would've folded
Cómo pudo resistirse a ese besooo yo me lo como!! 😂
ANOTHER VIDEO
This is very weird interview. You look like a couple that had a fight, but then decided to do the interview anyway
“You’re an Aries” “oh god”
how does she not blush
Favourite bit 😂 3:34
Hard work watching this🥲
Try and add subtitles
iconic
This is Violet Chachki
I need a 2nd date
Loved this
Imagining how shy I'd be if Matty wanted a kiss
Am I actually the only person who got really grossed out by Matty here? Like I used to think he was so fit but the fact that he wasn't taking the No from Amelia for that kiss and LITERALLY leaned in to do it anyway while she was saying no?? Idk if that's meant to be a joke but all I'm seeing is a lack of respect for boundaries/consent and I hope people keep a close eye on him...
They match each others energy so well this interview was so funny
This was good until the end - shameful
she considered. he's a hero
I have no idea who this guy is, but he seems chill af.
but like was he serious about liking her bc i thought he had a gf
This man looks exactly like Violet Chachki out of drag
when he said "I can reach" I felt a wall growing in the middle of them
Hilarious 😂
I think he actually outweirded Amelia! This is love, right?
Why do I find him attractive yet I think he probably would be quite pretentious?
Matty's dedication to the bit tryna play Amelia at her own game... is so fun to watch!!!
Please invite Mark Tuan from Korean  pop band GOT7  0
Eddie van Halen plays up his guitar
I wonder how Brittany Broski is doing right about now?
“Straight” sure..
hes like a leftist morissey
2:38 why you going up here? He hates it hahahaha he'd be like, we don't play it like that
They should do central cee
The way I was FREAKING OUT when he tried to kiss her
your face lights up when u are on this show with white people as opposed to when u are with blacks. clap fo yoself.
The kiss was so akward u could tell she didn’t want to do even for the bit
Someone plz send me that lost fry in the grease
I keep coming back
Why does he look like a very young kitten that just woke up from a nap
this interview has me by the balls honestly
"So... you were born in 1975."
this is becoming absolutely unhinged and I love it!!
Normal people should be locked away in prison. These evil trash aren't fit to walk the streets without restraints.
he’s so sexy still
This is the best CSD episode there has ever been! GOLD!
Thank you
YO WHAT JUST HAPPENED 😅
bruh amelia roasting matt for 8 minutes straight
enjoyed this so much u both are so cutely humorous
This was everything..
My heart was RACING at the end there 😂
Half aggressive discomfort, half absolute arousal.
A never ending flirt to the end
she missed her chance to lit the wrong end of her cigarette
so chaotic hahaha
i need alex turner on here
najjaca do sada
1M soon let’s goo
listen guys… the show has peaked here 😭
0:15 "it's like Nardwuar" best compliment you could give an interviewer
Hear me out… I know nothing about the 1975 or Matty Healy… but this is by far the greatest, most chaotic episode of chicken shop date I’ve ever watched and I live for it
Matt Healy finally bought the battle pass
I immediate cut after he asked about aitch
his disdain when she says he's an Aries hahaha
Kicking my feet in the air
cant believe id live the day that id hear Matthew healy say "slut era"
She should have lit the wrong side of her cigarette
I'm wheezing😂we need a part 2 please
Wheres digga d
this is the funniest one yet
Rattling off all the things he invented 😂😂 this is pure gold content.
About as funny as piles this women
Am I the only one that instantly thought of the lyric "you're cold and I burn, I guess I'll never learn" when they held hands lol
How’s she anemic eating all that chicken?
Plsss now i need more of them
The kiss 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤣
D
liam g next?
His response to “you’re an aries”… I feel that. 🤣
This was the best thing I have ever watched in my entire life
LMAOOOOO "or some gloves" 😭😭
i would watch 4 more hours of this
best one yet hahahah
The almost kiss! Are you kiddinggg
I absolutely needed to see this
6:59 i love you Amelia 😭😭😭
Damn now i want them to date fr.
I’m not nervous I have low iron…same
this is the best date after jack harlow
"you an aries"😂😂😂😂😂oh god
that fryer oil .... yuk !
this is exactly what I feel a date with matt would be like
This was gold 😂❤
Alex Turner or Julian Casablancas next plzzzz
hahahahahah
found her match
amelia: "so, you're an Aries" 👀 matty: "oh God" *proceeds to lose his brain cells and humanity*
I have been on a million dates with a million men just like Matty I actually felt like I was watching myself circa 2013 in a weird fly on the wall kind of way, creepy
My favourite one
Nothing , nothing can top this..
I have a crush on both Matt and Amelia, don't know how to feel about this. PS we need a BTS !!!!!!!!!!!
How could you not kiss that man lmao
why does he literally have the hottest personality ever
‘Did you actually go out with Aitch’ 😂😂😂
Man 2 of Halsey's exes on here! Mind blown
was genuinely blushing for 8 minutes oh my god!! the chemistry between them is insane and it seems like my crush on matty isn’t gonna go anywhere for a long time😅
Easily the best yet. Not kissing matty… I could never. But top tier humor.
This was a whole movie plot❤ can Charlie Puth be in your show soon?
Amelia PLEASE interview louis tomlinson. if you do i will literally name my first born after you thank you!!!!!
"Why don't you buy me some iron... supplements?" "Or some gloves."  HHAHAHAHAH
you need to do one of these with Lewis Capaldi
Girl: what's your favourite song? Every guy:  " I'm in love with you" by The 1975
Hahaha this might be the best episode yet. The chemistry >>>  Matty being British also means he gets the humour so well
amelia is WAY stronger than me cause i would’ve kissed him right away
As an Aries myself, just finding out that Matty is an Aries makes so much sense
I NEED MOOOOOORE
Smile is a beautiful curve that sets everything straight.  😊
is this like the office. l dont get it
Why are there only positive comments? Am I crazy? Did we all saw the same thing? HE WAS AN AS*HOLE! make her hella uncomfortable whole interview, you can tell the ending was really awkward and he kept insisting on her after she said no many times
this has to be one of my top 3 favorites lolll
favorite chicken shop date so far, i think we all felt that sexual tension between these two.
Low iron Gang Borderline Anemic Team😭
This would totally work out , I'm loooooving it ! ❤️
I was laughing sooo hard!! This is one of the best ones!
What a load of garbage..bad acting bad script and bad delivery..trying way to hard and not even coming close
Noooo why is this so short i want moree
This was the best one because you're both on the same wave length. Haha.
teenage tumblr-era me would have died at the chance to kiss Matty 😭
How is no one talking about “so you were born in 1975” bc that made me bust out laughing
chicken shop date with harry styles next
WHERE IS DATE #2 it's already been 24 hours 😭
Shipping so HARD  I'm 29 and this turned me into a 14 years old outright
He matches the energy and takes it further 🥹
the things id do for matty healy to call me pathetic
i LOVE the bit at 3:30 like checkmate matty healy
NARDWUAR IS THE FUCKING BEST!!!!!
“Why don’t you buy me some… iron supplements” LOL ☠️😂
I'M SO GLAD AMELIA SAID NO TO THE KISS AND STOOD HER GROUND!! you go girl. it must have been pressurizing in that moment! other than that this was quite funny
"or some gloves" lmao
Oh Amelia
I actually kinda wanted to punch Amelia for not kissing Matty. He’s a fucking legend 🤣
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GOT MATTY TO DO THIS I'M LAUGHING SO HARD THIS WAS AMAZING
hes so annoying... L
that's some real superhuman power to reject his kiss.
OOUUUUUU OUUUUUU AASAAAHHHHH AHHHHAHHHHHHH OUUUUUU OUUUUUOOOOOUUUUUU AHHHAAHHHHHHAAAAAAAAH
he is such an aries man i'm sorry lol
please call him again
Pleaseeeee Do Oli Sykes from Bring Me The Horizon. He is hilarious
Periodddddddd
His hair looks so crunchy
THIS WAS SO GOOD AMELIA
the missed opportunity to turn that cigarette moment into "a change of heart" reference by intentionally lighting the wrong end omg
“You’re an Aries.” “Oh God.” 😂
Excuse me we love the too many words
I have no idea who this dude is, but this interview had me giggling from start to finish.  The way he sighed after she commented he was an Aries 🤣🤣
My favorite one ever
I really hope that it was a bit cause thatssss weird
“So you’re an Aries…” was my favourite part haha
stfu im obsessed with this video and him
"Dating  me is an art.."
She is a rude twat who needs to learn manners
dude the kiss made me so uncomfortable why did he do that...i feel like a lot of the people in the comments are just fangirling over the comments bc they're already a huge fan of him. if a person you're working with did  that would you need be uncomfortable ?
So, I’m obsessed with Matty… again
This date reminded me of why I fell in love with him😂😂😂 the way he went in for a kiss😂
Oh no this NPC needs some moisturiser
He looks 40
Need to go back to school year 7 I'll come with you girl
The forehead kiss really put him in that friend zone and I’m dying 😂😂😂😂😂 she’s so Iconic 😂
What the fuck am I watching, this is like a conversation I have with myself when I pretend I'm famous doing an interview 😂
So meta
She’s thinking about it
She looks like the girl on the ad poster behind her
made my day !
His personality is quite attractive though no?
I've never felt more mortal than after seeing Amelia refuse that kiss. She's a God.
There needs to be a second date. No question!!!
Surprised Matty didn’t know the smokes were fakes, it’s legally not allowed to smoke indoors in the UK 😂
When she pulls out the cigarette and b&w for the 1975 vibes lmaooo I love this
Go Matty give us nothing!
I DIED WHEN SHE KISSED HIM ON THE FOREHEAD
He is so insufrible. I love him.
he was so atrractive in this god help me
THIS ISSSSSS EVERYTHING
This tops Aitch….
Oh, man, please give me a crack at her!!
H as in HARRY STYLES????????
OMG I LOVE THESE TWO💗
this is the best thing thats happened in 2022
that should be me🧎‼️
If Matty tried to kiss me like that all my professionalism would’ve been out the damn window.
did you actually go out with... lol
SHE SAID NO TO KISSING MATTY?! (Unless she has a partner I guess..lmao)
7:41 🥺🤣🔥
7:37 🤣💙
"you're an aries"  "oh god"
lewis capaldi has to appear at some point.. give the people what they want
This dude is so boring
Never stop giving us your words Matty
This was hilariously uncomfortable
Plot twist, he is gay and this was a ploy.
some gloves that got me
😂😂😂😂😂❤️
“why dont you buy me some iron supplements” is my new pick up line
kind of like that strand of hair he messes with
Matty Healey!!!??!!!??? I never expected it but I love and needed it
K we can all agree this one's a masterpiece
Amelia, you genuinely may be the best interviewer. Your interviews always make me chuckle but are also insightful lol
Amelia asking for iron supplements is the kind of sexual energy I have to emulate in my own personal life
he’s weird
7:27 she defo did  when the cams were off
1:00 god damn it
One of the weirdest I’m not gon lie…can’t imagine all footage that hasn’t been released….nobody touches Amelia
My heart omg ❤
Missed opportunity to come across as clever then light the wrong end of your cigarette
Too cute.
Matty had the same reaction as me when someone starts to mention star signs 😂😂😂
This was comedy gold ❤
the self control for her to not lips matty healy when he's begging for it wow
The chemistry IS OFF THE CHARTS
this is everything
This date ended my life
It feels like I'm watching the same person talk to themselves
This is the best Chicken Shop date yet!! Matty Healey and Amelia are hilarious!! I love this!!
I am deeply, ferrally in love with Matty Healy holy FUCK
omg the slut era comment at 5:26 😭😭 lmfao
the fake cigs .... amazing commitment to the bit
“So you were born in 1975”
Please do a chicken shop date with Kehlani when she comes to London in December 🙏
I'm in love with this episode
maybe you can buy me iron supplements? or gloves…  LMFOAXHAK K
People like this are the problem
this was the best date of all. hands down on the ground
Straight violet chachki
Don't smoke
I seriously need so much more than that I need like hours of this hours
matty healy saying he invented tumblr gives me this "!!!!" feeling
i love you Amelia ❤😂
lol ive never seen amelia so uncomfortable. She finally met her match with that last bit
"low iron....that's a turn off"
These just get funnier and funnier 😂
dude i just fucking love matty and they got on so well in this😂
JESUS saves 🙌 JESUS heals JESUS forgives  JESUS loves you  JESUS restores brokenness JESUS is there for those who feel lonely or lost   ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤This world is be coming scary hold on to Jesus. WE NEED JESUS back in our homes, school, work place on the street corner please hold on to Jesus and accept him in your life before it's to late❤❤❤❤
This dude speaks like some very bad actor...
Matty saw that johnny cash quote opportunity at the beginning and took it, I have to stan
"oh god..." LMAOOO
The Chemistry is off the charts!
yesss
This was the best one yet. 👏🏾👏🏾
2:53 the way he twirls his hair reminds me of the old days of him
Hands down the best episode I’ve seen 😅
This is the funniest thing I’ve seen on the Internet in weeks. This is freakin GOLD😂
I had to do a lap round my room when he asked her to kiss him. I would of been giggling like a crazy
I would fold so quickly if Matty tried to kiss me.
This was truly a work of art
☝💯🥳
Who is this cringe cxnt
Only PUBG player contract me
Derek from "More Plates More Dates" looks a lot different in this.
Honestly I thought this show was gonna tank after the pnb rock episode ngl.
Isn’t he like Islamaphobic or sumthin?
he’s my dream guy, literally since i was 14 idc he got better with age. his mind body and soul i fucking love him LMAOO
Matty: i was born in 1989 and i'm still young and relevant. Amelia: Sure.
"You're an Ares", bro knew that was a red flag XD
I think he genuinely fell in love with you Amelia 😂
matty is too funny
사랑한다 매티…
i’m so jealous amelia
THIS IS WONDERFUL
Arrr this was brilliant
the way he said "that's pathetic" after the kiss just left me pregnant
Probably the dumbest thing I've ever watched....if "this" is what passes for humour today then count me out🙃  What a load of bollox. God todays world sucks ass!
"or some gloves" made me giggle every time i've watched this (3 times)
It's funny how matty said his personality is his least attractive trait when it's the one that attracts me the most to him
First time seen this and bloody brilliant! well done Matty for indulging with such humour!👍
This was awesome lol , i would have definitely kissed him though
My favorite lyrics are l'm in love with you. Thanks. I didn't mean you 😂😂👏
I think that date went very well.
She looks like Amber Heard
I need the BTS rn
He's like arrogantly charming lol.
convulsing
LOL
this is my new favorite video on the internet
this is one of the best of the chicken shop date. the chemistry is undeniable
i need psychologists to analyze this interview
omg this is so funny and amazing I LOVE YOU BOTH SM
I wonder how would look like a Hot girl for Matty. Loved this video. I missed him so much!. New songs are awesome!
Might be the best CSD episode so far, top 5 anyway 🐐
why is he straight? why did he say that???😡
7:08 THIS SUCH A MOVIE SCENE MATTY HEALY I CANNOT
They’re meant to be together
Is this the British version of Drake Bell?
Favourite by faaaar
honestly one of my new favourite eps
If my date doesn't buy me iron on leaving
4:52 Would you say that Amelia's got a pair of frozen hands to hold? ;)
Love so much 😭😭😭😭
How does it feel to live my dream
THE BEST chicken shop to date
Cool they vibe habahh
But did she actually go out with H tho? 🤣
Earnest kiss is scary
If only he was black he would have got a kiss
Incredible episode as usual
Beachball
my GOD
I love Amelia 😭
I think this is the best chicken shop date lmaoooo
I don't know what this is... It's very strange 😄
0:16 what did he say?
It was funny untill it got uncomfortable
I like his hand is warm and hers is cold
3:34
Amelia- “You an Aries?” Matty- “Oh my god 😒🙄” Same, I felt that Matty 🤣🤣🤣
Oh shit being familiar with both of you, I knew it was gonna be funny but that date was awesome and hilarious 😂😂
ANOTHER ONE AMELIA
I loved this
The self restraint on Amelia is crazy
I would've leaned it for the kiss so damn fast. 🥵
I’d like to apply for Matty’s type🙋🏼‍♀️
This the best date everrrrrrr
when the horoscope shit got brought up, i synched sigh with him
she looks so attractive in here
I screamed as soon as I saw who the guest was. This is hysterical, I had to pause bc I was laughing so hard at his reaction to the Aries question and saying he was born in 1975 😂 I’ve never seen anyone actually make him laugh, now I need a second date PRONTO
I ❤ u Amelia
We NEED a 2nd date!!!
just date irl already the chemistry is insane
It was nice that he mentioned tumblr. Because i got to become a fan of his from tumblr ❤
Kevin Jonas has a British cousin.
I don't know what to feel about this. One, as someone who is in love with Matty, I am destroyed. Two, as someone who is in love with Amelia, I am double-destroyed.
idk why but i would love to see Central Cee here 🤪
i have no idea who that man is but i absolutely loved this date 😂💌
What in the wattpad is this 🤣🖤
She got nervous
Who caught the Nardwuar comment?
the funniest video I have ever seen
Just read First date on the Guardian website, then watched this, then wrote this song: First dates  He was needy and confused Expected that he'd lose Slipping into oblivion He'd reframe She ordered another bottle of prosecco As his voice just seemed to echo And she struggled to remember His first name  First dates are a nightmare Of random chance Like asking at a school disco For a dance  He was mesmerised By the condescension in her eyes As he wished she'd stop Checking on her phone She considered it was likely That he wouldn't see her nightie And she'd be taking a taxi Home alone  First dates are a nightmare Of random chance Like asking at a school disco For a dance...
WE NEED A LONGER VERSION!!!!!!!!!!!!
This was boring
What is the drink?
He is so cute I can’t 🥺🥺🥺his charisma is unreal
the tension i felt at 7:22 ... i NEEED a second date 😳
WE NEED A SECOND DATE
This is phenomenal stuff lmao
this was gold start to fin
Omggg mattyyyyyy
u guys are soulmates 🥲
this was amazing.
This is too 3 definitely 👏🏼 Shoulda kissed him 💀
he looks like someone who practices a lot in front of the mirror...
Being compared to Nardwuar is a big W
AAAAA YES YES YES
OH MY GOD THIS IS THE BEST EPISODE YET
We'll be waiting for the next date... thanks!
That kiss 💋😆 Genuine British awkwardness and dating to a T. 🤭 Every teenager has had the 'kiss me now' bit in their life...Now it's out there in Matty's voice to replay over & over...👀🤤
😂 I need the uncut version immediately
Oh how I wish this was LONGER
Best one yet 😂
7:29 please. this is very cute~
Ok but I would love the full, uncut version! I didn’t want this to end!
how does it feel TO LIVE MY DREAM!!!!!!
Couple of dumbos… look like brother and sister….
the    c h e m i s t r y
This was good
Lol she was rizzing him up
THE CHEMISTRY OF A FUCKING AQUARIUS AND ARIES JESUSS
Oh my god
this exudes the same energy as between two ferns. I love it
😂😂😂  This lady is funny
this video made my whole life better
I'd describe this guy as Eggy.
I’ve never seen an interview with Matt but I’m pretty confident in saying this was one of my favorite chicken shop dates. The whole thing was gold and so funny!
“I’m not nervous I have LOW IRON” LMAOOO
Would have snogged his face off to be honest..
Get that curl out my face but said like Nacho Libre said about corn
Well this was intense, did someone turn up the heating oooft 😅
This guy is such a knob.
“Why don’t you buy me some iron supplements?” “…Or some gloves” PLEASE
It's like watching two set 8s on a date LOOOL
Amelia is not remotely funny.
I thought it was violet Chatchki at first
Ernest
This was soooo good.
Brilliant episode !! i cracked up for laugh hahha
Def my favorite one🤣🤣That was hilarious
this one, Jack, Filly and Chunkz are the absolute best dates 😂
Matty's laugh at 1:47
My boy didn't eat anything
This is so weird
Asking if he carries a moleskin is the sickest burn ever
WOW
WHY DID THIS END??
The way my whole body tensed when he wanted to kiss her??? Yeah...
I was screamin when he tried to kiss her 😂😂😂😂
I would watch an entire sketch comedy show with these two! This was comedic gold! 🤣😆
hhahahahahahahaahahhahahahaahhahahaahhaha this is toooo goooood!
'beach ball'
I really thought Amelia was gonna light the wrong end of her cigarette as a joke
Loved this date!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
This guy is the worst
10/10 interview
Matty played the player at her own game. 👑
Save Matt Healy at all costs
It’s the coolest video that i saw here on YouTube and I’m fucking jealous huhuhuhu 😢
I AM SCREAMING OMG
not matty trying to get a kiss HAHAHAHAHA
I’m jealous 😢
or some gloves 😭
This was somewhat a normal date tbh
This was better than them before sunset/ sunrise movies. Combined.
She should have lit the wrong end of her cigarette
i've only listened to a handful of the 1975 songs but GOSH matthew is quite charming. and the end where he attempts to kiss amelia got me 😳
🤍
Fucking brilliant 👏
actual comedic genius wow
Youre like the summer ahrens of british
I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
Eww he’s so slimey
Get that hair out of your eyeball ! Jeez 😬
What about the aitch question
"Your hand is warm, my hand is cold" I really expected him to break into the song "you're cold and I burn, I guess I'll never learn" 😭
She feeds white males chicken also
omfg
"Low iron? That's a turn off." 😂😂😂
omgg
Honestly their peri-peri chicken here is bomb. I love it. It's proper.
She thought about that kiss for a second thooooo
“ so you’re an aries “  “ oh my god “   needs to be on my tombstone
Probably the best chicken shop date ever. I forgot the name of this chicken shop but there was a branch of this near my student halls/uni 😜
GIRL’S GOT GAME
this is best date you ever been Amelia
Hold up. Am I being stupid or do they genuinely have a band off stage playing everything?
this has to be the best yet.
he looks like anthony bridgerton
This was ace haha
Amelia always delivers what we need 😂
She is not good looking.
Aries artists are top tier: Gaga, Brendon, Mariah, Matty, Lil Nas, Celine etc.
this is my new favorite video
thank you is what I have to say
Her just randomly pulling out the ciggie had me 😂😂
I feel like this should have been a movie
I kinda dig the vibes between you two can’t lie 😂💛💛💛
my favorite video that’s ever been made
Actually the best csd I've ever seen
i wanna see her interviewing matt smith, their energy would be hilarious!
This was gold
WHY IS MATT SO DRYHAHAAHAHAHAHA
The "dating me is an art" took me tf out!!!
I don’t know this guy but he sounds pretentious af
He seems a bit broken..... Like he'd be attracted to a woman that treats him like shit
Most successful date i guess?
That "pathetic" from Matty at the end 🖐️😭
"OR SOME GLOVES"
Amealia can definitely land this man if she has cultivated this.
I have low iron   Well that's a turn off😭😭😭😭
can't wait for date number two
More words, please 🥹!!
I think its healthy for matty to have a girl not want to kiss him
Like he will genuinely say I find you attractive and then she shoots it out of the water by saying dating me is an art 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ who does that?!?! 🤣
7:57 I hate my dad !???🤣
🤣🤣🤣 I can't decide who I'm enjoying more on this date.... Everytime I think I'm on her side, she opens her mouth and the same for him 😂 In all honesty there does seem to be a hint of chemistry between them but when there's any potential she says something stupid 🤦🏻‍♀️ I'm starting to think it's on purpose 🤷🏻‍♀️
4:56 opposites attract !??✌️♥️♥️♥️♥️😀
I think Amelia has a thing for Mancs
This is the funniest I have ever watched
just when i thought i was done with my matty healy phase
Second date please
It's pretty inconvenient, after discovering this channel a month ago, I have fallen in love with Amelia, but now after this video, I'm in love with Matty Healy as well. oh well.
how the fuck is MATTY HEALY the first guest to get a kiss on this show
Love the dry English wit
this was iconic
Holy shit
I thought she was gonna actually kiss him for a sec lol
excellent ep
Matty ❤
this is a masterpiece. it will be studied by future generations. the peak of celebrity interviews and entertainment
I LOVE HER!!
I need to see a chicken shop date with FKA twigs pleeeeeease
This guy!
Why did I feel pressured and heated when he leant over the table and smiled omg 🫣😩😍😂 brilliant date haha
I’ve never even heard of matty healy but this was one of the best chicken shop dates the purposeful awkward chemistry was unmatched AND THEN THE KISS DISBSUSNENS
matty saying oh god to amelia saying so ur an aries made me cackle
why did i actually gasp when they held hands. i know they both tried to play that cool LMAO
The best one yet hahaha
When you lit the boggie and turned black and white I love you sis
This was perfect omg
amelia is so strong, I would've folded so fast
I need these dates to be longer! 🙏
Thought she was going to light the wrong end of the cigarette 🤣
NEXT ALEX TURNER PLS
PLS GO ON A SECOND DATE
imagine Amelia and Alex Turner
THIS IS THE BEST INTERVIEW OF ALL TIME
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
cute
❤️❤️❤️
That hair dangling down his face 🤮
I enjoyed this but at the same time felt immensely uncomfortable. 😂 Kinda weird that he was trying to kiss her, playing it off as a bit...Kinda sad
ngl I was a bit disappointed with that no kiss 😂😂
It's just too good
If matty leaned in over a table to kiss me i would combust into flames and any willpower i had would be gone HOW IS SHE DOING THIS
Why does that look like Olivia Rodrigo eating a cheeseburger
Finally not a black guy
Dear lord this may be my favourite thing on the internet right now
wow this dude comes off as a major creep!!
screaming
shit i din know he was funny
I COULDN'T BREATHE THE ENTIRE TIME OHMYGOD
How did she turn you down 😭😭😭
i’m in love w this man
Omg not the lit cigarette in the chicken shop 🥴
Laughen my ass off. Gold
thank god
i love loved this! LMAO THE WAY AMELIA BLUSHED WHEN MATTY WAS GOING IN FOR THE KISS AHHH~
"This is kinda like a high Art" -- Best description of this show
you heard it here first matty healy hates anemics
I need to see all the filming footage
ancyurrrrrrrrrr
Oh my good God
I wished this was a much longer date
this was so entertaining
The kiss on the forehead!!! I SCREAMED
best thing ive seen in awhile
The gender inversion is plain to see
the only part i hate in this video was amelia telling matty to not do a podcast. he should start one, i can listen to him talking all day longgg
No other date will top this one Amelia
What an ugly guy thinking he's it lol 😆
"Hermoine don't giggle giggle."
8 years in and Amelia is more amazing every time!!
Amelia, you’re a real trooper for resisting that man 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨 lord knows what I would have done if he asked me that
anyone else kinda get little uncomfy when he wasn't taking no for an answer? yikesss otherwise hilarious as always <3 <3
What the absolute fuck is this?
There was a perfect opportunity to light the wrong end of that cigarette and now I'm sad she didn't
Third time watching this….
amelia curbing his advances at the end made me scream laugh
The cigarettes killed me 🤣
THE BEST ONE SO FAR
I’m watching this video everyday
OH MY GOD
Dodged a bullet there
I loved every bit of this 😂🥲
They have the same ears!
Insane Rizz
this is GOD TIER content. thank you.
I need more of him 🤣🤣🤣 he's such a weirdo
This has to be the best episode ever 🤣❤
I enjoy this young lady's videos
Screaming 😭
I feel like I just witnessed Matty outdoing Amelia at her own bit lol
favorite video on the internet rn
This episode is confusing meeeEEE
she had him twirling his hair
As a Canadian, I don’t understand this…
i can reach
AMELIA UPLOAD A VIDEO LES GOOO !
Literally the best one yet 😊
“You’re in your slut era” AHHAHAHAHA MATTHEW ☠️☠️
Yo, Matty Healy's date is up there with Jack Harlow's and Aitch's. Their vibes are awkwardly matching, wtf. This episode could've been the first on screen kiss 😂
why do i love them together..
Uvvv Alll the episodes I know I will watch this one over and over.  I can’t imagine how much I missed the first time round.   Never thought I’d say it, but they are a better match than with Aitch
so true.
Bravo
This is a good date. i might do this to all my date then and see who will still go on a second date 😂
Eeew. So bitter.
Please do Billie Eilish and Meghan Trainor and Lizzo
He's kinda toxic.
The fact that this woman did not kiss Matty is unbelievable, like bitch I’ll take the kiss then damn🗿💀
You see… I knew I was gonna hate this because I knew I would get agitated with jealousy from watching this woman flirt with my favorite person in the world. 😤 ugh  AND WHEN SHE GOT TO PUT THE CIGARETTE BACK IN HER MOUTH AFTER MATTY!!!🫥💀 I could’ve bursted into flames.   Anywho, Matty, you are so funny. I missed you so fucking much. You’re such an asshole and it makes me smile because your birthday is the day after mine and I swear our personalities are the same. 😂  Love,  - Your unhealthily obsessed fan ❤️
I'M LITERALLY THE BIGGEST THE 1975 FAN AND THIS IS MY HIGH STREET. HOW DID I NOT SEE THEM?!?!
- Why are you going up it? - I don't know, I wish you'd go down.  LOL
He licked his lips and everything 🙊
This was a cute date❤❤😂
hulog na hulog naman ako kay Matthew Healy HALPPPP
“This is kinda like your slut era” HAHAHAHHA
Brittany Broski is EATING THIS UP, I just know it
so you guys are dating irl right
“Or some gloves” 😂
The chemistry they have is called ✨️awkwardness✨️
best one yet
amelia’s saving the first kiss for Drake
Amelia looks especially beautiful this episode.
“Do you carry a moleskin around with you? You look like you do”
Pathetic kiss indeed 😭😭😭
I've watched this 3 times in a row now. I think I'm a little obsessed with this video.
Her voice cracking when she says "see yA"
I could watch this for an hour. Brilliant
She almost broke when he said "beach balls"
matty having an existential crisis over carrying a moleskine 😭😭😭😭😭
HE’S IN LOVE WITH HER
Invite Bo Burnham!
Matty's face was so close to Amelia's, i can't breathe
No means no man.. shit was awkward AF. but nothing will be said cause ya’ll love him.
This is SENDING MEEEEE! I wish this was longer
slut eraaaaa
Do you carry a moleskine with you? You look like you do 😂
Arctic Monkeys, next ?
Amelia is a very strong woman , I would’ve fold very easily
matty healy is the most cringy person on earth
Every part of this video is quotable istg
i feel like the one time she was genuinely intimidated by his attractiveness was when he tried to kiss her
Omgggg 🥹🤍
this is one of the top and best dates on the show. I was genuinely clutching the edge of my seat. And matty seemed like he was actually interested in what amelia was doing and was interested in the concept. Absolutely loved it ❤❤
I could never have envisioned that ending in a lifetime 💀
Hahah omg brilliant, fave so far! The kiss 🥲
this one was definitely my favorite lol
7:31 and 7:40 OMG
Oh okay, my feelings. I did not expect to feel so jealous 😂😂😂 I have watched this way too many times. Okay so when he hold her hand and they let go he slides out his hand to hold hers longer and I died also when he said let’s kiss right now he licked his lipssss YALL I AM SCREAMING LIKE I DONT HAVE A WHOLE HUSBAND AT HOME.
YESSSSSSS
“I’ve tried to cut down on the amount of words on this album”   Have you listened to part of the band, sir???
Amelia inviting my 2013 tumblr crush on a date is what I’m here for
imagine denying a kiss from matty healy???? rip
This was jokes icl
Haha the bad boy and the good girl dynamics
“I have no iron.” “You have no iron? That’s a turn off.” 😂 “Why don’t you buy me some iron supplements?” “Or some gloves.” 😂😂😂
THEY MATCH EACH OTHER SO WELL 😍✨
Always interesting to watch Amelia 😂
I’m smiling so so hard bro
Favorite one yet
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen oh my god
this was about two hours too short
These are just future tik tok sounds
wow he really invented doctor martens, beach balls, and sandwiches…never knew
What a slimeball.
the strength this woman has to deny a kiss from matty is insane. she said she had an iron deficiency but shes fucking made of it oh my god
someone said they have the same ears and i haven’t stopped laughing for some reason
When he liked his lips I knew instantly
y’all play off of each other so well this is fucking hilarious, the best one
I'd say it went well
I would have would French kissed Matt like we were in Paris.
Best video.
He outdated you lmao
Omg Amelia I always wanted to be mean to Matty thank you for letting me live vicariously thru you. “You said you wanted to do a podcast. DONT” 🫠😂
I will watch this 900 times
He’s giving major Rat energy
Matty needs to go on Nardwuar so bad
I like that I'm bit needy. He admits to being human I think that's good thing.
It's the "do you carry around a moleskin with you? you look like you would..." for me. One of Amelia's most iconic interviews
"Do you carry a moleskin around with you, you look like you would" fuck she got him good
“Your death, it won’t happen to you; it happens to your family and your friends”- arguably Matty’s best lyric
Amelia you might just stop the dates. You've found the one and only. I can't believe you didn't kiss him tho 💔😭
this is too good
His irony is just next level
Funny how I can’t hear anything they’re saying because of that curl directly in front of his eye
“I can reach” LAWD HAVE MERCY
cute af
WHY AM I BLUSHING
Best episode ever
They're so hilarious oh my god hahahahaha
This guy is a dweeb
bruhhh the whole bit with the cigarette cracked me up .. Matty going "you don't have to do this!!" hahaha... Amelia's a stronger woman than me to turn down a kiss from Matty Healy though
"I can't reach" 😆😆😆🙌 "this is like high art" 😆😆😆
Griff is quaking
Ok well the kiss situation has seemed to awaken some dormant things in me 👀 Also could this be more of an Aries + Aquarius date 🔥❤️
that was fucking hilarious
Favorite date of all time
The comment about low iron being a turn off sent me into retrograde
Damn. That guy is cringe af.
PLEASE, this is the perfect segue into a date with Alex Turner!
Well, that's it. Amelia found true love. Sad to see this series end, but its all the best for the lovely couple I suppose.
Matty Healy is such a creep wtf
This series is in disrepute
Felt weird he wouldn’t take no for an answer:/
I’m blushing watching him try to kiss her 😂
This was soo nice to watch
yeah if you and matty started a podcast that would totally suck
It’s always so strange watching British people try to make conversation
Strip burgers? Now that's new!
my favorite show + my favorite band?!?! insanely awesome
i should've known we had matty to thank for beach balls and sandwiches
matty asking amelia if she actually went out with aitch is so funny, that man is chronically online just like the rest of us dkjfhskdjfh
That kiss big gave me butterflies, you could see her contemplating 😩😩😆
This was amazing and i dont even know who he is
#28 on trending. She's just always on, she's a star
What your least attractive trait, probably my personality. Never has something resonated more!
she’s so real for this
great
Best one yet
Omg 😮
Favourite date 😍
The way she hesitated to kiss him though 😂 I’m here for all dates with funeral men, Amelia.
I am dead x
enjoyed this a lot hahahaha 💖
Why did I love this date so much?? 🫶🏼 great job!
out of all the chicken shop dates this one HAS to be the best one. wow i enjoyed every second lol Matty is really funny and entertaining and knows how to deal with Amelia
😂😂😂😂u didn't kiss him why
im so sorry but he fell in love in these 8 minutes
This one is my new favorite
Solamente voy a decir una cosa: Amelia, nosé como hiciste (?).
The ending is so awkward and the way she kissed his forehead I can’t 💀💀😭😭
am I the only one uncomfortable with him pushing her for a kiss?
His reaction when she told him his sign is literally me when people wanna talk about astrology 🙄😂
This brings me so much joy
7:51 that was awkward...
“Maybe I am”… just went I thought I couldn’t love him anymore.. he goes and quotes Johnny Cash..
He soooo wanted to kiss her Lmaooo .. she should have ! & he’s actually fucking mad attractive 🥴
The dry humour in this episode specifically is so delicious
Well that's was your best date yet! Don't know bout the cigarette though! ;)
Your hair looked amazing!
One of the things I love about her is that men often neg women as a form of flirting, but she is the absolute *queen* of negging, and I get the sense that most of her dates are intrigued.
Needed this video to be at least three times longer
If matty leaned in to kiss me you wouldn’t hear the end of it
Easily the best episode so far!!!!😂
this is culture
I knew this would be gold
I love how the production can't contain themselves
"I think 2023 I'm going to be more slutty" "Wow" That got me😂😂
the way he got close to kiss her... i couldn't be that strong like she was, congrats amelia
This was almost as good as their new album that just released! 😅 😍
part 2???? :)))
Amelia all this D your getting is going to mess up your long term relationship compatibility - And these soul ties will hold you back in life….Please stop sleeping around with all these famous people
I am crawling on the floor bc of the last bit
this is the best chicken shop date. had to pause multiple times to laugh and kept rewinding moments lolol soooo good
Okay I think this might be the best one yet
I love how I've spent the past 2 years deeply missing Matty interviews..... And then, out of nowhere, in just the past 24 hours.....there's like 5 new youtube interviews with him, one of them being a long Zane Lowe interview....and like 5 new podcast episodes where he's the guest. When it rains it pours.....     Tho I really ought to space out watching/listening to these. Alltho I already know I'm just gonna binge it all like right now.  :P
This was the most worthseeing episode you've done in quite a while.
I genuinely never wanted this to end :)))
the best episode.
Well done, Amelia! This is one of my favourites along with Jack Harlow, Yungblud and Louis Theroux.
Besttttt to date!!!!
Can we get the extended version 🙏🏻
TO BE ABLE TO DENY A KISS FROM MATTY HEALY🫠😭 THE WILL POWER AMELIA HAS 🫡
Mad init Mat knows Nardwa luke WTF!!!
this is the best one!
I don't know why but this made me uncomfortable
WE NEED A PART 2 IMMEDIATELY
Iron supplements 😂
WHY NO KISS AMELIA YOU DUM DUM
this is art
Lad thought he was getting it smh
**begins fanning self**  For me it’s the eyebrow twitching when she starts to light the cigarette 👀😍😂
"no  BISOUSS!!!!!"  flashing through amelias head
that one hair over his eye is annoying me so much
Low Iron Im dead
matty healy sucks ass. fight me
Im dead
he's no aitch tho is he
this was so good theyre both insane
matt in music video feels more like he is alive, all smile . but normal convo he has a look on his face like he is bored and in this  one probably very tired, holding hand part he is not even trying to flirt lol untill the last part when he wanted a kiss
4:50 nice nod to "settle down"
Horrible innit
Get Dave from glass animals on here
“tumblr and doc martens were my idea” he’s so self aware
They definitely deserve a wattpad novel 🌹💀✨
Well done Matt - challenged the matrix & exposed the super-flaw! Now you can kiss & mend her
I have to say out of all the dates in this one there is genuinely a connection between them
watch her be wearing some gloves in the next video haha
I could have easily watched 30 more minutes of this interview lmao
thats it this is the last chicken shop date for amelia shes found the one
i have not stopped watching this
The way I’d be SCREAMING if Matty Healy wanted to kiss me
This one is my fave!!! 1975 all my life
Well this is crazy
I know before even watching this that it's going to be everything I needed.
THE ONE TIME SHE'S MORE UNCOMFORTABLE THAN THE DATE OF COURSE IS WITH MATTY
IT SHOULD BE ME :(
I am cackling
I'd be DEADDDD if Matty said "let's kiss, for real, right now" to me 😭😍😍😍
“My personality” “mm yah” 😂
Why was this the most sexually charged thing I’ve ever watched
I want to watch it again and again
I don’t like this, it made me uncomfortable. I was thinking of them as two normal people. She uncomfortable the entire time I sensed and was just trying to stay in character to make a good video. I hope you’re okay if Matty made you uncomfortable, but if not, I love you girl and support you 🥰❤️
Amelia is too smart for this man.
i am in love with this man
this was my fav one yet
Creepy and pretentious, but made for a good video :) edit: like a second-rate Morrissey, if you can imagine such a thing.
7:18 This is like when you jokingly flirt with someone & they may or may not have seen it as banter. & you’re like, “Hold on, it was just for the craic. You know I was messing, right?”.  Obviously, this video is satire though lol.
I want ALL of the outtakes!!!
07:32 the way he licked his lips😭😭 i love him so very much i can't-
Why do I actually ship them together?! So funny together! 😂
i was giggling throughout this WHOLE INTERVIEW
Why did they cut when he asked if you dated Aitch??!!
IM SO JEALOUS
That Aries comment is the most relatable thing ever. Obsessed
this felt cold and clammy. i loved it.
ICONIC
The crossover we never knew we needed
That chicken worker is fine asf
excellent content!!!!!!
The savage, dry humour. I can’t deal 😂😂😂  4:22 A- You tweeted about maybe doing a podcast  M- Yeah A- I was just gonna say, like, please don’t  M- Yeah, no, that’s probably good advice
omggggg
i loved every second of this
thank you god the existence is true now
thanks my personality is permanently altered now
This is pure chaos. I crave it.
OMG
That single strand of hair in his face was driving my OCD nuts LOL
well, he's annoying
!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THE MOST SEXUAL INTERVIEW SHE'S EVER DONE
Dating me is an art 😆
Oh how I wish this was longer. Please post the deleted scenes.
She actually looked interested for this one
“did you actually go out with aitch” he’s just like us
My mom was born in 1989 😬
Her kissing him on the forehead instead - QUEEN
Amelia soooooo wanted to accept that kiss! 😂😢
I was just transported into a 2014 Wattpad fanfic and I loved it
I want to see the unedited version! this is the best!
THIS IS THE BEST ONE HOLY SHIT
yup this is my favorite one so far, i dont even think a drake episode could top this
I met Matty at work he was really cool and the girl he was with was so pretty
less than 2 mins in - Matty is peak insufferable
You could almost say that she pulled away when he went in for the kiss. But it wasn't a diss.
this is the best one
“you’re an aries…” “my god”
We should be talking about this more I feel
Inspiring
Matty is white kanye
I would have definitely kissed him  😍😍😍 No doubt about that.
if matty healy is begging for a kiss you know damn well i’m kissing that man
This is quite possibly the funniest one ever, I’m in hysterics!!!!!
I've been smiling the WHOLE time!!!!!!!!!! This was one of the best ones Totally ship them together Amelia you're one of my favourite people on earth
Such great comedy 🎭! 😂
Lol, might have been the worst date have watched, man acting like he don't watch her all these while to know her date with people is not some kind of deep emotional feelings.. He might have disrespected himself trying to kiss Amelia though.
For someone who didn’t pay attention in school he has a madd vocabulary 😂 I deffo can’t speak England as good as Matt
“Dating me is a art “😂😅
whys he kinda….
Love your special skills! 😅❤
This date was very spicy, I feel the chemistry Amelia!
This was painful to watch, poor Matty 🥲
A FOREHEAD KISS. it's weird cos you were a professional interviewer still but so so awkward wut
GIRL, HOW DID YOU NOT KISS THAT MAN?! He was right there.
No episode will ever beat this one.
Lmaaao “did you actually go out with Aitch” 😂
He is so fine
I want to know if she was really dating Aitch!! 😱
I need the unedited version of this
Best one yet.
‘You’re an Aries’ ‘…oh god.’  I LOVE THIS MAN.
"I have low iron" "Well that's a turnoff"
…so girls!👀…
"why dont you buy me some iron supplements" "or some gloves" LOL
it feels like amelia met her match in matty
Not people
ANOTHER DATE WITH HIM AMELIA, ANOTHER PLSSS😭😭
The sheer amount of British dry humor
her saying no to matty trying to kiss her she's so strong for that i could never
I literally FREAKED OUT when I saw the thumbnail for this video. FINALLYYYY
Omg!!!!!
Matty was a pure vibe on his date and the chemistry was top tier, give us a part 2 showing the second date now pls
I loved that and was it just me or did they find a connection.
OMG YOU GOT TO MEET MATTY & DIDNT KISS HIM!!>!>!!>>!!>
do one with madeline argy and/or central cee
Matty took ‘date’ quite literally 😅
I love matty thank you for doing this!!!
watching him match her energy and humour was so fun to watch
This was my favourite
This has been one of my favorite dates. The tension at the end! I was like “KISS!”  I’d love to see these two again.
So good 😂
Hands down the best chicken shop date
Oh my god this is wonderful on so many levels. I screamed at the part where he tried to kiss her, love it!😂🥳
first time watching damn funnyy & felt kinda giddy 😂
THE CHEMISTRRYYYYYYY
That was just perfect
ONGSBFLJSXJS I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS I LOVE HIM
kocakkkk wkwk
You have to do this with Lewis capaldi!!
when he tried to kiss her i got all giggly ❤ dear lord make a part 2 one day
BEST interview to date by FAR!!! Laughed the whole way through
I love literally everything about this. I wish it was longer!
Finally someone who can reach Amelias level
Crying cuz this was my fav chicken shop when I lived in London and now it had Matty there 😭
Please tell me there’s outtakes 😂
If Matty Healy told me I was attractive or wanted a kiss I would die!
sooo like did they go on another date ???😏
THE WAY HE LEANS FOR A KISS AND SHE JUST KISSES HIS FOREHEAD I CANT
This is the hottest interview I’ve ever seen 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nah when he got up talking bout “I can reach” BOY I would’ve risked it ALL😭😭😭
Matty is funny AF😂
This video was incredible hahah, they both have sorta the same humour and I'm cryingggg
This was so incredibly entertaining to watch. The comedy. The chemistry. Ahhh!
Best chicken one so far Dimoldenburg 😊
I NEVER EXPECTED THIS TO HAPPEN BUT I AM SO HAPPY IT DID
“you’ve gotta commit to the bit” haha :D
If there's any unedited chicken shop date I'd like to watch, it would be this one😂
i imagine that if I were to go on a date with matty I’d be incorrectly trying to play air guitar too 😭
No way you got 1975 on here big respect to you ❤🎉😢😮
matty being dry for 8 minutes
i’d like to pretend this happened because of my tiktok comment from months ago that had thousands of likes. anyways this was the best thing ever. you’re both amazing
This is the most brilliant chicken shop date to date.
I could not have loved this any more!!!!!!!
“low iron? that’s a turn off” sorry but that killed me😭😭
i feel kinda jealous
Dope Band, saw them on the Graham Norton show. Amazing how they have the same exact pair of ears.
What I would give to be that one curl
I ship
i imagine as an interviewer being told you're like nardwuar has to feel so good. love you amelia. thanks for showing yet another amazing date!!!
I HAVENT EVEN SEEN THIS YET BUT IM SO EXCITED
He was so disappointed8:02 🤣
This is so good
If they don't buy me Iron Supplements on the first date, they ain't for me! hahahah
3:35 his reaction to Aries tells me he's been grilled about that before 🤣🤣
Oh. What a subtle Johnny Cash reference at the start. Nice!
Did this work? Are they married?
This is the second video I’ve seen of hers and I think she’s absolutely hilarious and this channel is genius
Tbh would make the best couple
A new fave ❤
7:41 matty reached for her lips but she opt for his forehead IM SCREAMING and then the 'it's pathetic'.. god help me
The way they just cut off after Matty's Aitch question hahahaha
“Listen, you’re gorgeous but I’m going on tour for a very long time”. THAT is a taste of real life 😂. This show was just made for someone like him - a guy you should never date in real life but as a shameless, piquing flirt,  he’s a great time. And Amelia’s just the girl to call him out on everything - the suit, the moleskin, the genius - all of it.
them holding hands broke me
Nardwuar is a great compliment
She should have lit the wrong end of the cigarette
When the ironic personalities match, loved it lol
Hands down absolute best episode. I didn’t know there was anyone who could out-Amelia Amelia but here we are.   Matty Healy is a fucking legend.
Waiting for Brittany’s comment 😂
Idk why I watched this I’m so upset lmfao I wish I was her 😅😂😂😂😂
IM SO EXCITED OMG.
This is probably the only Amelia interview I don't care for. Not because of Amelia. She's always fabulous. Idk, Healy was trying to be all cool and sarcastic and all that. His attitude/jokes/vibe just doesn't cut it in 2022.
this is so fucking hilarious holy shit
One of the best you’ve done 😂
Amelia you met your match <3
she’s found her match
I just finished watching this and I feel the need to instantly rewatch it
This is the best date
i think this was the worst interview i’ve ever seen haha
i would kiss that man SO HARD.
They are so dry... it's that a british thing?
oh wow theyre in love
na fr at the beginning when he said he felt the real flirting until she said the bit, same I felt it too 😜😜
Oh god, Amelia I love you girl so so much. Thank you for this interview 💕
Wait why was this actually like the British version of hot ones
had me giggling and blushing
Matty genuinely believed he was on a date
“You’re an Aries?” “Oh, God.”  😂😂😂😂
when he moved closer and licked his lips … and she didn’t make a smart comment about it 🫣
this is hilarious oh my god
FUE LA CITA MÁS INCÓMODA QUE HE VISTO.  Lit Amelia se queda sorprendida al escuchar que quiere hacer otra cita denuevo<3🤭😳  that was the most awkward date i've ever seen
This is my favourite one yet
I knew I’d love this even before watching 😂😂😂
Matty is perfect for this, I love him so much. I would have kissed him in a heartbeat lol.
Buhahaha  This is soooo funny
omfg when I saw the notification gahhhadahdjsdjaskefjkbarjergsgektngkjes
I loved that 🫥
“Low iron? That’s a turn off” 😂😂
It's absolutely mental that his mother is that vile wench off Loose Women.
Just out here living my dreams.
Amelia go on a date with Alex Turner
i felt his reaction when she went "so you're an aries." thats the only accurate reaction
Also the prices aren't too bad there.
"I can reach"  major fanfic shit
Amelia he wants you
OF COURSE ITS HIS PERSONALITY
how the fuck did amelia not completely fold!?!?
Amelia you have come a long way I love your chicken shop dates I've been watching you from your first ep with GHETTS. Wish you all the best!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
pod cast would be fucking brilliant
this is the best thing IV seen, love both these guys
God I really enjoyed this. This might be one of my favourites. You guys did well together.
"Low iron? that's a turn off " got me dead
I LOVE THIS EPISODE SO MUCH
Amelia is fine asf 😭🥹🥺🔥😬😂
AHHHHHHHHHH Wow!  This was amazing
The forehead kiss. I am dead.
Now we need Alex Turner on this haha
Amelia is such an aquarius 😂
Amazing 😂
“So you were born in 1975” 😂😂😂
best chicken shop date actually
Why did this have to end
I need to see Lewis Capaldi on chicken shop date
why am I blushing????
one of my FAVVVS
Why did he keep trying to kiss her oh my god
I think Matty was genuinely disappointed at the end there 😂😂
HAHAAHA this was one of the strangest ones out of all the dates. Love it so much.
i think she knew the fangirls would hunt her down if they acc kissed 😭
matty>
Best one 😂😂😂
The will power she has to not kiss him is insane. I could never
MATTY 🥺
This is the funniest thing I have ever seen. I love you Amelia
why do i feel like he was genuine when he leaned in for a kiss
Damn.i felt the intensity through my phone. 🔥🥴
Can we get a Travis Barker & Kourtney Kardashian double chicken shop date pls?
This girl is akward
NO FUCKING WAYYY
I wish this was longer 😭
this man did not just say slut era omfg
This was hilarious
This isn’t Alex Turner. We asked for Arctic Monkeys, what is this?
LOW IRON made me lose it. Bravo - it is high art.
Just when you think you are awkward 😂😂  :::::Then you meet your boss 😂
'this is kind of like high art'.  Matty is a parody of himself 😂
I think I just fell in love w both of them
i need a part 2!!!! <3
I have no clue what the hell I just watched. But it was mad entertaining.
he seemed like every insecure dick who wants to seem cool? I love the 1975 and was excited for this interview but he made me rly uncomfortable with the end bit there continuously pushing her to say yes
I’m from Australia and have no idea who 3/4 of these people are - but I watch every time because these videos are just so incredible to watch 💕
What?! This guy is amazing lmao. They fit really well too, what the heck
I blushed and giggled the whole time
Someone go check up on Aitch
Love this ….. 2023 I’m going to be more slutty whahahah 💗🙌🏾
when matty put that cigarette on his mouth he literally transformed into a different yet the most familiar person ever
What i would do to kiss matt healy
This interview was one of my absolute favorites. No idea who the man is, but the two of them together is hilarious!
I wish this was longer lol
This was uncomfortable to watch lol
I just started watching these and theyre hilarious.
Kissing him on the forehead was such a power move. You've probably derailed his love life for a solid 6 months !
This is absolutely brilliant
“you don’t need to do this” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
OMG the way he looked at her when he wanted a kiss 😶‍🌫
The way Matty committed to the bit was everything 😂😂😂
My man was THIRSTY for that kiss OMG
crying screaming pissing myself
oh carolina ? no, it's oh amelia ! ugh !
Idk who he is cause I’m from US but he is to die for
Or some gloves LMAO
Thank you for doing this 🌻🤝🏾
JUST MARRY😭😭😭😭
Best yet?
Nah because I would have folded if he said “I do genuinely find you quite attractive” to me
This is the best thing to ever happen.
This is so funny. I want more! Hahaha.
i could watch this 100 times over
Matty with a cigarette is just iconic and too normal too see 😂
not me self inserting as amelia in the end
"I'm like a really good flirter, as in like that's one of my special skills, I can do..." 😂
💕🍗
i think amelia has finally found someone who matches her humour effortlessly
“Well that’s a turn off” made me die 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sl*t Era. LMAOOOO
Did he actually leave?
😂😂 fake cigarettes
Amelia you’ve definitely found ur soulmate now
I can’t tell if he’s breaking the fourth wall or if it’s all a part of the bit 💀
Great episode
Finally someone tried doing an "Amelia" on Amelia
How he looked her intensely in the eyes and asked her about aitch 😂
Is that violet chachki out of drag??
LMFAOO 😭😭😭
This was so unexpected
One of the funniest for sure
You could of asked him about his time being an extra on Waterloo road
❤️🔥
If I were Amelia, I’m ginna go for that kiss!!!
This may be the best one EVER. Y’all have to go on another date!  PLEASE
Why is no one talking about the Aitch 😅
i knew matty would absolutely ace this date 🤣
You shared an indirect kiss via cigarette! It’s love I’m sure
This is the best show, i laughed so much
oh my god
I’m in love you I I I I I’m in love with you
This was cute. :)
he feels toxic to me.
first time here, and i swear this is the most interesting interview EVER. i barely hold myself from laughing because it's 1.41am here!!! def subscribed
If Matty Healy tried to kiss me I would have done it IMMEDIATELY 😭💀 when she said no I gasped and died
Brilliant ❤
You two are definitely in love!😂
Let’s kiss right now bdjdjdjd the most aries thing to say
Eggcelent chicken shop episode.
OMGGGG THE END!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If they´re not in love well, I AM 😭
Why don’t you buy me some iron supplements 😂
Dude if he told me let's kiss for real !!! I wouldn't know how to act and I'd just won't stop 😭😭😭
I love that matty Healy is the only person to out awkward Amelia
Loveddddd this
Has anyone ever taken you on a real date like off camera
How did you not kiss Matty? You have the steadfast constitution of a soldier. Only professional, no romance! We weep for you Amelia.
I loved this. Amelia is just the best. Why isn’t she on prime time tv?  😊 He was pretty funny, too!
i want to be amelia so badly 🥲
Carmen (in character) from The Bear should come here next.
good luck in 2023 amelia! 🥳🍆
I adore his personality ✨ just like his songs
Nardwuar comparison....that's a great compliment.
i need more omg
"I was born in 1989, and I'm still young and relevant." Literally what I say to myself every day 💀
OMFGGGGGGGGGG
This should have been longer
Amelia was 5 cm away from being the inspiration behind Robbers 2
unstoppable force meets immovable object
ok this is the best one
"OR SOME GLOVES" classic respect!
BEST DATE YET 🖤
the chemistry was sooo good like it actually gave flirtatious energy and he’s hot
this was pure GOLD
🤣 love this
7:30 not him licking his lips as well, my man was serious
Amazinggggg✨🙌🏼
i do find this very funny but the problem is that i'll go and flirt like that in the real world and ppl are gonna say I'm mean but they dont get it that it is in a chicken-shop-date-kinda-humour
This was beyond awesome.  Well done
OH MY GOD GIRL HE WAS INTO YOUU
omg? a literal fucking masterpiece. i didn't expect the chemistry wth. DO MORE OF THIS WITH HIM PLEASE. THIS ISN'T ACTING ANYMORE
Honestly one of my favorite ones !
Wow that was the most awkward interview ameli are you okay?
The Aries reaction, the kiss tension, high art people!!!
Amelia I could of cried when you didn’t say Marty’s best lyrics are ‘I’m sorry but I’d rather be getting high than watching my family die’ 😪😪
hope he smashed.
Amelia can pull any man she wants GO AHEAD GIRL!!!
This actually beats out Harlow and young blud holy hell historic
the serious concern in his face when he says "you dont need to do this"🤣
I love the lesson she gave him "Don't smoke" ♥️
I never would’ve thought I’d see the day that to my two favourite Brits are on a chicken shop date.
fuc*kkk off what i’d do to be her
miu miu 💕
AMELIA!!!!! Wtf 😂 WHY DID’NT YOU KISS MATT!!!! 😭😭😭
Idk why "Doctor Martens" sent me through the roof
‘You were coming across as clever than you lit the wrong end of your cigarette..’ 😂❤️
was so excited to watch and it did not disappoint!!! their energies were a great mix as well!!
OUTSTANDING.
That was funny
Amelia: Why don't you buy me some iron supplements? Matty: Or some gloves 😂
THE KISS
Best date so far!
dang this girl is funny as fuck, literally 10/10 personality
PLS
Matty: My favourite lyric at the moment is I'm in love with you. Amelia: Ohh, Thanks. Matty: No, I wasn't talking to you, I was just saying. 😂😂😭💔
The best guest ever I can’t wait to watch 🫶🏼🫶🏼
Bring Alex Turner on here 😂😂😂
am I wrong or is there an 'n' missing in 'Chicken Inn' at 0:36?
I know Jack fell to his knees after seeing this
This is one of the best dates she's been on for sure...so intense and bordering on creepy from Matty
Hehehe he said “I’m straight” that’s a good joke he made there
i can reach
Damnit who also thought they were gonna kiss 😆😆
This is so funny. I bet Zane Lowe got paid a fortune for kissing Matty's ass n she's nailed it in under 10 mins...Zane Lowe needs some tips from her.
He’s straight? 💔😩
GIRL RUN
The kiss lean in made me nearly pass out
I’ve never NEVER NEVER CLICKED SO FAST
well that was all just outrageous
Matty begging to be kissed at the end took me out 😭
7:32 the way i would fold immediately if he did that omfg
"you have low iron. that's a turn off" BAHHAHA I'M FUCKING DEAD
holding hands AND kissing???? is this a joke
Omg she's in love...
THE BEST EVER EPISODE OF CHICKEN SHOP DATE.
I like how well-dressed he is for the date!
I feel like he did acc genuinely want to kiss her at the end
“They’re FAKE cigarettes?!”
Because ofcourse matty healy calls docs “doctor martens”
This is perfect ❤
Looking for brittany broski in the comments 😂😂
Watching this interview was like edging
They belong on the IT crowd.
Its really feels like a date
They look like the royal guards who don’t see the enemy attack because they ran into the fields to prove eachother wrong with some kind of running techniques
Wait, is it just me or does Matty Healy kinda look like Tyler Joseph?
HAHA LOVED THIS ONE! She knows how to write scripts🙌🏻💖
i love this so much
That stand of hair drooping in front of his eye is twisting my nut! Am off that guys a straight trumpet!
This is so hilarious lmao🤭🤣 Ever since I've discovered these videos my life has improved drastically lmao😂there's something about her that makes me laugh everytime. Her brand of humor is truly unique and one of a kind.
They seem like the good two evil villains watching the kingdoms towers while the enemy sneaks in slowly without their knowledge because they’re too self involved with each other. It’s so great
Slut Era 😭😭😭😭
amelia... the willpower you exhibited in this video......
BAHAHA THE FOREHEAD KISS I CANT
Everyone basically comes on these now to ask her if she actually dated Aitch 😂
oh my fucking god
My new favorite! Please make an episode with Tyler, the Creator! That would be absolute chaos
Amelia just sat there and got Matty Healy to fall in love with her in 8 minutes. We just wanna let that sink in.
He was SO ready to kiss you. Girl you should have gone in for the kill 😂
THE KISS BIT LMAO he’s so fine
This the best one yet
This was so awkward, absolute class
I’m having heart palpitations cause of the end omg
“You an Aries?”  “Oh god”   Matty immediately wanted to leave 😂
Screaming in white noise
this was the best one yet!! i def saw the chemistry between y’all👀👀
This guy has a great voice. He should start a band or something
"Dating me is an art." YESSS!!!
a tired widowed father tries to reconnect with his precocious teenage daughter
iconic
Best one yet! Dunno who he is but he gave you a run for your money 😂😂 Quality!
I don’t want it to eeeeeeeeeend 😅
This guys hilarious🤣
i feel like matty really lost the opportunity for an "you're cold and i burn" moment there
Did he just called dj KHAled irrelevant? Because period
Matty outchea asking the NB Q’s - Did you actually go out with Aitch? 😂😭
Amelia , tbh I pretty much ship you with anyone ever because you have such great chemistry with every person you’ve been on a date with, but this.. this is on another level, I’m waiting for the second date!❤
7:42 THE FOREHEAD KISS AHHHH
"oh yeah! funny and interesting's cool."   why did that send me 😂😂😂😂
so excited 2 watch this
this was too short!!! come on.....
Amelia does NOT kiss on a first date!
Favorite one so far 😂❤😂❤😂❤
When he was coming in for the kiss, I have absolutely no idea how u coped but the forehead kiss was a power move
This is right up there with the chicken connoisseur episode. Both taking turns to act like they have no idea what's going on is gold
GOLDEN
OH MY GOSH
Matty's bringing the heat!!!!! He's out Amelia-ing Amelia 😂😂
YAAAAAAAASSS!!!!!!
A sad day for the gays lmao
Sarcasm vs Sarcasm 😂
damn its short
i literally could watch an hour of this this is amazing
hahah this is amazing
i unironically ship this
Oh look it’s the racist guy with the weird mum.
matty healy looks like harry styles if he did crack
This was genuinely one of the funniest episodes.
he's for real unpleasant to watch
absolutely gutted that he's hetero but you really should go on a date with Nardwuar so he could tell you all about you 🤣
This is golden
Heeee wanted to kiiiiisssssssssssssssssth
I feelcas if we're kinderspidirits
Love love love.
she turned down a kiss from matty healy???????
bae
poor girl was genuinely shocked at the kissing bit
Brittany Broski is seething.
Can we get Alex Turner for the next week? Arctic Monkeys are releasing the car... Just saying.
THE PERFECT MIX
This has to be the best guest yet
this was so silly
I LOVED THIS LFMAO
- I have low iron - You have low iron?? - I have low iron -….That’s a turn off FBMHFVBHESSSCHJUUF
- I have low iron - You have low iron?? - I have low iron -….That’s a turn off FBMHFVBHESSSCHJUUF
This interview is pure gold 🤣💗🙏🏽
THE KISS LMFAO "THATS PATHETIC"
THIS IS THE BEST DATE!!!
They’re fake cigarettes AND YOU STILL TURNED DOWN THE KISS?! 😭 for real though this was amazing the chemistry between you two is ❤️‍🔥
There was so much chemistry that Amelia broke character several times
Amelia: ...so you're an Aries  Matt: ......oh god  😂😂😂
this might be one of my top chicken shop date along with aitch lol the chemistry was so entertaining. love how matty was asking about the other dates and amelias slut era lol
color grade on this >>>
That look at 4:48 😍
thank you
NO WAY DID MATTY CALL YOU OUT ON YOUR AITCH RSHIP AND YOU CUT THE VID....
Matty brought his A game 😂
😂 love this!
i didn’t think any of your interviews could top you and jack’s but this is incredible you are the funniest person ever never stop doing these
uhhhh he turned it around... now look who felt awkward. That was funny as hell. He would've kissed you hehehehe
Favourite Aries! I’ve met him twice and he called me darling and I basically died! I’m sad I couldn’t get tickets for their 2023 tour tho 😭😭😭😭
Eh how is he Tim Healys' & Denise Welshs' kid
i demand a part 2
I LOVE THIS EPISODE
this is special
Im internally screaming for 8:23 straight
Boo to smoking
Broo I screamed when he said “let’s kiss right now”
Slut era 💀This was so fun
It’s giving Between Two Ferns in the absolute best way 💀
i think i died when he leaned in for the kiss
His eyebrow twitch at 6:23 🤣🤣😭😭
dude you passed up the opportunity to kiss that man… i would’ve passed away
Oh myyyy
"No i'm not nervous, i have low iron" 😭
My god he is gorgeous 🥵
This was so funny
She shared a cigarette with Matty Healy. I’m forever jealous😭 And then she didn’t kiss him so maybe I’m not jealous anymore
New favorite date alert like the man is literally in love
I never try to ship real people, but… I ship it.
Estoy celosa ahora
YALL I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW THIS
Here when this video went private 😌
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Whens the wedding?
I’m crying 😂😂😂
even I'm pregnant after watching that
my man asking the important questions
totally loved it, wish this was longer tbh
I’m so in love with this episode 🥹🫶
The best episode, by far!
How could she have not kissed him
Ahahahahahahahahahah funniest one yet!!
Honestly would love to see a second date hehe
amelia: this is a lesson... DONT SMOKE. me smoking while watching this: 💀
BRO HIS FACE WHEN SHE SAYS “YOU’RE AN ARIES” 😭😭😭HE’S JUST LIKE ME FR
Did anyone else notice Amelia say Lizz Trust instead of Truss? No? i'll pretend I didn't hear it
If you wanted to really come across as clever you should've lit the wrong end of your cigarette 😏
5:26 lol
when chaotic good meets chaotic evil
This might be the best promo Matty has done for a new album to date. He was made for this show 😂
I knew Matty was gonna flirt endlessly with her. Btw for a moment i thought they were gonna kiss for real
4:57 😭
Girlll you had chance to kiss him😭😭😭 tell me you kissed him behind the camera
Put Phoebe Bridgers on next. Your humor and hers will be an epic episode
amazing
Al principio no entendí y al final tampoco
i need him
Date with 50 cent would be 🤯
"or gloves" lmaooo
Hey come on I'm tryna be next
It's like two meta sarcastic AIs trying to simulate a date and I'm here for it
I never thought a thing as awkward chemistry could exist and yet here we are
7:36 .... ill lose my shit its like straight outta a movie
Amelia did you post this from the afterlife?
This was one of the best ones so far 🤣 Amelia you’re a gem
i say it everytime but THIS is my favorite chicken shop date
Did he weird out amelia😂?
On a date with trigger in his Halloween uniform.....if you know you know 😜
Why was I giddy when he leaned in for the kiss, I’m WEAK 🧎‍♀️
🤭omg
‘Ive low iron’ ‘Well that’s a turn off’ 😭😭😭
I would l o v e to see a chicken shop date with Emma Chamberlain + Amelia!
This might be the best. 😂
“Tomorrow belongs to people who prepare for it today.”
My opinion of him just 180d
the chemistry!!!!
"this is kinda like your slut era" matty healy 2022
she just rejected kissing him, omg
Imagine having the audacity to refuse a kiss from Matty Healy
“So you’re an Aries.”  “Oh, god.”
Didn't know i needed this video
loved it!!
THIS is what we have all been waiting for. 10/10 date. Please get married.
“Do you carry a moleskine around with you?” “You look like you do” lololol  “In 2023 I’m going to be more slutty” 😂😂😂😂
4:53 the way he said nervous did smth to me
I need you to go out with king krule 😩
I just imagine I were you Amelia 🥹
….no….. 😂😂😂
This is my new favorite video ever! Thank u for this
HOW DO YOU NOT KISS HIM IM SORRY AMELIA BUT YOU FUMBLED THE BAG ON THAT ONE
This is incredible
Oh my god this date was iconic 😂
I love this
Get Alex Turner on here !!!
its the "we can help you stop smoking patch" ad before the video for me hahahahahaha
Finally i’ve been waiting for this! Didnt know it was going to be so soon!
THAT. KISSING. SCENE.
She should have lit the wrong end of the cigarette!
3:15 amelia can't hide her genuine amusement lol
Please go on a DATE WITH BAD GYAL♡♡♡♡
This was so good they complimented each others humor so well it got weirder and weirder ahahahahah
Oh my god. THIS MAN
omg Yas amelia we love this next one with Grian please
And I thought the Zane Lowe interview was great! 🙌
I really can’t tell to what extent he’s being serious or not - is he usually like this?
I don’t know who this guy is but this has been the best date in ages 😂😂😂
I still listen to chocolate every now and again. Classic tune
Amelia is stronger than me because I’d have folded when he suggested a kiss
Aitch has legit competition
God his accent😩😩
Amelia this is the one!!!!😂♥️♥️♥️♥️
that kiss bit got me dead
I saw the clip on TikTok and I came right over 😂
thank you for this amelia
I can't stop laughing 😂😂
"I was born in 1989 and I'm still young and relevant." I was also born in 1989 and share these sentiments.
alex turner next
It's actually a personality match
I absolutely Love Matty I would absolutely love to just sit down and rack his brain because he is so intelligent and what he comes off with is inspiring and deep I adore him. Matty is the best You’re so lucky….Pmsl when you said You’re a Aries and he went god lol 😂 Matty is so genuine actually love all his mannerisms and everything.
Bahahahaha
Matty matching Amelia's energy was hilarious.
He looks knackered and swollen not as hot as he used to be lol
He’s a right wanker🤣
YOURE AN ARIES 💀💀💀
Amelia darling, if Matthew Healy asks for a kiss, YOU GAVE HIM A KISS AMELIA
Ahahahha 😂
She thinks Liz Truss is good company. Instant red flag.
I know Amelia is built different because I would have CRUMBLED is matty healy behaved like this in front of me
Another iconic date!
Brilliant ☺️
one of the best ones no doubt ! wow
I feel like this was one of - if not the best - dates Amelia has done.
THIS IS KINDA LIKE YOUR SLUT ERA PAHAGXVSGSYWHSK
Omg that was absolutely amazing I will watch this many times again this is the kind of quality entertainment i came here for, pure gold HAHA
Amelia playing the guitar 😭😭😭😭😭
this is the most british thing ever
matty trying to kiss amelia is going to destroy the internet
What an ephemeral delight this date was to witness. Amelia you are a journalistic genius 💕🍗
thank you for your service Amelia 🫡
The way he actually went in for a kiss and she just swervs and kisses his forehead 😭😂
Finally someone I know on Chicken Shop date!
This man has immaculate vibes
Was I the only one screaming at the possibility of Amelia and Matty kissing?!! 😭
never heard of this guy but he was awesome.
YOU KISSED HIS HEAD? amelia get it together
Not the best looking is he. Despite the confidence.
Amelia Dimms - Really Good Flirter 😂
MATTY HEALY OMG
'or some gloves?'  😂😂😂
Liz "trust" 😂
Amelia is a dime
If Amelia isn’t my best friend in exactly 1 year I will be devastated
OMG OMGGGGGGGGGG!
This is Amelia’s ‘The Rehearsal’ - the subject has become too aware of the meta
this is one of the funniest ones yet😭
damn he really got curved by Amelia 🤣
my absolutr fav thus far
This is the best one ever
it seemed like he believed the genius part a little too much for it to be a bit
i didn’t hear innovator i heard “i’m an elevator”
'it's like nardwuar' huge compliment and very true to amelias talent
Amelia if you don’t release the footage after you cut AFTER ALMOST KISSING HIM
Please help, Matty turned me into a puddle of human soup 🫠
OH MY GOD this was amazing ... amelia didn’t know how to deal with the intimacy AND stonewalled him at the same time. “so you’re an aries” was a gold moment. amelia, you’re a gold moment.
So good 😊
Brilliant. Indy bands could be a whole new avenue 😂
Nah
I feel like I shouldn’t be watching this
이 정신나간 걸 나는 왜 계속 보고있는거야 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
This is actually the funniest thing I’ve seen I just love how funny Matty is I also really love the band 😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅
Omg slskskkskss the ending THEE ENDING i am feelingthingssssssss
"it's pathetic" got me extra hard
Matty saying he can reach in far enough to kiss, is not something I expected to hear but now I have, it will forever be in my memories 🙂
She's so cute i luv her
I never wanted this to end
ooooooo saucy amelia
i love this so much
Tell me why I felt like I was intruding at some point lol
These two though 👀👀👀
Being 100% biased, this is the best date to date.
My worlds are colliding
im blushingggg with this ending
"With H?" Harry?
This was defo my favourite date! Leaving us on that aitch hand me dead 😂
3:34  Amelia: You’re an Aries. Matty: Oh, God…
honestly I really don't know if he have the worst personality on earth or if he's a genius
She’s funny
“im still young and relevant”    “…sure”
'youre an aries'  'oh god'
“Why don’t u buy my some iron supplements” that is very wild thing to say on a date 😂😂😂😂😂
This was very ew. Correction: He was very ew
This was awesome 😂❤
THIS IS SO FUNNY
The editing is just so good 🤣 And I think you two might be in love 😭
GIRL HE WAS INTO YOU UNTIL YOU SAID HE WAS IN ARIES 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
omg the kiss part why am I blushing for her 😭
Alex turner needs to be the next.. Please amelia..please..🥺
I was holding my breath for the kiss. Jesus.
Oh my god this is the interview I always needed
amelia is so much stronger than me for not accepting to kiss him, she got that man giggling and twirling his hair
How lose do we reckon she is?
I panicked when he tried to kiss her. but also when she said 'so you're an Aries' and he just died a little inside. Id have the same reaction lmao
My low iron queen I hope you got the supplements!!!
The hold this man has on me is concerning 🥹
Hey everyone....this date was very fun, I am trying to work out how i feel about Matty, i feel like we are probably in love. Will update you if we get that second date. Over and out my friends!!! <3
"DON'T smoke." 💀💀💀
This was absolutely everything I needed it to be
This is beautiful
Nadwaur 😂
I fookin love this blonde white woman. come to Australia now
oh mattys loose hair couldn't hear what he was saying without staring at it
wow the sexual tension in this one was just wow
get seb vettel on
Probably my personality 😛😛😛
please the way matty stares amelia down :'))
And you were coming across as clever then you lit the wrong end of the cigarette. That part with Amelia lighting the cigarette and his reaction reminded me of this lyric of his😂
Both as weird as each other you guys made the best match ❤
Need this relationship to happen, the comedic content we would receive?? Life changing
This was bloody brilliant. Best chicken shop date!! Matt is hilarious 😅😂
Lol
Nardwuar getting the love he deserves !!!
matty moving closer to amelia for a kiss killed me omg 😭😭😭😭😭
Glad she put in the title ‘The 1975’ otherwise I wouldn’t have had a bloody clue!! 😒
i have low iron Dont 🤣😂😅 glad he recognised this as high art lol
Absolutely Phenomenal.
this is one of the best yet, her awkward humor mixed w his directness makes for hilarious chemistry
OMG WHEN HE TRIED TO KISS HER IM GONNA DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I have low iron 😩. Girllll same!! On the anemia struggle bus over here.
Aww a 🎉❤😊
Can’t believe she didn’t kiss him 🤣 how dare you Amelia
But why does the video cut to random shop stuff? :D
"I just have low iron" "well that's a turnoff"😂😂
this is unironically the best thing i've ever seen in my life
I thought this was Violet Chachki out of drag 😂
BEST CHICKEN SHOP DATE EVER
I really wanted her to kiss him!! I would not have been able to say no or just kiss his forehead😂😅
THIS IS THE BEST MOMENT EVER I CANNOT BELIEVE SHE IS ON CHICKEN SHOP WITH MATT ANDDDDDDD HE SAID HE FINDS HER ATTRACTIVE SWOON
this is amazing
"why dont you buy me some iron supplements?" "or some gloves"  i cant with these two 😭
matty healy is the kind of guy who gives the bare minimum then says they want to go on another date with you
i was literally screaming the whole time
3:37 his “Oh, God” KILLED ME
Not the cut after “DID YOU ACTUALLY GO OUT WITH AITCH” 😂
Fantastic.
"why don't you buy me some iron supplements" amelia has such a way with words. her flirting skills are truly unmatched
THIS IS EVERYTHING to me
is Brittany here yet?
for the clowns who don't get it this is a joke
AMELIA YOU DID NOT JUST FOREHEAD KISS MATTY HEALY
5:26 Amelia and I have the same 2023 goals.
I Love your Chicken Shop Date Videos Amelia every Friday❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💑💑💑💑💑💑💑💑💑
