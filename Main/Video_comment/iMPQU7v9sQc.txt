On the corner where van dijk scored Trent showed his ass
Rip jota🕊️❤️🫶
Arnold butt
people who went to that game 👇
I do not want Juergen kloop to leave
Liverpool will win the premier league and champions league
Endo is the Japan player in the world
Trent and snoboblazki is on fire
Darwin hit the post all the time
Virgil van and Johan cruff is amazing
Mo salah is the best Egyptian player in the world
We need to stop wasting the amount chances we miss
Could the irish keeper be our players of the season
The tackle from Nunez at the end was so good 😂😂YNWA I ❤❤😢
Liverpool is on fire this season keep it on
What a match!!!
Alexander showed the world 😂
how are liverpool top on this form ? gomez and mcallister are liabilities, nunez cant' score. they look like they struggled against another bottom of the table team
Go to this second it cracked me up 😂😂😂😂 0:56
Nuñez just really isn't great. He doesn't really fit
Von dake? And shozelie
Why is there a bird commentating on this game
Is it just me or was she saying Virgil von dake
Both goals were fouls.
both goals were fouls, why no booking & disallowed goals?
Please stop women commentating on men’s football. Women are playing football to a good standard, please go commentate on that.
Liverpool winning nothing
Well done to Ahmedhodzic for not wearing that stupid armband they are making them wear👍👍👍👍💪
Did you see TAA but
As soon as I hear a woman commentator you just know the highlights will be ruined.
Trent is taking ASSisting to the next level
Trent is world class has been since he made his debut you dont win a premier League champions league fa cup league cup super cup club world cup by the age of 23 while been one of the best players doing it , the modern wing backs first role is to attack and give the team a outlet on the flank dinosaurs think a rbs job is to defend first this isnt the year 2000 anymore the game has changed ,he has 103 goals and assists in 316 games thats better than most of your teams wingers
IM A FOREST SUPPORTER OF NEARLY 50 YEARS JUST WATCHED THAT FABULOUS TACKLE BACK FROM NUNEZ TO CROSS THE BALL FOR SECOND GOAL HES A BRILLIANT FOOTBALLER LOVE HIM 🎩⚽🥅🏐🌈⚔️😂💥❤️🚬🛡️
Why does she pronounce Van Dijk "Van Dayk"?
what a recovery challenge from Nunez
0:57 Cracks beginning to appear in Sheffield United's defence:) (You know what I mean)
Vvd showing his class ynwa
That ASSist was cold
I support liverpool but honestly I think archer motm
Wat it is with women commentary bye can’t watch
That was a crack of a corner from Trent, a real cheeky one. 😂
had to mute it over the commentary. u know what  im saying
Trent HAS to start for England in the Euros next summer. Just get him in there, don't care how.
Commentator renamed him Von Dijk 😂
Man City putting a bid in for Leon in January 😂😂
Who's this Von Deak guy?
Van dijk is showing how good of defender he is and he's miraculous
Trent but was out a cracking assist by him
Why, when injured after being fouled, did Mac Allister have to go off the pitch for 30 seconds? 🤔
Great work from Nunez, we have to get rid of all this rolling around from players like they are taking their last breathes, whoever that Sheff Utd player is he needs naming and shaming
This commentator pronounces "Van Dijk" very well!
Love Nunez, he always creates panic and hopefully there's much more to come from him.
Stop showing the each points scored on title
Kellher world CLASS!
thats a CRACK ING pass trent
Sh%te that gomez
Stop female commentators its ruining the watching experience
What a wonderful goal by Virgil van dijk
Both challenges are fouls if they wear red and white 🤷🏻‍♂️
Scrappy game, was worried for a while, some good forward play and good defensive performance by Sheffield, fair play!!!
2 fouls by lfc 2 goals should have been disallowed
why she say can dojo do weirdly
0:57 Cheeky Assist, and a cracking goal
excellent save by Kelleher
It's funny to hear people talking about the "fouls" before Liverpool's goals when you look at what Sheffield United got away with. Mac Allister is now out injured after having his knee stamped on and one tackle on Konate was a wrestling hands clasped bear hug! Every single corner, they were fouling and diving. Is that Chris Wilder's big idea for survival?
Foderingham so underrated
City got so lucky it wasnt 4 - 0
Trent is world class
Liverpool could of done better😢
Can we stop havin female commentators for a men’s game. They sound like 11 year old boys.
Was not the best performance  from LFC, but what impressed me was how well Endo and Szobo kept their energy levels up to recover against Shef UTd counter attacks and support our CBs  Gomez made an error but he did not give up. He tracked back and that gave Trent a chance to add pressure on one player and Kelleher made a damn good save.  VD was looking good defensively.   The fact a defender won Man of the match shows how key defence was in that match. Then again Sallah and Nunez had chances to bury that match and… ya.   Both goalies made good saves and Shef Utd captain Ahmedzovic defended well. He too I felt was a contender for MoMatch along with Archer.  Ref did good. Not gonna say a lot. Might jinx the rest of other fixtures to come!
👍
what is with that Liverpool kit ??
Burnley scored more than Liverpool
0:56
Sad to both have the screeching monotone woman's voice commenting and Virgil wearing the colors of occupation on his arm.
Wow. Where was Sheff utds defence for that last goal?? 😂🤦
Sheff utd improved a bit. They only looked bad instead of absolutely shocking.
Who is Virgil Von Dake????? 😂😂😂
I love how casual Van Dijk is with his finish. Chilled celebration too 😎
Nunez proving why people who focus on the misses chances are being reductive. His workrate and physicality gets us the goal to seal the game, and he is getting a lot smarter in his overall game. The shot conversion will improve.
“Virgil Van Deyk”
Spoilt by the commentary again.
VIRGIL VAN WHO
How is Robyn cowen allowed to commentate
And Van Dijk gets the final touch!! It was the only touch straight from a corner. Go & wash some pots.
Job done👍
I don't know why but that pronunciation on van dijk wound me up
Can’t stand female commentators
Pre injury van dijk is backkkkk🔥🔥🔥💙💙💙
Sheff United fans actually think wilder is gunna make a difference 😂😂😂😂
Thing is Liverpool play so much better with Nunez, yes he misses chances but he’s doing bits, people expect a goal a game
Perfect pass by Nunez!
What is that Liverpool strip like lol
Now, if a player is tackled, they will instinctively collapse on the ground and play for a foul. They're not injured, just embarrassed that they had the ball taken from them. Same goes for a player whose shot on goal goes wide. They instictively claim that it took a touch to go out for a corner but they know that they're only doing it to save face.  It's a damn shame because there's some amazing football being played right now.
Darwin, Darwin, Darwin! Fantastic attitude and well picked out Slobo! And welcome back Virgil.
Cracking assist by Trent
Nice ASS-ist from Trent
Not a great performance by us, but another 3pts in the bag. Next stop, Crystal Palace with yet another 12:30 KO!
How is the Nunez challenge on Bogle which lead to the second goal not a foul?
What was the Sheff Utd player doing on VVDs goal? He did about 14 rolls from no touch!
Great tackle and assist for Darwin. Should have scored earlier
What a tackle from Nunez 👏🏾 class
2 goals 2 fouls in build up ,neither overturned.   At least prem is showing how its consistent with its terrible use of var.
What's with the rainbow armbands everywhere?????????
What a FIGHTER NUNEZ is 🔥🔥🔥
2 blatant fouls for both goals
Listening to her commentate is like nails along a chalkboard.
Darwin’s assist is the most him passage of play I’ve seen, he kinda messes up, then hustles like a mad man, produces a class tackle and then a really perfect ball. It’s why we love him.
Liverpool are right in the mix right now but i still think we're one or two players short. I still don't think Liverpool are firing on all cylinders though. Some excellent players who can definitely go up a few levels. Scary thought if Liverpool do really click. They'll be very hard to stop.
What's with the mixed commentary really ?
Cannot stand seeing a player rolling around on the floor, cheating, when his team are defending (2nd goal for Liverpool here). Whoever he was totally let Sheff Utd down - he lost the ball fair and square and yet chose to cheat instead of trying to win the ball back.
TERRIBLE defending, easy work for Liverpool
Good result. Endo played well. Sarah's 200 th goal is coming.
why does the woman commentating call VVD "van dayk" like bruh
Liverpool will win the league
nunez has to go he misses the easiest chances
Great stuff from Liverpool, looking a bit more stingy defence wise and just able to nick some goals and then hold on to that lead .  They're looking more assured so far this season
I'm sure liverpool wudve scored eventually anyway but how is that not a free out for 1st goal ??
Bird on comms = mute
Trent is world clASS
Blades marking for the first. 😂😂😂
A truly professional performance which could of been a potential banana skin against a lower position side ,add on their uplifting confidence booster from the returning manager ...so the  great 2-0 win blunted the blades  & in my view was a fantastic result !
Something big going on at villa.
Who is this women commenting?? 😒
We the Liverpool are the best
Even with the touted midfield upgrade, Vvd getting back to his best that made it harder for the team last season, and trent playing with more freedom that has unlocked another level, we have trouble scoring, we try to pass it around and around in the final 3rd and we struggle. We shoot alot, create alot of chances even last season with the aging midfield we create alot of chances but we've always had trouble scoring freely like some other teams.
Great Performance by Liverpool with 2 fantastic goals 👏  But still need to work on their defence  ⚽️⚽️
werent that first goal a foul from van dijk no? just tripped a man up before scoring... did that against us (fulham) last game
I thought Trent's bum crack was a bit inappropriate.
Why is nobody speaking abt how much better Sheffield looked last night
liking the dying fly @ 2.49 🤣
And trent doesnt get called up for England....... tough game could have been the usual new manager syndrome but we got through it with a clean sheet.
Wilder has definitely improved defensive marking 😂😂😂
Liverpool one of the Greatest Football clubs in The World guy's 🍾🦉
LiVARpool both goals fouls
Nice goal from SlobbySleigh.
That women commentator called him Von dayke all evening 😂
As an Arsenal fan I just realised we are now 1 and 2. Takes me back to my days as a kid in the late 80s/early 90s.
Not good from Liverpool
Trent is immaculate on every section of the field. Priceless player.
Come on you mighty RedMen ,smash whatever we face ,scouse power ✊️YNWA
What did Trent do
COYR
Idc Trent is the best RB ITW and Debatably OAT
Darwin the great another good performance he never gives up
Come on Liverpool
Listening to the commentator putting on her best manly voice was brilliant
Virgil Von Dake…seriously?!
Bro had a hetpack
I liked my own comment
The woman doesn't know how to say van dijk and Szoboszlai
great work by nunez for second goal
Virgil VON DEYKE played well.
Nunez. ❤😮 Keep doing that!!!
Great save from Kelleher early on. Great improvement from last game. Nunez ever the conundrum.
Ive not heard Vsn Dijk pronounced like that before. Any Dutch speakers know if that is the correct way?
No one talking bout Sheffield GK? Coulda been 5 or 6 w out him
How can Liverpool only win 2-0 against sheff, but can score 4 goals against Fulham 😂
Can’t believe Liverpool fans think trent is the next gerrard, gerrard was a complete player he actually knew how to defend and put a some great tackles in trent only has a long ball in him
I would love us to win it this year. Prove sm ppl wrong.
0:57 - Nice “Ass”ist Trent 😂
Thought I was hallucinating when I saw Wilder in the dugout, when did he come back pmsl
Endo Has to start every game now!
Im pleased queveen did ok.
Why oh why do we have to have female commentators? Hate it!! Have to scroll around the channels to find a proper commentator
Women commentators get on my nerves
A proper proper title race this year
Darwin is Timo Werner 2.0
Sky censoring Trent’s ass 😭😭😭😭😭
Sheffield United made it tough for us but a good 3 points
Von Dake 😂
Szobo finishing is quick and he has a powerful shot in that foot
Keep going Darwin! You’ll soon get there!
well done nunez for chasing that ball back, wish man u had a player like that lol
Another brilliant 3 points !  Funny commentary ..." Von Dake !?"
So glad LFC won did get away with a penalty though Ibou gets carried away sometimes
Trent with the ASSist
Not this commentator again..
What i want to know is how szoboszlais feet move so damn quick? touch.... goal... when did the shot happen?
Get rid female
Swear this bird is always on commentary during Liverpool games?
Great highlights to watch only spoiled by the screeching woman “commentator”. A woman’s high pitched scream when a goal is scored is akin to fingers scratching down a blackboard. They’re blatantly not the best for the job but in these crazy days of diversity they get the job.
Nunez loses the ball and battles back to win it to then assist Sob who’s finishing since arriving has been exceptional, add Trent playing out of his skin right now we about to go on a tear
Man every time Caoimhín plays I’m nervous because all I want is him to thrive, even as no.2, and he does! This experience is invaluable for the lad. Delighted.
Best thing about these comments is that everyone thinks a different guy was outstanding. Shows how many amazing players we have and how they all function so well as a team. Liverpool are amazing and Klopp is still a genius. YNWA
the passion from nunez ❤
Are we gonna ignore how poor Sheffield’s defence was on both goals
Is no one talking about the quality of corners from TAA?? They were like heat seeking missiles.
Quadruple  begins?      Thanks  to   villa  again   too..  no  excuse  simple.
Refereeing decisions going lpools way aplenty since the spurs game  Everton konate red card Mancity disallowed goal Today sheff utd penalty and how has nunez not been penalised for that scissor challenge for the 2nd goal?  LiVARpool are back
Am i the only one who CANNOT STAND that womans voice? Shes trying to sound something she is not.
Female commentator’s voice is so annoying
The display of Trent's assist was brilliant lol
The display of Trent's assist was brilliant lol
Let's be real sheffield should have had a penalty
Another underpar performance but again manage to find a way to scrape a positive result, how wasn’t Souza sent off for his stamp on MacAllister’s leg?
Gomez is always a liability. Keep him as rotation player
The defending for that 2nd goal is beyond embarrassing
Where are you Diaz
Commentators were moving mad against liverpool the whole game. SZO IS A BADMAN
Is Joe Gomez alright 🤔🤔
Harry McGuire will score more goals than Darwin Nunes this season
Martin Tyler back?
First goal probably shouldn’t have stood, second goal definitely shouldn’t have stood, and United deffo shoulda had a pen. They played well tho… even tho Trent’s crack blinded them.
Congratulations Liverpool ❤❤❤
What she saaay? Van what?
That commentary is so forced.  Please stop.
Who's this Von Dayke lad and Soshlie she keeps mentioning?😊
Von dek? This commentator bird is terrible
Still a lot of improvement to happen yet. That is the exciting part.
What horrendous commentary...  "Here comes Darwin Nunez, they're  looking to add a second Liverpool"  "Virgil Von Dake"  Sounded like she had a stroke mid pronouncing Szoboszlai
I cannot understand why Gomez can play for Liverpool
STOPPPP PUTTING A WOMANNNN TO SPEAK ON LIVERPOOLLLLS GAMESS
Virgil - Rolls Royce centre back
Blatant penalty
Naysayers bash Nunez for his missed chances but the guy never lets his head go down. Wins the ball back and lays it on for an good goal. So often compared negatively to Haaland, the king of tantrums. Nunez is a vital part of this Liverpool team which is gradually getting back to their best.
Rubbish commentary
I’m done with Nunez looks like Werner just a waste of a shirt as he not there to graft he’s there to score 😢😢
Hate women commentary
Love Darwin nunez me  Loses it but great tackle to get it back for another assist
I'm not sure the marking could have been any worse for the goals.
Ah we have women commentating
Woman commentator tried to hard to make it exciting. Please leave it to the men.
Sheffield Utds defending for both is horrific. You can't have two players unmarked with that much time at this level
Awful first goal for sheff Utd to concede
It was honestly a pretty lackluster performance from Liverpool, but when we can put in a poor performance and still come away with a 2-0 win I think that says a lot about the quality and mentality of the squad as a whole.
Am I the only one who thinks it looks like Van Dijk steps across and trips a sheffield player on the corner he scored from? Hard to tell from these angles
Highlights don’t show the 4 amazing chances sheff United had then very strange
Why does the woman commentating keep referring to Van Dake?  She is proof diversity hired aren’t a good thing.
Lovely track back
Female commentators ruin it
0:57 That crack😭🔥
Cracking ball in from trent for the first
Brilliant finish from Von Dayke
Why does she say van Dijk that way?
Your going down with the blue shite!
First time van dijk to say a goal from the skipper
liverpool fans saying how they're impressed with a clean sheet, if youre meant to be one of best english teams of all time playing a team which is going to beat derbys record and did concede i think your having big problems
0:57
Trent at the centre of all action. World class.
We are red💪💪💪💪💪
Let’s be real VDV & AA didn’t expose set piece weakness VDV just shoved the Sheff Utd player on the ground so was unmarked
trent the "right back" popping up on the lw
Trent proving why he is world clASS
On recent showing I'd say not title contenders top 4 should be, but defence suspect and up front weaker than before midfield seems to be up to par
Am I the only one that felt like Szo mocking Rashford with that celebration
It's nice they're wearing armbands for the NHS.
Anyone else given up on Nunez?
Why can’t Sheffield Utd play this well in other games. Teams always raise their game against Liverpool.
Trent has to be the most in form player in the league right now. The variety in his passing and shooting is absolutely sublime.
Sheffield’s marking is atrocious
Well deserved clean sheet for Kelleher.
Sheffield utd defence is terrible
First game bk for 1 of our own. Good game we looked a lot better Foderingham did what he use to under wilder n pulled a stunning save. All credit better than the Burnley arsenal and Newcastle losses
The commentator's Dutch pronunciations were doing my head in - who's Von Dake? And when 'Hrayvenbercch' came on late in the game... surprised she got Gakpo right lol (Gakpo is a Ghanaian surname)
Liverpool dominance they should've scored more
Didn't show the push in box that wasn't given a pen and the 2nd goal shouldn't of counted should have been a red for darwin the first goal anel was tripped by van dijk
I hope that’s a one off from Gomez, I’ve been singing his praises lately saying he’s improved so much.
Van dijk back to his best because he scored a goal?
mo salah isnt scoring lol    saving all of them goals for man united 😂
Seeing a lot of LiVARpool fans here so we need a United comment   Feels like a completly different team, we played really well shouldve got more out of the game but our end product wasnt good enough. Brooks needs to start every game if he plays how he did, MOTM preformance   A very good Liverpool team looked very average tonight because of how tight and organsied we were, moments of magic here and there which even got me smiling but very average overall  Come on Blades, we dont mind a loss as long as we play with that much fight and desire ⚔️
They say it takes 18 months to 2 years to get over an injury like VVD had. It's no coincidence he's back to his best now.
The defending on that second goal is unfathomably poor. How can a defence made up of professional footballers leave a man completely unmarked in that manner so close to goal? The mind boggles. I genuinely don't understand.
Van Dijk getting away with a trip on his marker for the first goal. Liverpool the luckiest club in the league. One bad decision then 12 months of PGMOL bending over and lubing for them.
Peppy doesnt look happy 😂😂😂😂😂
Contenders
Both goals after blatant fouls, bizarre refereeing
Liverpool is 2 or 3 great players from winning everything 😩
Trent is just world clASS
Trent 🤣
Thought Martin Tyler retired?🤔
Why aren't sky sports showing Vvd push on Mcatee ?
Absolutely gutted for Matip. His brilliant Liverpool career to end like that is a great shame
Why does she keep calling him Van Dejk?
YNWA ❤️
Although not a great performance tonight, glad we got the 3 points and a clean sheet!  Shame Salah got taken off so early
lol he's really not
Endo looked better tonight. But what an improvement to go from Henderson to Dom 🔥🔥🔥
Emery is the best Villa signing. The guy is the epitome of underrated manager 👏👏👏
Had to watch on mute again. Awful political commentary.
Trent looked like a man on a night out taking that corner. Pull up your shorts 😅
Great ASSist by Trent 😅
I love trent mooning the camera before the first😂
What an ASSist from trent
Sheffield set piece marking makes me feel physically ill
Not being bad, but dislike this commentator. Even the previous 4-3 game
Shouldnt have won that nunez cropped bogle could have broken his leg and van dijk tripped united defender before his goal as well as Konaté shoving mcatee to the ground in the box referee 3 blades nil I’m afraid
Still feel like we are in second gear.
Liverpool are looking good 😎
Hahahahahaha
Trent with a CRACKing delivery
Unbelievable ASSist from Trent!
Sheff utd 😂😂😂😂😂
Seriously Darwin cannot get a goal at close range and one vs one with the keeper. lol
Absolute team of yard dogs, 8 man defence and just want to kick your players for 90 minutes. Got showed a bit of class now get down
Liverpool has too many goal-thirsty players lol
Now to beat Palace Saturday 12 30 kick off big 3 points YNWA first tnt sports YNWA
Liverpool are pretenders. They are getting away with everything not being punished for mistakes. Those things will all come back haunt them
Female commentators totally ruin the atmosphere.
Screamy harpie commentating … and off
0:57 what is trent doing 💀
Say what you like about Darwizzy The Boys got 🔥 in his veins ❤❤❤
Endo was class today
Thank god Nenez passed the ball to Szoboszlai to score rather than the other way around
What’s up with the captains armband 🤨 sick 🤢 of this crap 💩
That ASSist from Trent 😂
Did she say Virgil von Dake????
Any reason Sheffield United didn’t try and pick up anyone in the centre of the box for corners this game??
Who is van dake 🤦🤣🤣
Won’t get much credit but thought Kelleher bounced back really well tonight, very composed and made a couple handy saves
Who is Von Dijk? 🤔😳
Why is it a woman again lol is it was a woman Sunday sort it out sky
Von Dake ..............😂
Trent really did but ass in assist, what a run he’s having atm, either a goal or assist he’s showing his haters he can’t be arsed with their thoughts
Different type of team this season and I love it. This is the actual detention of mentality monsters! And to think we’re in a transitional period 😬❤️
Fantastic
Trent really putting the ASS in assits
No wonder theg have shipped so many goals, cant leave any one alone in the box!
Nunez literally created that 2nd goal from nothing.
Gomez is the complete 🫏
Nunez makes the easy stuff look difficult  But makes the difficult look easy
Sheffield got to be the worst team I’ve witnessed why are Liverpool open in all space’s throughout the game including the first and 2nd goal and other corner kicks
Did VVD not blatantly trip the defender before his goal?
Come on Szobo!😎💪
Szlobachops with the rashford celebration
Szo definitely knows where the back of the net is. Beautiful finish.
scouse cnts
Had to watch it with the volume off
Well Done Virgil... F.A.B. 👍
People aren't talking about Virgil Van Dijks resurgence enough. He's been world class so far this season when so many people were more than happy to write him off as finished based on last season  Not only has he massively bounced back in form, he's doing it at the age of 32 post ACL injury as well. Vidic at the same age had left United by that point. Sol Campbell at the same age was playing for Portsmouth. Kompany left Man City at 33  To bounce back from such a horrible injury like this as club captain as well is incredible
There’s still some CRACKS in this team but we’ll be able to fix it. Great ASSist from Trent for the first goal. Van dijk has been clASS this season and was defo motm
We made an absolute meal out of this game..SMH
Have Sheffield Utd heard of marking?
It's a good time to be alive as a Liverpool fan 😊
Loving the goals from new arrivals Van Dake and Soshlie…
theyre even doing trent dirty in the highlights💀
I love the challenge from Nunez but the more I see these misses I'm sure Jota is ahead Nunez and Gakpo, Jota finds a way to score some how
Van Dijk has been insane this season
Ai ai ai, Liverpool we'll see you in about 2 weeks
Who’s this “Von Dake” that the commentator kept referring too 🤦🏻
Gomez can leave respectfully.
Quadruple  or  double  trophies begins?
Oh for some good commentary
Very frustrating game but expected
Is is just me but is that LFC kit horrid???
1st
Disgraceful foul by Nunez at the end there.
Give that united player an oscar for the dive and roll.
Sssssssh ....but its on !!! YNWA
Gomez at LB was shocking, he does not belong on that side
Captains performance "he's our centre half he's our number 4 watch him defend and we watch him score he'll pass the ball clam as you like he's virgil van dijk he's virgil van dijk" 🔴🔥💯🙌
Quadruple  or double    begins   or finally?
Nice ass I mean assist from Trent
that first goal was a foul. Referee shouldn't have seen it.
Liverpool back to their best again love to see it i have always respected them even though im an Arsenal fan, still wanted them to drop points 😂 but hey good to see Klopp has got them rolling again
Gomez is an accident waiting to happen. The sooner we have Robertson back, the better.
2:43 Dominic WHO? i swear she just said something like shlozai
that sheffield united player should of gotten to prison for that challenge on McAllister.
Joe Gomez has improved.
City loosing where on the beeeeeers
Nunez the playmaker💀💀💀
Shocking defending for both goals
Liverpool are looking very dangerous
Cracking assist from Trent
Not often we’ve seen Liverpool in their purple 3rd kit needs to be given the love & attention it deserves instead of that creeper kit
Another assist for Darwin! Great tackle, great pass. Boss.
The referee in this game was horrendous
The monsters roll on.   Arsenal fans, listen…  Your gonna get a big humbling at Anfield fellas let me tell ye.
I feel like if Klopp goes to a 3-4-3 with a back 3 of Virgil , Konate and Quansah and  Trent pushed into  playing right midfield and Szoboszlai playing Left Midfield with Endo and Mcallister in central. It will give them so much dominance
Nice to see Chris wilder pack in epl he’s a cheerful man who knows his club very well, tough start but he’s the man who can get Sheffield United ticking
Top win reds 🔥👏👏👏
We move. On to Palace 🔴🔴
SzoBOMBlai💣😍🔥🔥
Joel 💔
Gomez when he is CB absolutely diabolical when he is RB he is actually decent ….. time to stick gomez RB and trent into midfield
Not a clASSic but a good win. Trent EXPOSED their set piece weakness with a great ASSist for the first goal. He’s in such great form, shining like a full MOON!
Liverpool might win the Premier League!
1:44 Are they clapping for the goalkeeper? Or are they clapping for Salah’s attempt?
Liverpools starboy doing his idols celebration MR10
Trent is ASStonishing
Vvd and szoboszlai
Fair play to Liverpool for scraping past relegation fodder Sheffield🤣...Still, have PTSD from Kenilworth Road?😭
it’s so funny how the highlights never show how appalling the referee is.
Van Dijk and Szoboszlai well done!❤❤
No match is easy in this league, just ask City.
Female commenter just sounds wrong 😂
incredible ASSist from trent
Put some respect on TAA name.. he is unreal 😅
Fans that still think Gakpo should be starting over Nunez that is what our attack looks like totally void, Nunez did more in 10mins tham Gakpo all game
The bloke commentating couldn’t make it anymore obvious he hates Liverpool 🤣🤣🤣
Tough game but we got the 3 points Endo was brilliant tonight
Same old scousers always cheating
Cheeky assist from Trent 😂
This looked like the Liverpool of old
As a liverpool fan i never want to think about this game again
Wasn't our best game, but we got the 3 points!
Trent easily should of had 3 assists easy tonight unlucky
Von Daek?
You just have to love Darwin Nunez, commitment of a born Scouser.
Women commentators.
WEDNESDAY FAN HERE, NICE ONE JURGEN, TAKE THAT WILDER WAWAW, HAHAHA.
Hat off to Nunez for fighting to get the ball back after losing it first & that led to the second goal!💯❤️⚽️👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
You can see trents ass at 0.57
City beat 😂
Trent is becoming the player he was set out to be
I’m genuinely fearful of what Liverpool can achieve
Darwin with a great assist.  Pure heart.  This guy is a fighter.
Szoboszlai 💣🇭🇺
0:59 was very good what a finish
BREAKING NEWS  Chris Wilder has been sacked by Sheffield United as they are now becoming the new Watford.
Trent whipping out his ass crack as well as corners
Not great performance, but the result matters doing this part of season.
Pointless given the result, but that save from Wes is a contender for best this season.
Why she saying von deyk
Meanwhile C115y have the same number of wins as Manchester United 😂😂😂
Pride armband ? Why ?
Sheffield need to learn to play on. Darwin won that ball back with a great tackle.
Just heard the Matip news 😢he's probably played his last game for us
Good job guys 🙂🙂 1:01 - that finish from captain Virg though
God damn the commentator again is just so painful
That save from saleh was outstanding 😮
what a tackle from Darwin and then a wonderful pass to Szoboszlai
Good win. Feel like we need to play out from the back a lot quicker. Wasn't enough urgency to get the 2nd goal. Anything could've happened the last few minutes.
what an ASSist for trent
I just love how no one is talking about Liverpool's chances of the PL. Everyone are sleeping on Liverpool. I rather there's no mention of Liverpool. We just concentrate on ourselves while everyone moaning about keepers and injuries 😆😆
robbery
Sweet low volley from van dijk
Loved that challenge from Nunez for the second goal tbh
Commentator: Von Deyk
Tearing the blades a new hole
Wish she pronounced the name correctly!
Good result for Liverpool as Man City lose - The title race is getting very interesting.
Cracking corner by trent
2 clear fouls leading to goals…
Who’s “Virgil Von Dake”?
Come on! Captain Van Dijk 💪🏽
That's why we love Darwizzy 😂
trents no no square
Van Dijk looking back to his best.  Man of the Match
