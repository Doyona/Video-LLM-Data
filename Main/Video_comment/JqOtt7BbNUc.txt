The king being able to cut the rope while it's being thrown is really impressive. I don't think many can do it. A rope needs less slack for it to straighten up and get tight. Without it, it is far harder to cut. So yeah, really impressed.
Kings brain got fried lol

Sword art online is a game designed by Akihiko Kayaba for the Nerve Gear, also made by Akihiko Kayaba, which was designed to blow up upon death in-game.

Diddy party
"Once a king reincarnated as a peasant" can be a good anime
sword art online is an anime where people put on headsets without knowing  if you die in the game or take of the headset you die in real life and the only way to take it off is to beat all 10 floors with each one getting harder and the final floor is almost impossible
🧠👂🫨 When hearing your advice about making requests, I have the feeling that is quite daunting and am unsure if I can really do this, because I have a need of being agreeable with people.  One thing I would love you to touch on is how to break down the non violent communication into many sentences and back and forth communication. It feels very unnatural to me to talk in a single sentence about my feelings and my underlying needs. Or to ask a precise request with all the context needed. I would rather break it down and also give the other person opportunity to respond in between.
Famous word  Well see about that
Sword art online traumatized everyone😂
We will see about that😅😅😅
Bro you are crazy😂😂😂
Ain’t no party like a Diddy party…
Bruhh

Peasant's story:  1. I wanted to be a knight, but didn't want to go through all the training, so I tricked the king into saying that he said he'd make me a knight.   2. Even though I was a knight now, the king still insisted on calling me a Peasent.  I was told whoever pulled the sword out of the stone will get to be the next king, so I decided to dig a hole under the stone to try to push it out from the other side assuming it goes all the way through.  It turned out the king was holding onto it and had tied it so it couldn't go up.   3. One day I decided to ask a princess out on a date, but she said she couldn't without her Dad's approval.  Turned out her Dad was the king.  I tricked him into entering the Squid Games by giving him a special card and telling him it would grant him access to billions of dollars in exchange for letting me take his daughter out on a date.  We had a lovely date, but he actually won the games and was furious when he returned.  4. The Grim Reaper came for me and for some reason he still considered me as a peasent too.  I sent him on vacation and gave him a bit of therapy.  5. One day I went to a baker while I was broke, so I told a joke about the king in hopes that he'd trade bread for the humor.  I got arrested for making jokes about the king and received free bread.  6. Some time after getting out of jail, I decided I wanted to quit my job working for the baker, but my companion convinced me to get fired instead, so they still had to pay me for a bit afterwards.  I accidentally caused the fire in the oven to get out of control and got fired for it.  7. Once I bought a fake watch for 5 coins and got the king to try it on.  Then I made a profit selling a fake watch worn by the king.   8. One day I decided I wanted to work as the king, so I murdered somebody and accused to king of being an imposter.  9. I became the next king, so I guess the legend about the sword was true.  The king later proved his innocence and I lost my title.   10. One day I was sent as a messenger to deliver bad news, but then the king made this dumb law that every messenger to deliver bad news would get shot so I pretended I was partially illiterate and the king took it and read it himself giving me plenty of time to escape.   11. Once I saw a group of guys trying to summon the Dark Lord and I wanted to join in the the fun, but they said they were all full on members, so I bought one of their members a ticket to the Titanic.   12. I wanted to go see the world, but the king refused to open the gates or allow anyone to ever leave the kingdom, so I became the princess's boyfriend and got exciled because the king didn't approve. 13. Eventually my excile was revoked and the king sent me to single handedly mentally defeat the dark Knights.  He still calls me Peasent.  I did such by giving them a peptalk. 14. I claimed the last donut one day, but the king took it.  When I said I had dibs, he licked it and then handed it to me to be petty, so I later gave him a donut filled with watermelon seeds. 15. The king refused to give me a Christmas present claiming I wasn't a "good person", so I played him a song and he said I was really good, so he had to give me a present. 16. I decided I wanted to live in the castle, so I convinced the queen to adopt me, so now I'm the king's stepson and the princess's stepbrother.  I guess it wasn't his first marriage.  The king gave me the smallest room in the castle. 17. My stepfather still calls me Peasent.  I guess my name is Prince Peasent now.  Anyways, he sent me to defeat the Barbarians.  I tricked them into believing we were in the middle of a pandemic and they left to avoid illness. I also learned that there is more than one sword that's been stuck in a stone to be pulled out.   18. I wanted to buy some land, but my stepfather, the king refused to give me the money, so I sold somebody's wagon and lied and said it had a portrait of naked royal maids inside.  Also I ran into my biological father who abandoned me after he left to go buy milk. 19. One day I decided I wanted my stepfather's, the king's porcelain pineapple and I stole it. 20. I wanted to reschedule a test I forgot to study for, but the professor said no.  I convinced him to pass me so he wouldn't have me for another semester. 21. My stepfather, the king still calls me Peasent.  He sent me to retrieve the stolen battle plans from a dark knight.  I swapped them with a gift certificate to the spa. 22. My stepfather, the king threw a party that I wasn't invited to, so I gave him a gift that he accidentally paralyzed himself with and snuck into the party.

i never understand how king died and after I randomly found sword art online anime and watch it and re-watch this video i finally understand 💀 (sword art online(sao) for those who don't know it's a deadly game that if a person died in sao they died irl it wasn't like that at start but some evils thing came and explain the rules I don't know much English so I can't explain it properly I'm sorry)
Lol sounds like someone that I did not invite to my birthday party 😂
Nerve gear Me: Oh Sh
youre mom is on the floor
Don't worry kingdom, in 2 years the king might come back
he makes me laugh so much 😂
Even king is tired to have a talk with his people
Can i see your belly dance again? Im died 💀
"Sword art online" only a few people will get it
BRO should ve been in caps
I was watching you since I was five
We'll see about that  King: wey see about tat
Man i like your videos
"I kind of liked it" Me: -deseased-
When the King said, we’ll see about that,  I don’t know why, but I kind of laughed
They jave vacums in the year 1000 like what
One of the funniest short i ever seen
Im gonna go watch sword art online again just because you reminded me it exists
Bro straight up became kirito
I well go to sleep  Mobo:we well see about that💀💀💀
We will se about that
I got 38seconds
Yba music
Now king are the real Sleepy Joe
That guard ...
I have the headset
Guard is gay
peasant: hey Mr King. king: oh no..-
I love your videos
I kind of linked it : >  Us all: BRUH
For those who don't know sword art online is an anime game in vr if u die in the game u die irl
BRO THE KING CUTTED THE ROPE LIKE HE CUTTED A UMBILICAL CORD WITH JUST A MERE SCISSOR 😂😂😂😂
When the king cut the rope so fast I died 😂
SAO , that anime have some years and surprisingly still nothing similar today!!!
Love the SAO reference
Blop
this is the  this is the bookmark tab on my computer
Bro😂
I love how the sao op starts playing and it's nerve gear instead of vr or something like that
Imagine if he repeated and then the video turns out about the king trying to enter HIS party
Guard is my fav character
The guard is always epic😂😂😂
why this is so funny😂😂
The Light's music was a nice touch!
I love how the peasants only disguise is the French guy yet the king still doesn’t remember
Average Bri’ish day:
My guy broke when he mocked him
Bro got SAOed
Bro there is a vr Headset that Cost 2 Billion Dollars and if you try it on you have to play swordt Art online if you die in the Game or remove the Headset youre gonna die in real life
A dustbuster!
Did bro have a oculus BRO ME TOO😲
“We WiLl SeE aBoUt ThAt“ got me hard 😂
Bro making the King more likeable is gold.
Some day he will say "We'll see about that" and get a "That's what she said" from the king
These guys videos are so funny😂
the king just suddenly pulls out a hairdryer
Yea the king was stuck on SAO
I love these videos
NERVEGEAR. HELL YEAH!
But did he survive Sword Art Online is the true question
Can we get some merch that says   We’ll see about that
I see u put a naruto song in the vid
Your videos always making me laugh. You’re so funny.
this guy is the funniest youtube shorts maker
"Hey Mr. King?" "Oh no..." got me dead 💀💀💀
Man mocked himself
I am mobo might be the most successful YouTube shorts poster, he gets at least 10m views each video
😂
For those who don’t know Sword Art Online is a anime where people get stuck in a VR game that’s impossible to get out of. (Unless you have MC Plot Armor. Also by dieing in this VR game you’ll die in the real world too.)
*can is you belly dance again *😂had me cracking up
I love the modern technology
That crossing field was banger keep it up
1865
Sword art online joke 😢 😂
Its so funny that i saw this sword art online reference when i'm finishing sword art online.
Yes
just when i started watching sao LMAO
SWORD ART ONLINE ON TOP
The king ones are my favorite ones
SWORD ART ONLINE BABY
Well bc of that u will probably die yayyyyy🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 LOL XD😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I think u technically murdered the king lol 😂😂😂😂😂
I loved the sao reference
You know the king has genius iq when he pulls out the vacuum
King causally dies  Gaurd : can i see ur belly dance a gain
“No I don’t want to dance bro” 💀
Such a good anime thought
Attack on
The fact that I just finished watching the first season of Sword Art Online
Bro thought he listened to the peasant 💀
I get so exited that something grows in my pants
Legends says he was one of the top swords man in sword art online but never came back and gone to gun gale online ☠️☠️☠️
The king id commander heathcliff
SAO anime watchers     👇
O
Crossing fields brings back memories 😭
The guard 😂
I love sao
Bro better be ready to die in SAO, unless he got plot armor or something
1.8m likes but 3.3k comments...
The king forgot to say "link start"
Nice
“We’ll see about that” “wE’lL sEe AbOuT tHaT”  Had me dying
When they said Sword Art Online its an anime its worled cuz wjen you get into game you cant quit until u beat game and if someone force to get out vr it burns ur brain
Bro do a qna please🙏🙏
Can you do a speedrun but he fails
"i kinda liked it" 💀
w
Finally, a reference to a mid show I like
Sword art online will give him a surprise later
„ooo sword art online” this line makes me roll from laughter averytime I watch this💀
For who dont know sowrd art online is an anime and is a vr game amd if u play that game u can quit and if u want to quit you mist deafeat the lvl 100 boss and if u died u died in real life on in anime*
WELL HE DID WARN THE KING
*throws egg bomb*
his videos is funny and still becoming more funny
at this point the king is just used to it 💀
I love SAO
For those who dont know nerve gear is a real life thing that some guy was making and if you die in game you will die in real life
Omg he used sword are online refrence its a favorite anime of mine if you dknt get the reference ill wxplain in the show a new gear went around basically like vr but hella more advaned and millions of people couldentlog out for years so they were trapped and had to kill monsters andif they died in the gamethey died in real life
Pls do if eric cartman from south park is indian
😅😂
WHY DOES THE GUARD LOOK LIKE THAT IN THE LAST PIC IM DYING
For those who don’t get it, in Sword Art Online the main character gets trapped in a vr game and the whole anime is based around beating the game to try and get out.
this was the last video i wanted to watch before i go on my vr lol
vr?
I'll do it instead
"Oo Sword Art Online" 💀
I like sword art online so I liked
The King's mocking of him was just absolutely hilarious 😂😂
The king now know this guys behaviour
Ok we’ll see about tha.. king: we will see about that
what is up with the peasant?
Why do I have so many likes 💀💀💀
No not sword art online!
What did that one guard say...... wait
😂😂😂
King's we'll see about that. Was so damn cute😂😂😂
Bro's about to become the next kirito
i wanna see that belly dance again
Peasant: *throws rope* King: *cuts it with scissors*
Have fun defeating Akahibo Kaaba
How has this king not banished him yet, then again he’d just say “we’ll see about that” and speed run getting back in
Sao option the best ending
I hate I mean like SAO
After this u can see the king in 1st ep of sword art online
Did he survive sao?
Bro's stealth isn't high enough.
If you're saying "oh no, not again" just say yes at that point
What is Sword Art Online...
I LOVE SAO!
Man, just leave the king alone 😭
HI IM SUCH A FAN
Your shorts are the only single YouTube shorts that I watch till the end, love them! 😂
XD THAT MOCK
I always get a feeling that the guard likes the peasant
Poor king 😢 not even in his party
Broo ur the best😂😆😆
'hey mr king'
The gaurd is sus🙁☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
He literally just includes things which I love... Naruto? SAO?? Giornos theme? He's got it all covered
I think the king's guard in this episode is gay lol
I loved Sword Art Online
Welcome to the “he is so humble zone”
Ah, you see. The beginning is humorous because vacuum cleaners were not invented at that time, therefore it is impossible for him to vacuum the smoke produced by the smoke bomb
The king should say yes sometime, maybe it'd be reverse psychology
Guys, i've decided. He must make a TV show about this.
I demand to play gorilla tag with you now
this video is now iconix
not the Sao
God loves you guys!
You are the best YouTuber ever I swear
What’s sword art online????

🗿
THE GUARD IS SO GOOD
ℍ𝕒𝕚
The headset that kills you
“One no” 😂
I just hope one day Peasant will give the guard an honest chance for a date
Xddd
Good sao part
The Bly dance lmao
The reason why the king died when he touched sth in the 3 way it's because that sth made him die and that's the vr headset that can kill you when you die in the game so you die in real life and the vr has 3 horns if you die in game they will explode leading you to death
Awesome 😂😂😂😂😂😂
this is one heck of a SAO reference
Wow you held so many world record's
I kinda wanna see the king say “we’ll see about that” In one it could be funny
Hey can I see that Sao again GIVE ME THAT VR
Feel bad for any one not getting sword art online 😂
King went to SAO 🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂😂😂
Fuck the guard to get close to the king
I love the evolution of "we'll see about that" Everyone in his town is sick of his shit
SAO fans 👇

All good videos I love you so
A sisrr

Love the SAO reference
I’m just imagining the lyrics  Shake ya body like a belly dancer
only you can use these anime references in this way 😆
OMG THATS REALLY FUNNY IMA SUB RIGHT NOW
Btw sword art online is a game if you die in the game the headset explodes or maybe I’m talking about a different game
Bro when into the SAO universe he wont be back for awhile 😂
HEY I WANT THAT  GIMME THE DAM NERVE GEAR
I think that specific knight is gay
let’s just all take a moment to appreciate the time and the sacrifice that the egg did just to appear in a video truly sad😢
For the people who doesnt understand the part with the 'sword art online': Sword art online(sao) is an Anime where people can go from reality to the game. In the first season of Sao was everyone who played it captured and would be able to come out untill they play to the end. If you would have died in the game you would have died in reality. And while they were in the game they didn't were able to move their bodys in rl
💀
This man is a god in the ways of comedy
the king:well see about that
“I kind of liked it”
I love it
I luv this dude
Ayoooo
Him: “We’ll see about that” King: “UNO REVERSE 😎”
Bro predicted the oculus headset that kills
yeah SAO lol that was awesome
Just Wana say you look so much like merlin from the show
bro predicted the future with the vr thing
And now sword art online is real with that new headset
They got tired about your "let's see about that" because they're literally the same person
That OST Kinda made me wanna rewatch Sao fr
Bro I love his videos it’s epic
hey can you give my comment a like MOBO: no me: wil- MOBO: will see about that
BoB
PALMER LUCKEY HAS JOINED THE CHAT

All I got started watching anime before it became mainstream and I was called a dork a loser and a nerd in high school I was also kicked in the nuts and told I would never be anything because I watch anime meanwhile the pandemic happens and everyone watches anime now mostly f****** Everyone's an anime fan and I just imagine those ass whoopings in high school although to be fair my friend did help me whoop some ass however I will admit that while I could take a meeting from anyone in the world and get up walking away or at the very least crawling away my man would drop all his defenses to kill someone with his punches so me and him were the Perfect combo team I'd let anyone hit me it didn't matter their age I was in the fifth grade and I got my ass whooped by a 12th grader and still managed to hold my ground standing there letting that 12th grader beat the hell out of me Meanwhile my friend comes around and knocks him two times it's 12th grader he's around and did not get it back up this is why I say my fat is my best Shield
only the elite understand
HAHAHA sword art online the best anime i ever watch

Peasant: “we’ll see about tha-“ King: “We’Ll SeE aBoUt ThAt”  Peasant: and I took that personally

The sword art Online thing makes sense
I was just watching sword art online
“We’ll see about that” speedrun?
Did u just say sword art online it's a anime and guys go watch it
This guy makes my day
Man just disrespected sao In two sentences
I feel bad for the king having to be in sword art online he is absolutely fucked
Everyone in that kingdom are tired of his shit by now !
Rip the King he in sword art now, he's done

“Hey king can i come to your party?” “No” “Okay” *walks away* king: “Hold up”
The guard is down bad

Ah sao I see you are a man of culture I to like that anime
Hey I remember that guy
X'D What the frack?!?  Also why not just let him if his gonna find a way to do it
THE BEST ANIME FROM 2012 SWORD ART ONLINE LETS GO
Once i heard NerveGear I'm all to the moon ngl xD
Hi
Rip king
King exactly my bros when they do something unfair cos I did something they didn't like
Right as i hear nerve gear i already imagined the king getting killed at the first level of sao
SAO 💀 YESSSSSS
That’s why the name Nervegear sounded so familiar😅
Lol sao got me shocked
when he looked at the king like “this mf really mocked me” it made me laugh 😂
Snea king into a party
You know what there's one part of this joke that upsets me and that's that the nerve gear would shut down his entire like brain and whatnot prevent him from moving not sword art online specifically so the peasant should have warned him not to put it on unless he's like in bed or ready to die
For those who dont know about Sword Art Online: Its an anime where the players got trapped in a game. If the players tried to unplug their headsets, they would automatically die in real life. The only way to escape was not to get killed in the game and complete its stages.
If you look at #2 you can see the time traveller scientist from the time travel series
We'll see abaut that made me die💀💀💀
is this Ian boggs
The king died The guard in his mind : "il see about that" Also the guard : can I see your belly dance 💀
The king:“Ooo Sword Art Online” Me:Thats right
one of the best creators out there so funny
i think he was not survive i my game
Guys sword art online is a anime where people are stuck in the game until they complete the last floor on the boss Tower
0:00
Peasant: "I perform for tonight." King: "Oh. So you are the belly            dancer?" Peasant: "Huh?" King: "Can I see a little preview of the               show?" Peasant: "I don't want to ruin the.                      surprise for tonight." King: "DO IT!" Peasant: Does the belly dance. Peasant: "Yeah. It's not worth it." King: "I knew it." Knight: "I kinda like it".

Can't believe he used a sword art online reference like that is my favorite show.

What's sword art online? Pls tell me it's a medieval pvp sword fight game
At this point the king has caught on to his game
I hope he met kirito and friends 😂
Wait wat
Easiest way to sneak into party for solution:  Me: *walls as to nightclubs that requires 21 years old to entrance* "Hey sir, can I go in the party?"  Security Guards: "No, you can't!"  Me: "Why not?"  Security Guards: "Because, it requires anyone to enter with ID required at 21 years and over!"   Me: "Here's my ID!" *gives fake ID to Security Guards that looks like realistic driver licenses*  Security Guards: *checks his ID* "Ok, now you enter!"  Me: "YAY!" *rushed to the entrance!"  Security Guards: "Actually, This definitely not an real ID, I see looks like says that Made in China!"  Me: "Bruh... WHAT!?" *got kicked out from floors into skies due to fake ids*

Only legend use "Well see about that" when something dont go according to their plan
The guards are the best 👌
The first part when the king repeats Him both of the parts in which the Knight says for the belly dance
what soundtrack was that when the king wear the  nerve gear? was it the sword art online?
Me:watch it 5 times and stop laughing  Peasant:it's not worth King:I knew it Knight:I kinda liked it Knight:can I see ur belly dance again Me laughing in pain
This Guy videos all ways makes me laugh 😂
What is sword art online I get its an anime but I don't get why he's like don't touch that
"Hey hey FREEZE Water you doing? You're under a vest"
Say that one line that literally shoved a sword called “laughter”
Eyyyyy that knight sounding' sus
The fact that the king shows up in future shorts means that he got through all 100 floors...
Pfjhhhh
Opening starts but you forgot pvp is on
Welp, the King better beat Akihiko Kayaba or the 100th floor cuz otherwise, he's a goner...
I love how the king literally has everything to ruin his trick 😂
The guard is a legend for remembering what he did before
When he pulled out the oculus i was putting stickers on mine 😳

accept Jesus as your Lord and savior and your life will be better do it if you want too i aint forcing you tho live yall ...,,,,
My favorite anime sao
MoBo : We'll see bout that- King : We'll see bout that (in a annoying accent) Mobo : What the fu-
What is wrong with those guards?
Knight:I kinda liked it Me POV:GAYYYYYY ASSSSS ALLLLLL HELLLLL
If I find the king playing SAO I am unplugging the Nerve Gear helmet
The belly dance 🤣

True speedrun strat would be jumping several times while spinning around wildly in a corner, until he gets yeeted into the party room.
Let's make one guy gay and make him be weird and say he's a creep. Stupid. Let's be homophobic and promote the old idea that gay people are predators. Get outta here 🙄 gross. At least I know you're a homophobe so I can avoid you.
I hate these videos
I love when the song starts playing
Like the SAO reference
Lol the sword art online part was unexpected
The sussy knight tho 👀😫💓
when SAO is a way to kill people without a trace
The sword art online one was my favorite

I bet he'd die to a boar
(I have done these sins, and I’m still doing sins like idolatry, sexual immorality, and cursing. I need to work on this stuff. This proves I’m not perfect.) I want to ask you a question. Do you think your a good person, if so why? I’ll ask these questions. So, have you ever stolen, lied, thought sexually about a man, or a woman (you commit adultery in your heart), had sex outside of marriage, cursed, watched porn, acted on homosexuality, spending to much time on your phone,  using God’s name in vain (saying omg), witchcraft, or hating others (murder in your heart)? According to the Bible, we’ve done this thing called sin. What is sin? Sin is disobedience to God’s Perfect Law. And we’ve all disobeyed it. And our punishment is spiritual death, and an eternity away from God (Hell). And we deserve to go to Hell. Hell is a place where you’ll remember all the bad things you’ve done, and you’ll regret it. Hell is a fiery furnace that’ll never stop burning. The fire will NEVER be quenched to those who are there. They’re there forever. Hell is a place with no love. And God is love. There is no light in Hell. And God is Light. That describes Hell, and some people reading this is going to Hell now. But I’ve come to tell you the Good News that might turn you to repentance. Jesus Christ (Christ means: The Anointed One, not a last name), the Messiah, came down from Heaven, to Earth, to save us from our sins! He was mocked, rejected, persecuted… And He still died for us. He even gives you air in your lungs. Jesus died for you, on the cross, and three days later, rose from the dead! So that He might save you from your sins. We deserve Hell, but Jesus took it for us. Because of Jesus’s death, and resurrection, we can go to Heaven, and not be eternally doomed! But it’s your choice to repent. What is repentance? It is turning away from your sins, and turning to God! So, I ask you. Turn to Him, ask Him for forgiveness for rebellion against Him, and also ask Him to save you from Hell.  Also, don’t use Jesus as your escape ticket from Hell. It’s your choice. Repent Or Perish. What will you choose?
Sword art online ;-;  I didn't know what to put, but yeah...       I guess I'm Asuna now :]

*A M O G U S !*
He gave the king a quest 2 and he called it a nerve gear
**casual giddy sao fan noises**  Ps. I dispise the second part of season one, more specifically the fairy dance arc

Dang that season 1song tho I miss sao
This guy's content is so addicting bruh

I like how when the king puts on the VR and died and the gaurd said can I see your belly dance again

Me who watch SAO and know what nerve gear is lol
They should make another season of sword art online
Sword art online fans me to lol
I like all his videos I watched ten times
“Your daughter has me as her plus one!”
Why did I fangirl so ducking hard when I heard the SAO music-
heheheh
Why are you restarting the timer evry time
I watch sword art online
“Can I see your belly dance again?” *T-Poses because my gay senses are going off*
For people who don't know what nerve gear is: Basically there was this anime where this VR that gets connected to your brain and have you inside an mmo like, you get stimulated to think you're feeling every surface and tasting, smelling and even feeling temperature but in your brain and it's basically like you're watching a vivid dream...now suddenly the creator pulls a move of "you stuck here and if you die here you die irl, and if someone tries to disconnect you you die too, good luck beating a tour of monsters cause that's how you get out" after a whole season that people love and others detest they're faced with the creator, they ask him why he did that and he goes "idk lol bye" and leave. The name of the anime is sword art online and it's responsible for making the isekai genre (loser irk gets transported to a Japanese elder scrolls except people aren't ugly and don't hate his guts)
Did he-
The king is about to come out lookin SKINNY
Damn i like that reference xD
For the love of God can someone tell me what the name of the song that plays when he finds a new strategy

Trade Sanctions “We do not want to attack China on sensitive issues like organ harvesting, but I really think we should, because organ harvesting is really a very blunt attack on basic human rights,” van Dalen explained. “It’s too much talking about trade, about money, and not enough about human rights and the rights of minorities.”  After being accused of committing genocide in its treatment of the Uyghurs, the CCP imposed retaliatory sanctions against European politicians. The EU responded by suspending its investment plan with China.   van Dalen welcomes this decision and hopes that such initiatives continue until the CCP stops its human rights violations. “We should use this as a whip stick to make clear to China that the violation of human rights is important,” he said. In fact, known CCP violations are not just limited to forced organ harvesting; rather, they involve a wide range of human rights abuses.   van Dalen warned EU countries to pay attention to what is going on in China. He emphasized that business people or medical professionals should be alert to the situation in China, especially the forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience. In the meantime, he has been working hard to bring this topic back to the European Parliament’s agenda.   Annick Ponthier, Member of Parliament (MP) from Belgium, attended the forum. In an interview, she said that such a message needs to be passed to the politician circle and that she would work on this alongside her colleagues. MP Ponthier believes that forced organ harvesting in China is also an important issue for Europe and that human rights should be safeguarded across political venues.

PERFECT AS ALWAYS
那时候我是银行大堂经理，感觉前途渺茫，也算大龄剩女，心里很孤单，每天都要鼓励自己用积极的心态面对生活。有天快下班了，一个阿姨很着急地过来说被诈骗了，我看了她的手机支付短信，知道她弄错了。想起自己妈妈岁数大，也经常有搞不清楚的状况，所以就挺耐心地多给她解释了一会儿。那个阿姨也爱说话，我一直陪她说到下班关门，后来她要走了我的电话号码。  再后来，我通过她的介绍，认识了我老公。  二  说说我做坏事的恶报吧。  那天去给手机换电池，觉得对方换得不好，得理不饶人地说了对方好久，过后自己都觉得自己有点过分。  第二天骑车出去，手机从包里漏出去了，同时漏出去的还有手机充电宝。当时大约骑过去两三百米了，一个人从后面叫住我说：你丢东西了。低头一看，才发现自己的包口放倒了，一摸，手机不见了。就掉头回去找，找到第一个路口，刚好看见有人俯身捡起我的充电宝，就跟对方说：是我掉的，对方马上还给我了。但手机就再也找不到了。  三  这么温暖，我也来贡献一个微不足道的故事吧～  有次坐车回学校，下车的时候突然开始下暴雨，我带了伞，看到一个姑娘挺着急的样子，就问她要不要一块走。她说急着要去教学楼开会，但是我当时是要回宿舍。看她那么急，我也不太忙，于是就一路把她送到教学楼了。  当时还以为她是个学生，后来我申请交换的时候又见到她了，才知道她是负责这一块的老师。结果可想而知啦～办事特别顺利，好多材料的准备，还有面试的注意事项，都给我讲的一清二楚～  真的是那句话，勿以善小而不为，举手之劳么。
I love your videos!

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!

However, if you don't send this to at least 10 people by the stroke of midnight tonight you will be forever cursed in love. Just copy and paste this.. Good Luck!

#CreepPov👀
"We will see about that" If you don't subscribe to Mobo😂
Yo this dude makes godly vids make me laugh every time duh
Finally, one of the characters mock his line. Heh heh.  And it seems to have Some mythical meaning and only meant for the MC because YO SHIT HE DEAD!! And that gay guard, lol! This deserves a book, manga or an anime.
As soon as I heared the SAO music I was like oh heck yeah I’m in love with this channel
"Jesus Return" I had a dream about Jesus's return, I was in my bed and I was praying. After my prayer, a bright light came brighter than the sun itself it shined like diamonds, and stars with it came forth a being with bronze and gold amour bringing a sense of peace and love holding a flaming sword and within the sword a burning heat came from it. And the person being Jesus grabbed me by the arm and lifted me from my room I was in the sky, and there saw monstrous beings that were gray and tall they were taking those who chose the world over Jesus and as revelation proceeded I was at a balcony talking to an angel, I watched what was happening to those left behind. The angel said, "All the people knew about his return but did not care that he is the Son of God, all they had to do was believe in him and they would have been saved."
LINK SUTAATO!! I hope he will enjoying his new live in Aincrad

Knight when king is gone:can I see your belly dance again 😂😂😂😂😂😂
sus knight: "I kinda like it"
is the king the guard why is he always outside standing there someone kicked him
Can you make more video
"Can i see your belly dance again ?"
We will see about tha- King:We will see about that
Did not expect the SAO reference but dam I missed that. Thank you for making me remember it.
You'd think this format would get old but I could watch these videos for the rest of my life. Then the rest of the afterlife. Then I get reincarnate but I still keep watching these videos. Then maybe I die again, but don't worry, because my ghost is still watching.
I very like the song strategy its very satisfying and sorry i am late
He is so dead
I kinda miss his gameplay
The guard is creepy af
MoBo: OK well see about tha- King: OK well see about that  MoBo: You dare mock me
I like how he got instantly killed in SAO
XD how funny it was when he said "well see about that" in a baby voice LMAO 🤣😂
#CreepyPov for the poor men
"Can I see your belly dance again"
The sao part was such a twist xD
Peasant: we'll see about that King: "we'll see about that"  I guess the king also watch your shorts A huge step to be a very popular channel

I've always wondered if they passed out while in SAO or if they were sleeping bc their conciousness is now in a game
Oh so that's Kiritos true origin story
I got here before he could say we'll see about that
Early before it gets to trending number one Daddy
This guy is so underrated
He was like oh no I don’t want to dance
No I don’t want to dance bro ☠️☠️
he got him a quest 2, nice
I love that
Guard is the #1 simp😶
Hey if you don't mind I also have the quest 2 and I was wondering if we could play together or you could add me? Only if you want to though.
I was convinced that the thing that the peasant dropped to the floor was a Gabia egg from scissor seven.
https://youtube.com/shorts/ID9XYLz1KuM?feature=share
Hmm, so I can say to president that I want to be president And if he days no, all I need to do is say "We will see About that"

“Can I see your belly dance again?”  I died 💀
You should do it where he says I will tell your wife your cheating. And then the kings like how did you know, and then you say I didn’t or something
‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎E‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎

"can I see your belly dance again?"

Plot twist: the king is the spiky haried guy in the show at the beginning (aka Kibaou)  Edit: realized his name is Kibaou
Early! I love your videos 🥰
The king mockingly saying "we'll see about that" is everything
ok
"I kinda liked it" "Can i see your belly dance again?"
I’m becoming increasingly worried of what the power of “we’ll see about that” can *actually accomplish*
