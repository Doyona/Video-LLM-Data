Whose calling for Klopp to be sacked now
Adrian you were right about the score 2 nill, but you forgot about the 5 fooking goals Madrid scored, time to shut up and retire you nob ed
2 Seasons out 8 seasons we looked invincible , the past 6 seasons  we look worse than Souness Hodgson Rodgers teams  37 new players brought in the cost of £749,634,000  and only 1 premier league title is that a god status what most Liverpool fans have put Klopp on a pedestal
Get out Klopp from Liverpool..new coach we need
You get sha* on if you say Klopp out. In my opinion he’s got to go. He’s only won one prem title in 7 years. One CL title out of 3 finals. So we’re celebrating second place mentality now?? He’s had his chances and I knew we would get worse. Blame fsg all you want but how do our world class players play amazingly and suddenly in the new season they play poorly. We needed new mid fielders above any other position but guess what, klopp chooses a striker and another winger.
Spot on Craig, Klopps enain grin annoys me, they don't play fast enough. What on earth has happened to the pressing? They lack fight & desire that's not good enough Klopp is responsible I expect much better than this.
Play Matt Phillips at centre back and your problems will change
Liverpool are back baby 😂😂😂 mind the gap GGMU ❤
Players are getting paid to much for just turning up happening all over the top teams of the league we need a change in pay for the players!! Pay on performance!!!! For the sake of the game!!!! The millennial generation of players! Are now showing there lazy ass attitude!!! Change the way they think about the game and start paying them for their actions and input into the game!! You play like sh!t you get paid for sh!t!! Since Covid everyone has got so lazy not just in football but the whole world! Nothing is working specially in the uk!!!
"klopp has lost it."  You're a disgrace mate.
Oxlade & Elliot are not Liverpool. We need about 4 players of quality right now,  for God's sake, we are beginning to look like Everton, that's no joke by the way, that's just a fact. Mo Salah didn't get a look in, why?. The thing is, we have nobody to come off the bench 😒.
Get it up ye! You all slagged us off at the start of the season when Brentford beat us! Now we are one point off City and sitting in 4th😂 GGMU ❤ Thursday night football is calling you.
This man has the perfect face for radio
Love your  passion  Craig, thats how  we should  all be.....
As a non-Liverpool fan I really appreciate this fair and sensible assessment. Fair play to you.
My guess is that there is a feeling of imbalance and uncertainty in the squad. We have players on their way out , players who don’t know wether they’re in or out , there’s new players looking for stability and there’s a handful of here for the long term. Klopp needs to get the team in on what’s happening , that’s if he knows what’s happening….. A set of players who all know where their place is with no dead wood.
The defenders have getting  exposed badly there's no midfield Roberson and Arnold and Chamberlain are  crap they play all the time we keep losing good players have a ploblem playing with players who should not be in Liverpool and FA is to blame for there fucking rule about home born players
Mufc
I know it isn't fifa but why isn't trent being played as a winger? I'm not a Liverpool fan so I don't follow too much so I'm probably ignorant, but why is it seemingly insistent he plays as a rb?
Go on Craig, let it rip!!!!!
The effort level, the willingness to put their body on the line, the hunger - all not there. The players play like they're entitled to the win
Klopp has become a laughingstock because of his Pride.
there pure shit now i could not show my face in public with the money there on so baddddddd
Bajcetic is best all round midfielder we got. Fact.
FSG and Klopp to blame no true midfielder signings for over 4 years. No wonder they selling club.
Let’s sack klopp and replace him with Moyes or get ole at the wheel! 💀
Support your local pal.
One man team you are Liverpool since Mane left you been very very poor 🙄😳😕🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔😅😅🤣
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Craig, keep in control of your composure & professionalism. The coaching team choose the players based on their performance in training. It is the players responsibility to prepare themselves mentally & physically to perform in the game. If they don’t the coaching team have to make substitutions to correct the players lack of game performance. I agree Liverpool players have aged in an era of their success like most if not all teams. If the TEAM OWNERS don’t want to spend THEIR MONEY, what can the manager do until the TEAM OWNERS do spend, until then the coaching team play who they have & show up in training & in the game. Thanks for your consistency.
I can't believe klopp said all the bunch of lies in the press , we have conceded almost as worse as the relegation teams, and klopp is like , moment we did good , we could have , we had to throw everything and left open... Duck , nonsense, if this is what he is seeing then i am seriously worried if he has lost the plot ... What he hell did we train in Dubai for , what the hell did pep Lin say something like we trained in positional play and stuff , horse shit.
Back to life back to reality
You can clearly see the players has no interest in playing ball.
I agree Klopp is becoming clueless.
You should bring on husam on the channel to have a conversation
Luis diaz come back please 🙏 😢
I think there is a few ways to solve our problems 1. New Owners that invest in 3 new midfielders, a world class striker, new medical staff , new recruitment team that concentrate on buying the best under 17 year olds and start producing quality future first team players that can be loaned out for development. Support Klopp in the transfer market with a open transfer package. 2. If no new Owners , Klopp keeps turning water into wine , maybe clear out , Thiago , Keita , Henderson , Elliot , get rid of every small midfielder and buy physical bully’s like Gini types , hit the itialian league and German league for Klopp pressing players , maybe tear the whole team up and start new is the only solution if we have FSG mindset of Moneyball ownership, Klopp has an impossible job under these owners , needs to work miracles.
Hi Craig thanks so much for speaking the fucking truth it make my blood fucking boil not happy no at all sell the lot off them
LiVARpool must be poor can't pay the officials anymore 🤣
Nice video
Up brentford 😂😂
Loserpool 🤣🤣🤣
Klopp is a massive problem, one day it will start to click with the fans.
darwin carrol
1 midfielder brought in 4 and a half years is disgusting and now we are paying for it how do you buy one midfielder in 4 and a half years a club the size of Liverpool is disgusting
Klopp OUT!!
Gakpo must be looking for a shrink after signing for a team that played so Kak.
Craig, theres no arguing the toss. We played Kak and Klopp is experimenting at our expense.
TAA refusal to get to the goal line and whip in a cross is the most frustrating thing to watch.
That first half performance was insipid. So many of our players aren't what they once were
When you're depending on the likes of Jones you know your in big trouble.. How the likes of ox and Jones are in this team I'll never know..
Is Harvey good enough? 19 years old he needs to be an OUTSTANDING player to start in our first 11 and that he ain’t. Thiago is neither good enough it right for us. Fabhino follows the ball around like a puppy. Ox and keita are a waste of 90m Virgil hasn’t been the same since T. rex Pickford tried to murder him and Trent is not a right back. That team has been left to rot since winning the champions league instead of building when successful we wait until it’s too late and no one of any repute would sign for us.
One thing that’s really bothered me this season is klopp being so stubborn to play one style when we don’t have the personal to do it anymore. The midfield used to be in the peak of their powers as an engine room with gini Hendo and Fabinho. Gini is gone. Hendo is older. and Fabinho has been majority average/awful this season. Yet klopp persists with the same formation and style. Their was a couple games this season some prem some champs were we changed the style, formation and we got good results against good teams (most notably city). Lastly in most games that we’ve got cooked this season has been with elliot playing in the RCM in the 433. It started with Napoli away. Klopp and ljinders have been very slow to adapt this season. All we can hope for this season is top 4 and maybe FA cup run. P.S don’t get me started on Nunez or I’ll write 3 paragraphs in this comment. All I’ll say is I am getting major Werner vibes.
Nah I can't watch this anymore
Why is nobody calling out salah?? Dug his heels in for a new contract he’s on £400,000 a week and he is garbage has been since last Christmas piss poor and he deserves criticism as much as the rest 😡
Can’t you guys see that Kloppie is finished! He can’t keep up with the best coach in the world.  Replace him now before you start dropping to 12th-15th.
I can’t wait till hear the Propaganda of Arthur Melo fully fit is like a new signing. The arrogance of this club is worrying we think we are gods gift and players will drop their knees for us when other clubs have money
Remember the Gini hate? The Brilliance of Fabinho & Gini combination was our best engine we could actually defend in the middle and hit them with pace. We rely on pace yet our finishing is horrendous. Nunez being the scapegoat as usual I hope he comes good but not looking good
Man so many things to say… Terrible. Big up craig YNWA brother bloody hell, we needed that win too 🤦‍♂️
As usual, right on.
Exactly!!!
agree bro..klopp must take all reasonablity for this lost..why cavalho just sit on the bench..1 word i said klopp was stupid 😫
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ox, Elliott, jones and tsimikas are championship level tbh. With those kinda players you cant win the League. We need experienced players and i cant defend darwin anymore.
Well done Loserpool 😂
Am shocked speechless at our poor performance and Klopp's lackluster choices for subs.  Why in hell doesn't Carvalho get a chance to show his talent!!  Unless chances in midfield are made quickly, forget about a top four spot.
Klopp needs to grow a pair and demand investment, at this point the whole world see this but he is just being a jackass and putting faith on a bunch of players that have passed their prime   He needs to go demand changes
Lol too much crying without talking to the point
Klopp admitted we need a midfielder and he still didn't buy one
100% agree totally.
Klopp has very little tactical ability. He doesn't change things because he doesn't know how to. When his way stops working he gets found out. His time at Liverpool is over. Bring in Tuchel
Worst part about this is how most of us weren't surprised with the result. That's the most worrying thing
Ppl using nunez as scapegoat yes he missed couple of crucial chances but what about other attackers no attacking threat & abysmal defending performance!? Brentford had few possession yet their hunger & vision for scoring goals is so good than compares to us...
Discusting performance
I was wishing Brantford win I didn't think it would happen and I am man utd fan thank you for the chance to go 7 pts clear in top 4
NabyLad was good today.
one word OWNED !
Klopp saying that third goal should of been ruled out🤣🤣🤣🤣 he's crazy the guy was like paper 🤯
No Bellingham,please an over priced and over hyped England player.we need a hard working had tackling midfielder
Teams now know how to play against us, Klopp needs to get a real RB and change his style of play
Yeah agree with the comments I've read. You're calling it like most of us saw it! Spot on criticism that we've brought on ourselves as a club. Really seeing klopp's weakness's as a manager now..and it's really irritating. Smh.
As much as you Liverpool fans will deny it there’s no way you lot actually think Darwin is a good player, he’s sooo bad 😂
I cant wait for Real Madrid to smack this sorry ass team 😂😂
I agree with you, just sell jones, ox to get a new mildfielder.
Thiago has been a bit of a flop to me.. Keita is rubbish… Elliot has dipped and fabinho has no legs anymore… we need 3 new midfielders💁‍♂️
What concerns me most is how leggy & tired the players look. Absolutely bereft of energy .   Considerimg that most of these had been resting during the WC I'm stupefied as to why they're so tired. WTF is going on in training? Seriously WTF?
Thank God Craig isn't deluded and pretends like it's fine. It isn't. This performance was disgraceful and an embarrassment to us. Full respect to Brentford, you lads were brilliant. Should've had more, no problems with saying that. Konate and Van Dijk were a shambolic mess. Nunez can't shoot for his life. Mo was invisible. Apart from the goal, Oxlade Chamberlain was horrible. Tsimikas was like a confused child. Trent can't defend when he's pressured by anyone without someone helping him. Midfield were acting like it was a meaningless training match. Simply pathetic. Klopp is the gaffer, he is a footballing genius.  But Fabio has been treated horribly. We need more players. Especially a midfielder. Sell Ox and Jones and get someone who actually has a willingness to fight. No more of these excuses, thinking that we don't notice all these problems that a child could potentially identify. Don't make up an excuse. Don't lie. Man up and take responsibility for YOUR mistakes. It's easy for us to say these things, yes. But they're glaringly true. The sad thing is he knows these problems. But he refuses to say them, a fear of some sort. I love these lads, Klopp and LFC. However, I can't and the rest of us Reds will not stand idly by while we are laughed at and put in these horrendous performances. But no matter how many times we say this, we'll be ignored. Just watch when we win our next game and act like none of this happened. That's our fault. Anyway, this is just my opinion. Full respect to Brentford, great shift today. We just need to get our own priorities sorted.
Great win for Brentford, but I hope things turn around for Liverpool. It might sound strange at first but please hear me out 🙏🏼🙏🏽 Good works could never save men or persuade God. Our good deeds could never cover up our sins. We all broke God's law (eg. do not lie, do not steal, ..) and therefore stand guilty before God because of our sins. The only way we can be forgiven and be saved from the punishment of hell is if someone or something pays the price for our sins. It's as if you were in a court of law and have a stack of speeding fines, you cannot go free unless you pay them. In the same way we broke God's law, therefore sinned against God, and therefore are guilty, but Jesus Christ paid the fine for us, so that we don't need to go to hell. That's what he did on that cross, and through his life, death, & resurrection. God did this for us why? because He loved the world/us so much.   "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord." - Romans 8:38-39  What we all must do is turn from your sinful ways (repent) and put your faith and trust in the saviour Lord Jesus Christ 🙌🏽🙌🏼
Was it a grin or a grimmace? I haven't seen it. I'm betting that Nunez is feeling the pressure. And I wonder how many of those players realise that they'll be out come the summer and aren't putting in a real shift? Young hungry players vs tired old war horses. But I won't put it all on Klopp without knowing what's going on behind the scenes.
Hopefully you keep losing so that Bellingham has no intentions of going there
I’m a United fan, but must just say, your channel is so much better than Redmen TV. That is the most bland fan channel around and all they seem to do is try sell premium content and merch. Trying to milk your fellow fans is such a low move.  Congrats on your channel and congrats to brentford. That was lovely to watch. 😂
Craig you cant fight without fighters they don't care
Every-team that plays us plays the team that played the last game shait  we were so lucky against Leicester no midfield in that game yet klopp picks the same midfield Elliot was useless and Thiago
Liverpool going to Europa League 👍👍👍👍
We were shocking yet again, just like the Leicester game...but we were lucky in the Leicester game, I heard Jurgen's comments in the after game interview and in all of the comments he made which I thought most were rubbish, the five true words that he spoke were "We should have played better"  !!!!!
On a serious note I believe Klopp hasn't a notion anymore.  Midfield is a serious issue. Keep hearing about Bellingham there isn't a hope we will get him and why because we won't be in champions league next season. What a disgrace we gad it coming. Seems engine is running but nobody behind the wheel on the sidelines that is. Shambles Klopp.
If we dont get cm to at least to help us for top4 we can never sing big cm in the summer if we are not in CL, not a single top CM player will come to teram who dont play in CL and thats it
100% agree with you man.👌👌😩
3:21 konate😂
I'm with u hear I don't see the point in cross after cross as soon as trent had the ball it's a fucking cross fuck man run with make some passes five and goes through balls nope just fucking hoof it and hope bulshit football
Lat week spent another 40m on Gakpo and still cant win a match.  be lucky to get 6th
I came here because my food needed 🧂
Vvd is done....
Konate was crap
I got up at 4am to watch that crap.. How can Klopp & FSG expect people from all over the world to spend money on merchandise & wake up at ridiculous hours of the morning before work for that crap.. NOT GOOD ENOUGH... YNWA97
Craig you are spot on my friend
Coach not working wen a boxer keeps getting knocked out you change your coach owner's need to go Coach needs to be changed
Hold on to your hat there mate , no need to go completely mad ,not my idea of a true fan
Same shit same players talked about, starting to think klopp needs a shake
This team sucks and kloop does not care... we need hard change  no  on the back four VVD  need to sit..  Kloop enough bring someone who is ruthless.
I love the tears of Liverpool fans
Well I can't argue with a thing you said. For Klopp to say has faith in the squad tells me at least that at the moment he is a big part of the problem. No midfielders bought for over 4 years. We probably need 200 million of spending
First things first Elliot needs to be dropped…. Start playing Keita now he’s fit….not ideal but better than Elliott. Need to get Fabinho back up to speed also.
Klopp is laughing at 3-1 he is unserious
Craig as always you call it spot on, Liverpool are falling apart in front of our eyes and Klopp won't change and the owners won't spend the money needed
Didn’t feel confident atall when I seen Elliott on the team sheet. He’s had one good game, against woeful opposition in Rangers. Which is probably his level. Tiny, slow, weak, average with the ball. Not his fault and he gives his all for his club but he is out of his depth at this level.
The gift that keeps on giving...hilarious!
Fellow reds we have to take yet another one on the chin and maybe accept our days of winning 95% of our games are over for a while.
Baldbridge
🤣🤣🤣🤣🎉🎉🎉🎉
We lost get over it , 46 years lfc .
Very disappointed today, we played very poorly, with no heart, no desire, and no intensity, enough excuses. No top 4 for Liverpool this season.   FSG OUT
Anti liverpool as usual.  Some fans don't know what it's like to be a top manager.  It is difficult to play against 13 men.
kiss goodbye to the champions league 23-24.
The midfield is done and we need a new right full i
Just came here to laugh 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂 shit club bruv You shouldnt signed Darwin Punez 😂
Love this 🤣😂😂
Craig in all fairness we are shite all season, we were lucky against villa, and leicester, this is the worse liverpool team i've ever seen only alison is the one player this season who deserves credit, TAA cant defend but still he plays him there, elliott is the only player i know who passes the ball backwards all the time, and one question why did he bring on jones he wouldn't get a game with an old folks home. Use your common sense craig this season is a write off simply as, KLOPP OUT.
Craig do you know if Jude Bellingham like to play in the Europaaa league?? Please ask your insider about it. He must Love Liverpool Europaaa League NIGHTS at Anfield. He is dying for that!!!
Same shit, different year!! We liked like a beaten team when we stepped on the pitch! Awful performance from all tonight, coaching staff and players! Defence weren’t good enough again, midfield MIA again and miss firing up front again! As it stands top 4 is a dream, we are struggling in every department, is it May yet 🤔 as the players are on holiday already
VAR masterclass Best performance of the three teams that played today 😂
You cant blame klopp dont you dare
Every dog has its day and yours are gone now yous bought great but was it paul Mitchell hes gone now n yous are buying stickers panicking buying like man utd do theres a reason we didn't sign gakpo we need a striker n yous need a midfielder not a winger
Absolutely spot on. If I’m Jude Bellingham, I’m having second thoughts about whether Liverpool is the right club to join in the summer.
Craig please CAN you talk about Jude Bellingham, MAYBE he can magically reverse this score today!!
U can forget about Bellingham lol
I wanted carvalho to come on tbh, cld of bn 7-1.
Virgil looked very slow Harvey was very poor
I thought Nunez was very good. You cannot pick on him.
Klopp did nothing wrong there,  what I saw is how bad we need enforcement.
Elliot is also not strong or fast enough.
We have a lot of injuries. We need three midfielders and two defenders.. Chill out Craig. We nearly won the quadruple six months ago.
Think it's time Trent moved to the right side of midfield. Love Trent but his defending is costing us many goals.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
liverpool better off playing tiki taka fast thru pass , rather than defensive slow losing ball game , so sick of these its 2022 back again playing still nothing
💯 Craig
Fabinho and Thiago in the pivot, Gakpo and Salah as wingers, Carvalho in the 10 and Darwin up front. We need something different now instead of constantly forcing the 4-3-3.
I thought you were the mentality monsters though 🤷🏻‍♂️
Yet you play like it’s your World Cup final v city every year ?
I said the same klopp sood there with a smile on his face ox shit , kosta shit , why not play fabbio it was a disgrace ov a game robbo was the only one to make something, playing little passes not making big passes it's a joke
Seems Manchester United dodged a bullet by missing out on Darwin Nunez! Liverpool's midfield needs to be strengthened. I however think it's harsh to paint Klopp with abusive words. This is a Manager that has achieved a lot for Liverpool. If he's given players to fortify weak areas of the squad, he will most likely do better and that's the responsibility of the Club board and owners. I think Klopp deserves some respect no matter how small. He's won the league and champions league during his time at Liverpool so far. Great Managers do lose embarrassingly a couple of times too and Klopp is no exception! The players too have to share in the blame. This is just my humble opinion though.
Fsg out enough is enough
Please please Craig tell klopp don't play Elliott hes not good enough he's a championship player thats plain and simple
Do u think it’s time for some players to leave?
I know you dont like Curtis Jones but for goodness sake you can hardly blame him for the loss today its a bit strong man, we was crap and to a man Brentford sadly were better than us but again trying to understand why Curt Jones getting unnecessary stick for the poor showing when there was many a man worse than him today Harvey Elliott shouldn't be anywhere near Liverpool's midfield as good as he is he's not good enough for the first team but I doubt he'll get as much stick imagine Jones made the error Elliott made for the second goal you'd have jumped all over him.
Liverpool is gonna get bodied by RM in CL
Well well Baldbridge, that demise I called not too long ago, is coming true.
Salah has been sleeping since his 200k per week contract.
Kloop getting sacked in morning
Watch out Liverpool fans Brentford striker will be sighned by klopp next every a player has a good game against Liverpool he sighns em like minmino nunez and they turn out dud ones
And guest what? It’s against Brighton next away from home and I can already guess that Liverpool are gonna concede first again😢
all of the midfield cant create anything just trying luck and they are ageing their tactic too slow for prem
What happens when you cycle off the performance enhancers
Fabio getting the Shaqiri treatment from Klopp
Sack Klopp!
Nunez is horrible striker
Non of the goals should have stood ask Klopp..
that was painful
No Diaz no party
I see no agression and passion in our team it's like we are more focused on being a nice guy rather than the guy who wins.
I think at this point if we don't get a midfield signing or 2 the fans should start walking out especially if we go behind a "small" the past couple of games been disgusting even against Leicester city.
KLOPP HAS LOST THE PLOT
U gys we nid a new manager becoz  klop  wil 4eva rely on these old fakes
Toon fan well done Brentford and well done for this channels honestly. ⚽️⚽️⚽️👍
Klopp plays the same way every game need to change tactics
Awful we were pitaful Brentford deserved to win against us we were so poor the defending was shocking the midfield was like they were stuck in concrete at times i am so apauled by how bad we played, we need 2 midfielders and we need a defender wtf is klopp really looking at that midfield and saying yep that's okay oh hell no it's like we just didn't care there was no belief or passion where was the hunger klopp picked that team and chose the way to play we lost and we need 2 midfielders now sell ox and keita and loan Jones we need players who will work 100% for the badge on the shirt and not just make up the numbers. There is no papering over these cracks anymore we need 2 midfielders right now somthing has has to change fast
Take the Big L buddy 👍🏻
The minute you realise he's lost the plot you become a dangerous club again. Was a centre half and average sides go straight through middle of you like a non league side..but it's the refs, weather, injuries etc
Leicester scored 2 own goals in our 2-1 win, this was more of the same but Brentford were better all round and just wanted it more. The fact that we are still 4 points from top 4 is a miracle because we the season performance thus far have been diabolical. Sure City can cause us to raise our game because they a our Viagra team but otherwise we a terrible Front to Back.
Finally a brutally honest fan
Breaking news........Gakpo's just sacked his agent!
For goodness sake m8 done criticize klopp they’ll burn you at the stake he can do no wrong with the these deluded liverpool fans after all he’s won us 2 major trophiesin 8 yrs 😡
When my Spurs tied Brentford I was think they might just make it to the Europa or conference league this year. And with Spurs, Liverpool, Chelsea and West Ham all playing like shit I’m convinced of it. They are now 7th in the league. It’s incredible.
LFC Forever Family,  let's just calm down...
We have a shit load of midfielders and at this stage none of them good enough,  Henderson and fabinhio gave great service but it's over fir them , tiago flatters to deceive,  best described as a luxury player , keita Jones ox Elliott not good enough
Our problem is Klopp!
I give up with Nunez. He's not a footballer.
I think chamberlain did well today
Give Nunez shooting practice
Elliott and Ox needs get the F out of the starting lineups.
Me's to say lad the corn has overly been cooked as ma granny used to say on a Christmas dinner.  The manager needs to go Before we pray 🙏 for all.
Why Liverpool players so static no movement off the ball can't dribble and move backwards when the midfielders carry the ball forward
Gakpo instantly regretting not joining Utd 😂
Mannn..I'm so angry....their is bajcetic and calvarho on bench...FSG if we don't get midfielders were chasing you like the glazers sell sell sell....sell Jones.. Chamberlain milner..all these old guys...klopp u want to use the same team forever
Sorry to say but we need a new striker, nunez is shit
Wow. Very accurate assessment. Spot on commentary.
I already stop watching Liverpool match cos am tired of the none consistent. Chamberlain has to go..so sad we don't have defenders or a quality midfielders
Yall deserve this hyping up like loserpool is the best club in the world lmao
Konate is the one to blame he played like a donkey
To be fair craig, klopp knows we need players but unless FSG sanction anything he just has to play the PR game and pretend everything is going superbly.
I hat did Salah do yo deserve to even be on the pitch, he doesn’t make a challenge at any time in a game. I agree about the jones decision but Salah doesn’t even look like he wants to be there. At least Ox makes a challenge against the opposition, Salah shits out of every challenge. We play with 10 men every week
Why the club buying forward when the midfield is full of mummies and the defence is cheese?
I am a Brighton fan but I like this fellas take on Liverpool games.
Nunez is shit call a spade a spade
It could be 5-1 💀☠️
SACK PLS KLOPP!!!!!!!
Our main problems can be summed up in 5 letters. "KLOPP";  No question he's not improving the players weaknesses nor the team  performance from week to week.
People saying there's no problem in the forward line, there is nunez can't score,
This the worst team liverpool have ever had time for  a total cleanout all round .Time for Klopp to get out and  go. He was smiling after that garbage  he must be getting paid  by someone else . I said it when he came Nunez that he was the worst signing we have ever  made .Everyone said I was mad to say that am I was having a go at Nunez I will never be convinced that he has any talent .Craig says he will be great sorry mate you are talking shite  and not only Nunez time for Elliott to be loaned Thiago played for Real Madrid  really they must have seen us coming Not one good player left in this team. Rubbish utter rubbish .
Manbun FC 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why don’t you admit your not great team
I am a Bees fan and have been for 50 years and watched us in div 4 to now and went home and away for many years. Why is it every time we play a game weather it's man city away ,Liverpool at home ,man utd at home, Chelsea away, Brighton at home or whoever it may be and we win ,why why is it all the opposition fans think there team are shite.people need to wake up to the fact we have an amazing manager who is so tactically switched on, we have an amazing owner who is Brentford through and through and our results since been in the premiership have been amazing.on another night tonight's game could have been a classic 5_4 win to the bees tonight. Brentford deserved this win because we play with a spirit unseen since the dizzy wombles back in the late 80s early 90s ,but we also play some fantastic football at times. You was beat by a better team tonight fact.
This once excellent Liverpool side has just gone over the hill.
nunez can't play center forward he's better on the left....
We have lost the cutting edge in attacking,are defense is crumbling,and the mid field have been sliced apart .
Well Said Craig 👏
I am starting to think that whenever Nunez is playing and we are playing balls on him we are playing so bad. Klopp should revert back to play with false 9 like we played year or 2 years ago with Firmino. I know Jota and Bobby are injured but we played so better in that system. That system basically unlocked Salah and Mane then. Now we play all the balls to Nunez who cant score or hit the target for love of god. I geniuinly thing buying Nunez was mistake. He will be good but he doesnt suit our playstyle.  This just proves that Klopp cant adapt to new system with Nunez on top
I am at a loss with this team, so many problems. I dont think we will make top 4, that's not me being negative just realistic. Arsenal, city, Utd and Newcastle look far better than us at minute.  Maybe, just for now we need to switch to wing backs. Trent cant defend, so maybe 3 at back and two midfielders ball winners in middle. Let's face it, the midfield Is dogs hit. I dont actually rate any of them, thiago included. He is best of a bad bunch but lightweight and too injury prone. Never mind Belingham, if we get him. We need 3 midfielders
That was absolutely pathetic
Konate cost us two goals. he was extreemly poor
Konate, big muscular lad like him wanting a free kick for the goal🤬🤬. Carvalho, great talent but he's like a skinny school kid, gets push around far to easily, needs to fill out. We're a tired team. Oxlade should of gone age's ago, i can only think it's to do with his wages and contract, and let's face it his hunger, other club's won't have a player like that hanging around.
The criticism given to Nunez here should be given almost every week, apart from 2-3 decent games he does the same, always offside, not clinical, bad decision making, etc
So its Klopp out then Craig I think its time to own up and spit it out man.
Is it caffeine recovery/withdrawal from last year having an influence on Liverpool's game?
Ox played well today,
To start with take nothing away from Brentford they played their game perfectly and deserved the win !!  Liverpool on the other hand where do you start? Any one that says this team isn't in need of a complete overhaul is kidding themselves.. The team was shocking. Yes you could pick out some positives but take a good hard look. The defense was all over the place our midfield kept moving sideways and our forward line cant score goals.. Not wanting to pick on individual players as the team was awful but how long are we going to keep protecting Nunez? I see people keep referring to him as a raw talent but for the money we paid he should be much closer to being the finished article. The major issue is that now teams keep picking apart our highline.. is it that they know how to play us?? maybe but Man city have played a similar style for the last few season and they are still winning.. so maybe this suggests our squad just isn't aging well we need investment in the team urgently !!!
Half of these players don't deserve wearing liverpool shirts
Klopp has kill this team this year by saying on the media that we don't need a midfielders, now we are paying for his negligence . Elliot and OX shouldn't start for liverpoor
Honestly I have to say fabhino was god fucking awful, he lost the ball many times and just wasn't really putting in the work. Gakpo's probably shitting himself at the fact that he's gonna have kostas tsimikas, curtis jones, harvey elliot, darwin nunez (current form), ox and trent who can't defend alongside him trying to beat a really strong and improved wolves team
As Klopp's empire crumbles Arteta'a rises
Embarrassing
Why do u always rave on about carvalho?? He does nothing when he plays!!
When a team is already loaded with attackers and have a drought of midfielders what shall they do? Go and buy more strikers and let the drought become more worse. LMAO.
Bad selection, what was Klopp thinking?
I am Klopp fan and i have faith in him but i totally agree! Our midfield is very weak. Midfield like Fab, Thiago or Ox or Elliot is just joke. Fabinho can play good but if Klopp put Elliot who defensivelly cant do shit and Thiago who is more like CAM type of midfielder he cant expect to win these matches. Dont even start with Ox. Idk why is Klopp still playing him. To raise his price😂He needs to go..he is not good enough after his injury sadly.  Agree on Carvalho over Jones. We are losing and he decided to put Jones who is average at the best and literally contributing nothing to attack or defence. Carvalho could do something. He is attacking midfielder and it makes sense to put him on pitch when we are losing  absolute joke today...i am glad at least i didnt watch it because of my work and just heard and saw the result
Hi everyone if your saying you need more in midfield and klopp needs funds. But he's been given funds and not buying were supporters are crying out for midfield but he's buy striker instead. Diaz Nunez gakpo. Don't worry about nunes misses overall he will come good.  I thought Curtis Jones was supposed be next big thing  when he scored winner against blues in cup match few years ago. To be honest not seen him much past 18months
Everyone knows the blitz from Liverpool.    Can thrry be a finesse team?
I blame Klopp for this loss. No commitment, no hunger and you tell me we don't need midfielder, Bull. We will never make top four.
Time to put Trent in midfield and buy defensive right back
Unfortunately Jürgen is too loyal to players that aren't performing and too stubborn to change his style of play.  Maybe his time to go? Can't believe I'm thinking that
People who blame the owners are clueless..klopp had an option to go for midfielder in January but klopp opted for a striker..sometimes I don't understand klopp
Forget 4th place or even 6th the way it is going.
This is shades of AFTV level of analysis here... capitalising on distress, this is really dishonest and toxic.  There is a lot to be annoyed about here but it seems like you more interested hounding the lads and Jurgen. The only feasable changes he could have made to the squads where Keita for Harvey and Ox for Carvaliho. Ox did fine and Harvey could have done better defensively, sure.   This happened to be a game where a lot went wrong for a lot of players, it happens. Lets not lose our heads here, Brentford have beaten a lot of great teams this season. There is nothing wrong with pointing out our lad's faults this game but it's not fair to rip them apart the way you have here. We are not Arsenal fans.   Also... Jurgen is literally chasing Amrabat, Bellingham and Casedo around. That is enough to confirm that Jurgen knows we need midfielders.
Very hard to watch that game. Bleak is an understatment. I agree, We need to get a midfielder, 100% correct. Stop wasting time and spend the cash on Bellingham! II also agree Nunez will come good but FFS why does he crumble the second hes 6 feet from goal. Gutted!
Leicester own goals hid how bad Liverpool really are
Playing Kostas and Elliot on the right is a kin to match fixing by klopp, top six is fight we are in
Dead in the water performance. Congrats to Brentford, they did everything we can't anymore.
Encouraging gambling - All about the money no longer about supporting your team
The midfield and defending is absolutely disgraceful, klopp needs to make some signings in January or this crap will keep happening
Jude's dad is liking tweets apologising to him for Liverpool fans begging for Jude in his comments on his latest tweet. Embarrassing.   Here's one he like: please ignore all the lfc fans being begs, promise you we’re not all like that, it’s only a small minority 🤝
Liverpool stunk the place out tonight, well played Brentford
Very well said Jones shite ox shite what do us kloop think he will get from these players. he owes them nothing. Midfield sort it now we want money just sack FSG everyone get on ban wagon rip fsg please fuming though my phone in the gym smashed it Craige pls ramp it up keep going pls mate
Nunes?really?the guy is a joke
As a chelsea fan ,you guys are even better than us
This is real. How can anybody be confident with Liverpool when they never perform when they play.
Honestly we definitely need new players but a team doesnt just decline like that. The fact is mentality wise we are gone and being mentally strong can give us momentum and we completely lack that. A lot of teams do well w mentality and drive alone like us in the last couple seasons because we weren’t a crazy good side on paper.   The main issue I have is out tactics. We play it too safe and on so many occasions I want us to take risks and not just pass sideways. We used to have more options to attack in different ways and yet w some more players coming in, we have actually lost those different options, defensively our tactics are terrible w spaces everywhere and klopps unwillingness to change is now costing us.  In the midfield we are overran but again the space is just there because of the players positioning and especially when our key players cant keep the ball or pass it makes us so vulnerable.   In attack theres virtually no movement and the lack of space makes it impossible to work and score.  Things need to change. We need a club doctor to prevent the barrage of injuries. We need new midfielders this January. We need bellingham and gvardiol if possible in the summer. most importantly we need klopp to change tactics and adapt.
I love Jurgen, but the only acceptable reaction to that shambolic performance is fury.
Suiiiiiiii
Klopp acts like an idiot sometimes
The number of chances they got show we need more protection from the midfield. Elliot isnt good enough to play midfield. We need at least 3 midfielders now or we aren’t getting top 4
We are not clinical enough in front of goal
Liverpool were blessed in their last game - they have been playing shit for months and months - back to normal - fighting for 4th every season.
Why does Klopp keep playing the same way?? He pushes the defence up to and often beyond the halfway line, which is fine if our defence is amazing! Our defence has been shit ALL SEASON!!
Finally someone saying jones isn’t good enough. And most of the current midfield .  Klopp wants to keep firminio , he’s past it ! This is part of the problem keeping players past their prime now we have an aging team !
Ngl as a Liverpool fan I only see the season getting worse because don't think the owners are willing to spend on a midfielder
Our midfield breaks when Thiago and Elliot plays in midfield. Nunez is a headache, why Ox instead of Carvalho? Coach having his favorite players play all the time even if they suck. FSG not wanting to invest. This team is on my nerves wtf
Gakpo must be thinking get me back to PSV
We were fucking woeful. We need midfield reinforcements asap!!!
What's up with the Carvalho love? He's not a savior, he's a 20 year old and he's been incredibly average lately. And if you throw him into a failing situation he becomes part of it, and he becomes the new target of the fans just like Elliott. What do you think that'd do for the boy's confidence?
Klopp is as stubborn as  mouse. Waste money, time effort at warm weather training   Should have stayed at home Learnt nothing just rubbish
Puñez and Gakpoo will save u 🤣 never your fault
So sick of seeing elliot start tbh
We did so bad we need a midfielder now
What a shite team
Liverpool needs Díaz backs he was the only consistent attacker we had.
What a shocker from Liverpool! I could not bear the sight of watching the full game. The sooner we get new players the better. I am not happy that Fabio Carvalho is not being played and we instead play Naby, OX, Harvey Elliott ahead of Fabio, why did we buy him from Fulham - to bench him! I am disappointed with the performance. As for Trent, he always looks lost on on crosses and there are lots of ? on his defensive abilities. Let’s see what happens next.
Love this man
You bees 🐝
So frustrating seeing us play the exact same football the whole game and getting nowhere. All we do is pass it back and forth in the midfield, eventually get it out wide to someone like Trent or Elliot, then 9/10 a cross gets whipped in which is dealt with easily by their defence.  We need some new tactics or something idk, I’m not a football coach but we literally do the same thing every game and teams just sit back then catch us on the break.
It’s not surprising that Liverpool are missing shots. We have one of the worst shots to goals ratios in the league over the last 3 season in my opinion. We take so many shots from ridiculous angles and the only reason we were able to win games was since we were able to put the opposing team on the back foot with our press and now that the press isn’t giving them us the time and space to take all these 20 shots, we are losing to more clinical teams that work to score with a lower shot count to Liverpool
Only for Alisson this season Liverpool wouldn’t even be in a top 4 race , Defence has been a shambles all this season
RMA will kill us if we not buy a mid soon
Carvalho my ass. The teams in the world cup proved that if you have big fit men and a bit of belief you can match anyone. Something has gone awry with us we are not playing for each other. Team spirit is gone missing. Interesting dilemma for Klopp. Darwinian maybe.
Klopps too comfortable as well he knows they (FSG) won’t fire him
Before anyone starts having a go, I do think we need to be honest with ourselves about klopp, he is a very good manager, but he is a better person. There is no doubting that, but let's be honest, he is the reason our squad is such a mess, any other manager would of sold the players that are constantly injured, and the fact he has let our team age so much is unforgivable, I'm not saying he should be sacked, but if he did go at the end of the season I wouldn't mind either, It cant just be a coincidence that he had a nightmare season when he enters his 7th season at a club, it's happened at every club he has managed, I feel maybe his style of play is only ok short term if that makes sense, and I'm sorry but signing Gakpo won't make the slightest difference, not with our midfield, signed Nunez when he could if got a midfielder and better striker than Nunez with that money, I love Harvey Elliot he is such a good kid, and a heart of gold, but he isn't a top 4 club player. Stick him in a mid table club and he will be amazing, but top 4 he isn't anywhere near ready, should of loaned him out for this season. He isn't ready yet. YNWA. Also need to start searching for a vvd replacement, i don't konate being that, although he is top quality.
How much did Nunez cost ?
How much did Nunez cost ?
Klopp should resign with dignity and hand over to someone else it’s just not working anymore
Klopps either lost the dressing room or the players are not good anymore
Klopp's constant refusal to substitute Van Dijk, thereby making him play 100 minutes every game is no good. When the team is 2-3 goals up with 10-20 minutes left, replace him - take the risk so that he can be rested. The midfield is something that the owners refuse to address. Tactics don't evolve because of the lack of players too. Main issue - the owners.
Physical Team like Brentford licked thier lips when they saw Liverpool playing high line while having a poor defense and no midfield. I am a United Fan but Man, it was all about Trent/Roberston to Salah and Nunez, no in between. Sign midfielders if You have to save this season. Enjoying your downfall, not gonna lie 👍
Complacency....
jude is coming to madrid
Brentford are cool as fuck! ;D
I'm done with this manager the stubbornness is out of the park.  No one is bigger than the club people should wake up klopp is a problem. Like you mention Craig  why isn't carvalho getting game time? Why has Curtis Jones been handed a contract extension for doing nothing? It looks to me klopp has his so called favourites he can't move away from them
I’ve never disagreed with you before Craig and I don’t today an absolute mess needed to hear it from another Liverpool fan to make my self feel agreed with
Nunez.. we can't afford to 'wait ' until he becomes a good player who scores goals we need him to right now. When salah has a drop in form there is nobody and nothing else
We should be playing 3 tenacious energetic defensively solid players in midfield if we going to play high line with our full backs in opposition half. Our midfield was never overly creative a few years back but they pressed hard.
You are right mate some of our players were in a trance defence 💩
@anfieldagenda klopp just doesn't want to admit he is wrong about the midfield situation
We need a new midfield this is not good enough . Come on klopp do something we are awful.
This is the first time I turned alil on klopp that was our worst performance this season when it was looking like it's turning around.
WHAT A DISASTER, KLOPP, THE PLAYERS NOT GOOD ENOUGH SHIT
The fact that we’re starting and bringing on players that wouldn’t even start for Brentford like Ox and Jones says it all to me. Not even just down to a lack of depth or funds at this point. Also blind loyalty to mediocrity from Klopp. Never seen a team so disjointed under him, no plan at all. Even in our FIRST PARTIAL SEASON under him we looked better than this…
Liverpool playing like Chelsea, both teams have talent that play like winning is simply deserved.
Maybe it is time to go Jurgen?!
Has Fab & Stefan on bench who have scored coming off it this season but brings on fucking Jones 🤷🏻‍♂️
No banter just enjoy your videos
Keita, Jones, Elliott, Fabio Carvalho, Ox - good players ... but are they good enough?  They just don't seem to have the quality ... and all of the LFC squad seem like they're on the 65th game of the season ... where's the fitness? where's the passion? where's the effort? where's the team pressing? where's the creativity?  where's the confidence?  Nunez doesn't look good enough ... but he and Salah are not getting the service from midfield.  Mind you both of them need to defend more up the pitch where the pressing should start, and where Mane excelled.  So many mistakes, so little instinctive communication, sloppy passes and an inability to carve Brentford open.  We know what TAA is amazing at, and we know his weaknesses ... why doesn't the team then adjust to exploit his strength and provide more cover for his weaknesses.  These players need a rocket up their you know whats ... this is just not good enough. They can be better.  If they can't raise their quality to the level expected, then they should realize they have to go.  All of them need to take a leaf out of Robbo, Hendo and Milner's books about passion, fitness, drive and commitment.   Never thought I'd have to ask, but to many of the LFC players ... do you really care about our club any more?
Our solution is starring at us in our face. Play trent in midfield. He can't defend. We get it already.
Klopp is a great manager but is too stubborn to change, a world class manager can adapt while klopp in my opinion is not able to
We just need to make Klopp OUT
Our midfield is so bad. We need them to provide goals and help in defence but they do none of that. If im correct our main 4 defenders have 5 goals this season and out main 3 midfielders have 0 goals this season….
Load of shite. Well done Brentford
I blame klopp and this pathetic high line week in week out It's clear to see It's useless,klopp hasn't got the knowledge to change tactics and surprise the opposition unacceptable and how Chamberlain got yet another game is beyond me followed by useless curtis jones.Unacceptable klopp,jurgen why dont you give every player a kite so they can play higher-up.
Without mane it's a different team Salah is half a man and nunez is half a brain
Liverpool needs a new feel
Klopp needs to go
Harvey Elliot was abysmal
Imo trent did not do anything wrong no disrespect
Frank's for klopp by nxt season
I see you never call that annoying Harvey Elliot who can’t pass tackle head or dribble biggest liability Harvey Elliot
FSG and Klopp Out
Bro needs to be smart and needs to change the gameplan
Jurgen Roy Hodgson.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😄🤣😄
KNTG
klopp needs to go
and this is without toney!!!!
I love klopp to bits but very unhappy with selection. Very complacent. I'm telling you Cody could have also played today but decided last night not to rush through papers before midday. Would have been useful on bench. We only had one proper attack minded player on bench in carvalho yet didn't come on. SHAMEFUL what has happened with klopp with fast flowing football. Terrible even Jones on Bench when no way fit. Has played hardly any football last two years and yes folks trust me Jones has hardly trained much last two years due to many issues including growth. I know carvalho and esp doak young but bloody play them rather than others from bench even when needing a goal. Both are very capable and in bens case very pacey and direct. I was surprised how fast and more  importantly how good he was in training live. Have to say these things as I'm rarely upset but first thing I looked at was bench with only really carvalho on it. Jurgen please don't protect the young talent too much and only use in league cup games or if 4-0 up. I'm so convinced Ben would have made a big difference coming on in such a big game when opposition no little about him. He was needed today for bench due to the absences of jota, Diaz, bobby, Cody.  Don't think of his birth date. He is more than good enough now esp today on bench ahead of most there. Even had 3 central bloody defenders on bench matip, Gomez, Philips. Really no point cannot good enough management in this situation.
This is not Liverpool. We need 2 midfielders Urgently
We need to put trust on bajcetic. Rn he looks like our best midfielder. I’m serious. His last 2 games he did everything right. He helped trent, had a work rate and good distributions. HE CAN COVER FOR TRENT
Will someone please return klopps glasses he's not see what we're see
It’s so sad to see Liverpool like this.. I’m dreading Wolves on the weekend..
klopp confuses me sometimes , why we playing ox is beyond me.... Puts in a ball hogger Jones instead of Carvalho who can make things happen. Salah should be benched he's just useless lately , literally no assest from him what's so ever , can't dribble past a player , doesn't make a challenge and when he goes for a shot it's when he has zero chance to score. Keira is mehh I dunno perhaps trys to be to fancy with his play when a simple pass can make a much bigger difference, instead of him I would of played Bajtetic who's in form and has much better vision even tho he's a defending midfielder. Nunes needs to stop overthinking and jst get a clean shot because when he does that the ball tends to go in , unlucky today but overall good performance.  We really misong Diaz and Jota , can't wait for Gapko to start , can't watch Ox who's always out of position and can't pull single defender with him to stretch the tight defences. We struggle vs teams who sit back and just defend , the highline don't work for us anymore as we don't have the press we use to have , 4 3 3 isn't the formation we should be using , we played much better with 4 2 3 1, way more solid at the back and good control in midfield , people always talk about our rubbish defence but the truth is that we are fialing in that part because the midfield gives the ball away way to easy and have no control in that part of the pitch. Changes needs to be made and some called stars should be benched , cold shower does help and I'm hoping we come back from this stronger.  But that is just my opinion , YNWA
I have been thinking a lot about Tuchel lately. I never thought I would turn on Klopp but…It is not just the results but the way they just keep on smiling and pretend that everything is fine that infuriates me.
I’m so confused as to why Carvalho isn’t being played at all like what did he do
personally, I do not see what Elliot is bringing to the team, do not get wrong, he is still developing but that is not the kinda player we need to be at the top of the table.. As soon as I see the line-up, Elliot, Tsimikas and OX. I Knew right away that we are in trouble. I see no justification in benching Keita for Elliot when he is fully  match fit, especially when we are playing away from home.  We did not deserve to win vs Leicester. We gave the points back today. We are still comparing this team with the one we had previously, the Mane, Firmino, Salah at their top form. Sorry we cannot finish top 6 six this season with this set of players.
Klopp won't even buy another player too and we lose to Brentford aswell icing on the cake. Klopp's loyalty to these players are crazy this needs to change or Europa conference league is where we are going  to be.
Hahahah. eat it you bald get
Shocking poor defence and non existence midfield
When are you going to criticise FSG ????
Klipp is finished.
Why can't they just buy midfilder 😢
Carvalio to lightweight on the ball. That's why he's not playing
Brentford wanted it more simple we are a spent force and klopp as no idea how to change it
Klopp is in denial about his midfield, the planning around fixing the midfield is poor, and has not been addressed properly since Gerrard left
Curtis Jones is trash
Didn't replace midfield years ago.Too much dead wood and too many injured players
He knows wtf we need Craig only problem  I have with klopp is him not putting pressure on our owners to soend money he won't speak out against fsg keeps them happy which is bullshit so don't sit there and complain about him smiling use don't complain when he does it then we end up winning the game so can't have it both ways
I've heard they want to be in champions league  next season playing among the best team in EU and they can't even beat Brentford.....hmmm , they can kiss goodbye to Jude signing for them ...f ing loosers.
This was coming after the average performances during the Xmas period. Klopp has his favourites that he plays no matter what the situation is. Yes we are desperate for some midfield players yet as always Klopp doesn't fancy anyone. It seems to be Jude Bellingham or no one for him come the summer when we need someone now. I am beginning to think that Klopp is the problem here not wanting to sign anyone more then the owners he seems to be pointing the finger at. I feel that this could be the end of Jurgen Klopp as our manager.
Even with new signings none gon change😥
This is the real Liverpool
This is a good loss. It’s a reality check. It’s good that it has come now. It shows how vulnerable we are. We need a midfield faster
Why did I get this Liverpool tattoo!!
What gets me the most is the thickleness of the fanbase. Had Gomez been playing today in place of Konate and performed like that, people would be standing outside his house with pikes.
Klop out!
Elliot, Ox, Konate, Thsymikas, Nunez. All shite. You ain't getting top 4.
I'm the Red fan from Cambodian, I don't want to see the livpool  terrible performance, where is reall the Red? Really I unhappy  with Konate and Dawin, however, I hop next game they are well done.
We need two mid FIELDERS bad...
U are 100 percent correct with whatever u said..
The truth
Players have no structure and seem clueless on pitch
Got your arses slapped
Klopp had brought this on Liverpool by refusing to get rid of dead wood - Gomez,Matip,Milner,Thiago,Keita,Fabihno,Ox,Jones and Firmino
Our midfield has been allowed to grow old and doesn't have the energy and legs. This in turn allows teams to run right through us and go at the defense, Van Dijk is getting exposed and hasn't been the same player since his injury at Everton. TAA seems to just check out when it comes to doing his defensive duty and this ends up with Matip or whichever centerback is playing his side get pulled out of position or exposed. The only player that has turned up this season is Alison.  The squad has looked leggy, tired and burnout the majority of this season.
I agree with everything you said
Yip I was lambasted by liverpool fans when I said we dont have 1 midfielder that's good enough to be in a title challenging team . Once upon a time they were but not anymore.  Hendo should be doing Milners job coming off the bench , Milner , ox , keita should not be at the club anymore, elliot is too young, Jones isn't and never will be good enough , Fabinho is a shadow of what he once was . And what did Matip do that he got benched ? VVD looks past it , Konate shouldn't start immediately,   he should be coming off the bench to ease his way back into the team . I'm all for supporting Darwin but at some point he needs to repay the faith being shown in him and why is Salah constantly isolated when he is our biggest goal threat .
Playing the high line away to Brentford (who are a cracking little team) was suicide. That was where we lost it. Our quick forwards on the counter was the only way to win this game, yet we tried to set up high and dominate and create through the middle, What a farce. Shambolic management again from Klopp. He really seems to have gone off the boil man, it's almost painful to watch. Ox was actually our best offensive player today IMO, and thats not saying much, but he worked hard, made some decent passes and scored a goal, what can be said of the rest?
well said.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Your 100% right Craig that’s why I watch your channel you say how it is with some other channels say fuck all just protect their channel 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 🗣FSG OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!
Stop moaning at KLOPP,  we were bad at the back, not many chances created for forwards.  Trent and Kanote were poor, don't pick on our left back. Stop your whining and moaning. Did you lose your bet tonight. Stop slagging Curtis Jones you wanker. The match was lost before he came on. Negatively don't sole problems. Only Arsenal have won at Brentford.
Congratulations to Brentford, I like to watch them play this season. Konaté  was terrible today, but apart from his performance, let's not forget that he played the World cup final with the flu, while others were playing friendlies in Dubai. Klopp is to blame too for not buying any midfielders but plays Keita, Elliott, Jones 🙄 but hey, the guy 'doesn't want to pay 120 millions for a midfielder' and he thinks he is funny for saying that.
Our game plan is way to slow giving teams enough time for teams to bunch their defence against us
The high line has been killing us since the start of last season,Where's plan B?Where's the great Pep Linders tactics🤔
Got lucky against Leicester and got what was deserved against Brentford.
Klopp saying its a push on ibou oh god sometimes in life we have to be honest with ourselves
And one more point I’m sick to the back teeth of Trent Alexandra Arnold….. he can’t defend bad basic defending also! We have to seriously think about changing formation I’ve said this for a while if he plays Trent which he does week in week out he has to play three at the back and push Trent further up the pitch and stop all this school boy defending from him week in week out 😡
Someone's not very happy!
Trent’s too fucking lazy!! Zero passion shown from the entire team. At least try Doak when you need something, the lads direct and will go at them instead of predictable and sideways.
Utter bollocks, and what the fuck was up with the white socks?!
Everyone keeps saying Nunez will come good? Nunez is a fucking meme already 🤣
😂😂😂
Only good thing today was watching fabino eillet should not play for Liverpool, but we deserve to lose
Nunez needs to run and run and walk the ball into the net.  His shooting is awful so he needs to keep running and reduce the angle and the distance.
Was it really?  Maybe you just under estimated Brentford especially when they are at home.
FSG OUT!!!!!
Nunez might come good when he goes
What a strange old season. Arsenal must be smelling the Duraglit.
Looked like little boys with no clue every time there was a corner. Terrible! Salah just doesn't seem to move into good spaces, Ox barely there, Elliot, sorry just isn't ready, and definitely not in midfield. And I was like it's over! When he brought Jones on. Crying out for reinforcements, I'd have snatched Salah off and stuck Doak (If he was even on the bench) on, because there was nothing going on, either wing really. Scary.
Utterly clueless a joke of a performance klopp needs to wake up or get going I've not seen a half of football like it
Konate and Trent can't defend
I would also sell Trent as need money spent other areas. Ramsey is as good as Trent when fit!! I'm unsure of Elliott and prob sell Jones although prob not worth enough. Thiago time nearly up as luxury would need other runners around. Terrible treatment of carvalho I know wasn't happy with previous performance but young and good. Hopefully 80 mill for trent
I'm angry ,upset n whatever
Haven't we been watching this mmmdross for to long now
We have the worst defense in the Premier league
Everyone on Darwins case but it's hiding the fact salah is way off it can't wait to see gakpo jota Diaz and  start pushing them in the team I was dreading todays game I seen it coming shocking performance
Tell us what u really think 😁😁
You could see it coming a mile off. We have no midfield and we continue to play a ridiculously high line despite not having said midfield. We were always going to get bullied by Brentford. We have no intensity or desire anymore.   I honestly think we're done in the market. The owners are content to rely on what we've got. We've needed change for literal years, it's driving me insane that they either can't see it or just don't care.
Is everyone okay? Are we going to forget what klopp has done to the club? Getting rid of the shit players out the club and bringing class in without even spending a penny. Yes these season has been poor but weve been overexeeding for years now. Craig you also say hes going to pick the same clowns week after week but uve said in the last few weeks bajcatic and the other youngsters are to young, also if we did pick other players and lose yet again you would be moaning about the same shit and blaming klopp again for making changes
The team is not good enough. We have an aging team they are not quick enough to deal with the young blood in other team. KLOPP is not pro active enough. Salah was useless.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
what does elliott even do?
Also as highly as I rate Carvalho, he has been inconsistent and below average and although he will definitely come good I can't stand the thought of putting him in while we are playing like crap only to have his confidence smashed thanks to poor team performances and unrealistic pressure on a 19 year old who hasn't had time to gel in the first team
Spot  on👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Fuckiiiiinnng HELL we could not pass Brentford WE NEED MIDFIELDERS
Arnold was the problem at beginning now the whole team is a problem except Arnold
Fucking embarrassing again
Surely we have to start looking at klopp for what’s happening he’s making for to many mistakes this season the team is a shambles we’re playing terrible football we’re awful to watch his team selection is questionable his changes are confusing his tactics are hard to understand and it’s getting worse 😡
Every word u said was spot on Jones should not even be at LFC And as u said Klop grinning like a idiot is doing my head In.
This was comming, man City hit us for 3,villa could have had 4,leicester gifted us 3 points with 2 ogs, now the D day has arrived. Simply put LFC this season barring a few games are pure rubbish. I can forgive anything in football but when a team have no belly for the fight and throw in the towel this is unacceptable. The results this season falls squarely on all their shoulders... players not putting in 100%, poor management and poor owner investment. This team peaked last year and for the last 10 games of last season they seemed to be  weary. There is no point continuing with 433 formation because the central 3 can't defend in front of their defence the result is the opposition runs through us and finds space for chances. We conceded FIVE goals today against Brentford this tells us all we need to know. This team is in serious decline it needs serious investment into serious quality players. OX KEITA MILNER JONES are of no use to LFC going forward and will have to leave......QUE FSG
Trent decides to play as a midfielder not running to the by line as he used to , and he's wondering why he has 1 assist this season. We haven't seen the best of Carvalho cause he hasn't been played in the correct position , and the fucking bellend decides to play the same fucking people all the time. Jones and chamberlain are fucking shit man.
Sorry but people calling for Klopp out are absolute clowns. Dismal and appalling performance today and I'm glad we didn't get a lucky point from a performance that bad because maybe the club will get more motivation for transfers.  You can't possibly blame Klopp for the absolute crap storm we have for a bench. The only non defenders on the bench I wanted to come on were bajcetic or Carvalho, two youngsters who are inconsistent and still our best sub options. The fact that Klopp has basically said the club won't fund further transfers is fuckin atrocious. No depth, not even a good enough starting 11.  Having said all that, you nailed the attitude thing for today. Idk what was wrong with them but there is nothing more frustrating to watch than players putting in fuck all effort for 80 minutes.
First if all. YOU Don't know the first thing about managing a football team. It's very easy for you to rant here about how Klopp is crap but last week you were praising him. You don't know anything about kicking a ball. You don't know anything about scheduling training, player fatigue, squad rotation, diet or exercise. You don't know anything about player motivation. You can't even define a tactic. You don't know how to develop just one player in 10 years while a manager must develop 26 players in 3 months. If you were given 11 of the best players in the world right now even 22 players, I'm talking the Mbappes and Halaand and whoevers of this era, you'd probably get relegated out of an EFL Championship side anyways. It's very easy for you to speak out here in your corner of YouTube because your lack of knowledge wouldn't be exposed. I'm so HAPPY that Liverpool football players don't watch your channel otherwise they probably wouldn't be any good performances from them.
Need a complete overhaul - Liverpool are shite!!
Damn we miss diaz
🥸 "Curtis showed real quality when coming on."
Why no Fabio carvalho not come off Bench!!! Other guys nowhere near 100% fit and ageing ahead of him I e ox, Jones etc. No doak on bench!! With no Cody, Diaz,bobby and jota. Need to play carvalho and Ben doak more. I don't care what age they are. Doak best youngster and basically dropped for been outstanding in limited games and friendly s. Bloody fa cup game klopp thinking. This year more than ever top 4 crucial to also stop others man utd and particularly Newcastle. When klopp first came very fast football. Some are now past their best including even Salah whose pace is going. Needs to rest him more and play the brilliant doak whom I've been fortunate enough to see live and train quite recently. Needs to be unleashed now. Other clubs like Barca, man utd, etc play their very best youngster and doak is even better than that young Argentine who plays games for man utd despite not having as many injuries as lfc.
Look we all love Liverpool the fact we signed one midfielder in four years is intolerable. Liverpool in deep trouble unless major changes we got no chance of top 4 .  We got Real Madrid in February can’t see beating Brighton
JFT39
Milner,Henderson,Thiago, Fabinho all are above 29. Keita, Oxlade Chamberlain are perennially injured. FSG won't buy a damn midfielder in January. So Bellingham isn't gonna come to Liverpool to play Europa league football. Best of luck playing Thursday night football.
Glory glory Man United
Chamberlain  scored in the second half that's why he wasn't subbed  😂😂
Agree 100% with everything you said. We were total shite today. Not good enough.
get a new midlfielder as well as a replacement for fabinho, he makes WAY too many mistakes. push thiago up the pitch where he is best at
Dalot is better than trent
I am furious than you Craig I wish I could also speak my mind to Klopp and his players
We need a propper fucking no. 10
I can’t believe how Klopp can’t fix the problems at all.. Every game same problems. Consede a first goal, too high defensive line and shit defending corners or set pieces etc…
I cant watch Liverpool like this the team are playing bad i know klopp can only do so much the players aint standing up diaz & jota please come back quickly 🙏
Darwin Nunez is this seasons Lukaku/Timo Werner
You make a lot of great points Craig.Unfortunately though I genuinely don’t see solutions like I don’t think it would have been any different had Carvalho played instead of ox or keita started we need a complete overhaul
Surprised you haven’t give VVD an 8
Never mind poor individual performances, the entire set-up seems so fragile. What with the Leicester game performance , and now this horror show, a very nasty pattern is forming. It’s got to be the tactics, applying new players to a tactic that were tailor - made for other players , long since gone. Elliott, Thiago, Ox , Keita cannot do the Klopp pressing game with the high line, either they don’t have the legs or the right style. It suits Nunez, Salah, Diaz and Jota , but 2 of those will not play until February / March. The bench looks pretty thin , with mostly teenagers, and with Gakpo coming in, I hope Liverpool have some cash left over for a couple of top class midfielders. Something needs to change, because Liverpool are looking like a mid table side at best. A long way behind Newcastle and Arsenal football-wise. Some big games coming up. Could be interesting.
Midfielders 😢
The owners have 2 start throwing some real money at it for midfielders, midfielders that can beat players and hit shots on target, atleast make the opposition goalkeeper work
Why does he care about banter from other clubs fans? Seems childish
Manchester United best
Gomez, Keita, Jones, Carvalho, Bajcetic, Phillips, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Elliot, Henderson, Jones, Tsimikas, Konate and Milner need to go as they aren’t good enough.  Van Dijk has never been the same since the injury at Everton.   Robertson, Alexander-Arnold Thiago, Salah, Firmino and Fabinho have more off days than good ones.   Nunez, even though he makes good passes and runs simply can’t score. If he took 6 shots at JFK he’d be alive today!  Klopp needs to stop having so much faith in certain players and demand money for new players and he really needs to come up with new tactics and ways of playing because our system is old and every team knows how to play against us.   Whoever the coaching staff are who analyse the post-match video aren’t doing their job, as we keep making the same mistakes over and over again but are told the club are working on it during training.   FSG please sell up and go because in the modern game we desperately need mega rich owners who will splash the cash to compete with the likes of City, Chelsea, Newcastle, Arsenal and Utd. Unless there’s MAJOR changes very soon this club can kiss goodbye to winning anything.
Sounds like im being shouted at 💀
Gakpo is now thinking WTF, taxi for one to Manchester
United are best
Nunez worse than Werner 😂😂😂
Put Ramsey right back, put Trent in midfield… or or or purchase a fg whole midfield..the engine has stalled. It should have been replaced when we won the PL .
Elliott deserved a shout out for being rubbish today. Way more rubbish than Ox.
Nothing constructive ... just ranting.
Bloody awful performance again. Midfield not protecting the defence at all not enough legs and giving the ball away too easily. We’ve all been talking about hendo but Fabs has been fucking awful along with Harvey and Thiago and Naby. Not one of them has performed
Genuine question Craig - Why would Jude come to LFC? They're falling apart and does he really want to come to this team and what...? Be the change? But not having the backing? Do you genuinely think he will come to liverpool when it's clear there are more issues than just the one spot he can fill and no backing to do it?
Give me a fucking break! Klopp is a bootlick and the club won't spend without a protest. We're hearing all of these midfield options NOW. WHERE THE FUCK WAS THIS ATTENTION in the SUMMER??!!! If Klopp is too stubborn, then he can go.
Wish the world cup was still on frankly.  I was enjoying that thoroughly.  Now we must endure this shit show , which neither the manager nor the owners are prepared to fix . Managers  & owners come and go but it is we the fans who suffer . Honestly I'm quite happy for klopp to go , if he continues to be a yes man & insult pur collective intelligence then I'm happy if he's shown the door   I'm sick of the lies . No reinvention.  Nothing but Dross !
Can't argue with anything you've said....totally spot on!
the only midfielder with legs we have you want out of the club naby lad
What does harvey Elliot brings to the midfield????
Craig calls a spade a spade. Fair play to him. One of the more neutral football supporters.
Playing Elliot in midfield is footballing suicide!!!
Cry more
Who needs  a midfielder!?  F....n hell.  We need players and new owners!!!!!
If I was Bellingham I wouldn’t be going anywhere near this team, unless he has it in writing FSG are going to spend another 300mil on top of what he himself would cost
I still back klopp no matter what, but I agree with your frustration and criticisms. We absolutely must seriously strengthen right now.
Wtf happened to Liverpool and Wtf happened with Klopp. It's not fatigue anymore, it's burned out at this stage.
I'm sorry but the second was Elliott fault who let it role past him
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Damn straight up facts. " Man up and make the changes you are paid to make."   Personally I think Henderson ,thiago, Alex all need to become bench players or  leave .  Fabinho for me is as good as the players around him . He imo can still become our cdm if he gets 2 solid midfielders around him.  The rest have to go period.
Liverpool need new midfielders, new defenders,new owners and maybe a new manager
Do you guys still think 🤔 they can catch arsenal. Like what you're players were saying
You can't play the klopp system if you can't run elliott fabinho and thiago can't run
How the hell are we gonna get Jude in summer at this rate?
Terrible
100000000% right man I agree I’m going mad 😡 can’t even begin to talk about it
i thought this guy gave up youtube last year? what happened? now he is a fake itk? lol
Darwin Nuniez = Andy Carroll
Henderson - 13 starts, 9 wins, 2 draws, 2 losses* Elliott - 17 starts 9 wins, 2 draws, 6 losses* *one out of 2 losses for Henderson is when Elliot played RCM. All 6 losses are when Elliot plays a RCM
Klop a smile when liver pool loos
And another point why in the hell cant Nunez ever stay onside??? So frustrating to see at such a high level 🤬
Salah couldn’t manage a shot on target or May he just one he made. He was missing!!
Well done Brentford, LFC were not at it today.  But  same oh, same oh, from Liverpool, poor 1st half and too we're too heavy reliant on our three forwards. Brentford played 3-5- 2, allowing a wall in midfeild against our three midfeild players and then surounded our front three players or packed out the 18yrd box.  Brentford did the SAME corner time and time again and we didn't learn. We cann't counter attack for Love or money. But Brentford could  counter attacked us, we didn't learn.   Konte had two chances to knock the ball out of play before the 3rd goal.  Poor from the lads tonight.
2 midfielders required this January window ..... otherwise we can say goodbye to champions league football next season .... the clubs value is decreasing every game , hope FSG realise this ... but Klopp has to take the most responsibility for his stubborn denial about his current players
Gakpo will save the day
Can’t rely on faes again😂 Gakpo probably regretting his decision already
One word comes to mind!  Disgrace.
Klopp will be the downfall of liverpool.
Absolute shite, no more excuses,  these players are done, not good enough and don't look like they care. I'm sick to the stomach at looking at it
Jude is not coming
why cry when you can grin
That is were Calvin Ramsay comes in he can take on players and cross the ball
The decision making throughout the game from our players was pure crap at times it was completely embarrassing….. they deserve to not get on the coach back to Liverpool they should all get the train after that performance 🤬🤬🤬
We have Darwin doing his best and getting no service whatsoever
I honestly don’t see how this is a surprise, man for man the team is shocking apart from Allison, none of them would get anywhere near a world 11, giving Salah a new contract and letting Mane go was the worst decision by any Liverpool manager since letting Anelka go, europa league ear we come
It's alright lads, get back to your million pound mansions for a nice sauna with your fit missus's and playing with your little dog , listening to the ch- ching of another six figures landing in your account while we drown in the days of painful disappointment and embarrassment. Where's your fucking spirit..
your tears are sweet craig
Loserpool is finished
Someone needs to explain to me why Elliot is some huge talent who is going to be a star. What does he do well? Keita clearly offered way more. Leaving the club or not he should have started and needs to start over Elliot next match.
A long time mi tell uno say klop no good
Wouldn't go that far need a clear out and fresh talent In mid field .
Surprisingly keitha had a good game only one pushing trying something
Bruh KLOPP must go to the fu owners and stop fucking around!! just go nad say it CLEARLY that we need new players not only in the summer but now we got Gakpo yea but we need at least 1 midfielder now and one in the summer ! or 1 new now and 2 in the summer !! we need like 2/3 more new players ! Fabio Carvalho like why you not play this man??! another why Klopp not to try Arnold move in to midfield ? he clearly have problems in deffensive game !! Sad but we may witness Klopp slowly fire away... as a Liverpool manager.... this is not the first season Live play shambless under Klopp... we have only like really good 3 seasons under him other seasons was decent or bad ;)
What happened to your watchalongs bro?
Klopp needs to stop telling us he can't spend cause of budget or because we ask who next it's not about we just want him to spend for no reason we are in need of a midfield renewal I'm so sick of his Sh!t  Ruined my birthday had a good day then this crap football 🙄
Wish he would stop putting Harvey in mid. Bottlers
Honestly embarrassing klop needs to go away this isn't gonna work and him being ignorant of the massive problem in the midfield
to be fair... Fabio Carvalho is not good enough either. if you ask me who the better player is between Elliott and Carvalho, I'll say Elliott all day and even he isn't good enough for Liverpool at the minute and no one will convince me Carvalho is better. You talk about Konate being bullied. Carvalho is so physically weak, Ben Mee eats him alive in every 1v1 challenge!
Stop abusing the fat lad...
I'm fucking tired of klopp and liverpool man, absolutely shit.  Maybe we need to lose 3 more for klopp to realize that his formation is shit.  Nunez makes me mad man
Nunez doesn't only need to learn how to score shots "i don't care how fast he is" Ohhh and one more thing he should also need to learn how to be ONSIDE!!!!!!!
BUT WHERE IS FAYES 😆😆
Salah offers next to nothing and gets paid £350k a week. Football has become a joke.
Life depends on acknowledging mistakes and correcting them for development. This is what we find with most of the major teams, such as Real Madrid, Barca, Man City and Bayern, while Klopp continues to rely on the same players for 5 consecutive seasons, despite the presence of a midfield problem that is clear to everyone except Klopp.
If Klopp dares making up some excuse again for not signing a midfielder I want him out of the club.  He’s a puppet, a yes man.  Stand up and get us all what we not only want, but deserve.
I give up on Nunez. I've given him the benefit of the doubt until now but he's not going to deliver.
Imagine wha cody thinks
Seen them comments on twitch  fuck the haters Craig  there not worth it ynwa
Liverpool can't compete with Brentford... You have the best team in the world and you put in the best striker on the market. No matter what it costs, you just do it. "Brentford  won't like it, nobody will like it, but you know the answer.
Man. Gakpo didn’t get you a win?
It’s time for Kloop to go
The ''shot'' that darwin hit closer to the cornerflag than the goal was a pass.. no way in hell that was a shot
Sad we lose but it is good though.This will make klopp realise that we need new midfielders and force him to buy.
Klopp needs to wake up and heads need to roll in that locker room, absolute embarrassment.
We're all enjoying the tears brother, keep them coming.
The man speaking facts
No getting away with the fact we were simply awful and Brentford deserved all 3 points
Spot on about carvalio
Gakpo is not our answer
A load of crap and this is why Bellingham won’t come to Liverpool
We need to buy midfielders asap or we wont get top 4
Thomas Tuchel now, if he's he is available
Love Elliot but he's really not good enough to be in the starting 11, Keita should have started today
Klopp will probably blame the January weather rather than the players and himself.
I'd pay someone if they took Curtis Jones off us at this point. Offers nothing.
The criticism of Klopp is a disgrace.   Yes, none of us are happy in the moment. Yet still, now is the time to back our manager and team up to the hilt. When they need it the most.   Jurgen is the only Liverpool manager to win every trophy available.   We have encountered a multitude of problems this season.   And rest assured Jurgen will turn it around like he always does.
Everyone was clueless today, it was funny and frustrating at the same time
I was surprised to see Jones being introduced and overlooking Carvalho.
The problem for me it's not Klopp, we don't have players. All I can see is a team which gave all their best for more than 3 seasons on top level especially last season on each finals and we haven't reinforced especially in the midfield. You can't win a football match without a good midfield. Until we buy 2 qualified midfielders, we will suffer.
Thomas Tuchel now, if he's available
Thomas Tuchel now, if he's available
Klopp at times can piss me off .ynwa
Im loving it
My heart is crying for Calvin Ramsay
Fucking joke that's all I can say.
Thomas Tuchel now, if he is available
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Terrible performance again lack of ideas. They look stale there's something wrong.  Maybe klopps time is up
The bees stung the bin dippers
Fabinho is frustrating
The sooner and better this season ends the better this team including Klopp don't deserve our support this season giving us that s****
For the first time I 100% agree with you
I don't see why we need to sign a midfielder in January. I can't see how we can improve on that midfield though. No no no. They're absolutely marvelous sure
Absolute disgrace of a performance and Klopp needs to hang his head in shame!!!!!
I don’t even blame salah he was forced out wide
Thanks btw Craig you couldn't have said it better
brentford and brighton are picking results on the bigger teams
Get Elliot out of that midfield for starters.
Nice to find a fan channel calling it as it is and being honest, rather than avoiding all the difficult questions to maintain their club access.
Man bun fc 🤣
We played better in the second half and Brentford is a great team
We were dismal I was screaming at the screen, no communication, no desire, not drive and why was cavaliho doing and Nunez was a no where near goal and salah was a ghost today we really need a revamp asap
Klopp deserves to be sacked. His stubborness in signing midfielders has cost us every year since 19/20. He put Salah back to hogging the touchline. What are his tactics exactly? Clueless.
What the fuck what has happened to the team who won the premier league what shit performance
Not so cocky now, are ya? 😂
Liverpool need a clear out and start again as Jamie carragher says it's a ageing team that's ran it's course
Just conceded an offside goal from a set piece and then after the goal was cancelled they conceded another set piece goal Elliot jumping over the ball and doing things unnecessary
Stephen Nightingale
What can klopp do really. The passion, desire everything has gone from the whole team. He aint backed enough and we have fuck alll to bring off the bench. Defence is shite too
Here before the Mancs troll in the comment section, at least we didn't lose 4-0 to Brentford unlike you lot.🤣
Klopp needs to change his stubborn philosophy very quickly and bring in a midfielder or 2 because it's no longer working.
man we need at least 2 midfielders nd 1 defender at least and gapko or firmino should start bench Darwin .🥺💔
We need to start keita from now on we had some life in the midfield when he came on.
An absolute failure of an institution we are. We are finished, done. This ownership has ruined the club for good. Klopp has lost the plot. And we will never be competitive for years again under this ownership. This season is the beginning of the end if big changes arent made on and off the pitch. Oh and jude isn’t coming
Well done Brentford
I can't defend this fraud anymore sack klopp I've had enough we need to go on strike fsg out
I dont care what anyone saying nunez is overrated....how many fucking assist he miss salah could be playmaker already of the season
We have to sign nunes and caicedo in jan. the midfield is an utter shambles
Can't blame klopp for the players preforming disgracefully.
Liverpool fans need to pipe down and except the fact that they aren’t a good team 😂😂😂😂
The worst game since away in Napoli
yes we need gakpo
😠 😡 👿 😤 🤬 😠 😡 👿 😤 🤬  😡
Wow good help u need at new stricker
😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
First
LOL
Nice
