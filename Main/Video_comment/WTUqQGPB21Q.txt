peak year of game
This were Times..... Now the Haloween Event is soo seit
Seeing this 4 years later is something
Revenant one of the most iconic memes of me playing the game since season five. Fav cringe simulacrum is still being shown!?
HE IS BACK
No matter what game, the Halloween events are always th most fun
When will this be again? train was so many times. This event made me play nonstop
I love revenant
2022 anyone?
Revenant need ultimate like this shadow form only for him. It will be cool and usefull.
0:00 - 0:12 0:30 - 0:48
We got clicked bated by ea
Ayo this in my recommended after the announcement of the upcoming Halloween event
0:54 se ve bien la skin de bloodhund
WHOS READY FOR THE SHADOWS FOR THE THIRD TIME
Respawn is stuck making Apex content to satisfy EA, But deep down, they haven’t truly let Titanfall go, even if it feels like it, and this event proves that.
Fortnite just copied this
Please bring the skins back
1:11 we need this finisher
I hate how I played during both Christmas and Halloween events but I never went on during or after those events😩🤦
THE BEST EVENT EVER NO WORDS IT HAVE WALL RUNNING! 😆😆😆😆❤️❤️❤️❤️
2019 Fight or Fright was WAY better than 2020 Fight or Fright. Hopefully 2021 improves.
Me who never survived as a legends in season 3: Haha, dope
Hope they bring this back
Who watches this in 2021 when revs heirloom is out? Who’s hyped for next holloween event? I’m def hyped for I’m ready for this again
revenant killing revenant  what a sight to see
Hopefully this was a test to see how a wallrunning legend could work. I hope we get Jack Cooper or maybe Gates.
Yo loba need this buff 0:39
all the versions of revenant: yayay it’s our time to shine! :D
If you return this gamemode instead of shadowfall , i will delete game for good
I love the first one soooo scary
still waiting for: ''all dressed up and nowhere to go''
Anyone else hear Revenant going rattle em boys
i wasnt playing during this event yet because i started during the last week or 2 of the Holo-day bash event but it slooks like this was really fun
0:46 DID I JUST HEARD AN ANVIL
We need the same bracelet animation for loba in the live server please !
声が良い......
Let's see if you all can do it all again
Please bring this back😩😩😩😭
Yoooo I missed out last Halloween! 😔 hopefully it comes back!🙏
Nobody: Rev: *Finishes himself*
Shadow revenant destroys revenant
I never seen revenant kill himself before and revenant is my favorite legend
caustic main: tries to use gas traps to contain shadow me in bunker me a Titanfall veteran: wallruns over head and picks him and his teammates off one by one
So were aren’t going to talk about the dead grunt... no. Okay 0:19
0:20 that is a IMC soldier. If you don’t know what it is search up IMC grunt
IT IS OUR TIME TO RISE PILOTS
Apex players:    Run around like octane and jump but can't wall run.  Titan fall 2 veterans: Wall run everywhere kill everyone and win every match.
0:53 I NEED THAT I REGRET NOT GETTING IT
Running on walls feels like cod
fix foot step audio or we riot dislike cuz caustic
Not gonna lie I think the first fight or flight is better than the second one
Even months after the event how is nobody talking about demonic Loba being possesd by Revenant???
Great there's two Revenants?  As if there wasn't any world they couldn't live on?
Tf2 players: THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE
i think imma thorw up
trash last year was better, solo is scary and fun
trash last year was better, solo is scary and fun
trash last year was better, solo is scary and fun
Apex should make a Episode Like Anime or talking Tom and friend lol
Those zombie grunts and prowlers tho
Holy fuck
Revenant is Revenant.
All dressed up and nowhere to go 🥺
Petition to bring back the trophy hunter caustic skin
My favorite time of the year
It’s only been a month and I miss it
All dressed up and nowhere to go. Maybe make some friends
Who else quit fortnite for this game
Fix you bs money hungry battlepass
Bruh I seriously forgot about apex legends the whole month
Бля, когда вы перестанете делать контент для детей? Почему эта игра стала выглядеть как 10+ максимум, раньше вообще не парились, ревенант убивает, все для мужиков, режим с тенями прикольно-страшный, а это дичь для детей, ну просто становитесь как фортнайт, какого фига апекс?Давайте вернёмся к те 18+ категории игры, не надо думать , что дети в приоритете, как большое комьюнити, вот просто не надо. А этот режим помойка, просто ничтожество по сравнению с прошлогодним этим же режимом
Respawn, please, in face of all comunity, do the shadowfall gamemode (like last year) in worlds edge after night
Can we please get a black guy on the game!
What haunts you most is death
The end event :)
Ahhhh and the event ended:(
Jesus😱
Fortnite fucking did pretty much the exact same event, and copied fucking Apex again. Could Fortnite seriously not come up with an original event. Seriously. Apex Legends>Fortnite
Revenant killed Loba's Dad for 10 Million Apex Coins! And Runs a Halloween Event every year! Probably the highest paid legend.
nah I don't think I can survive this one cuz this is my first one
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that you have to pay $60 if you want 1 wraith skin
Wraith still has that goofy party city skin huh?
Is no-one gunna talk about how smooth the transitions are?!
Ворв
Shadow Wattson: Think of this as a permanent black out. 🌚  Revenant: Look into my eyes, I want to remember this.... 🌚   Shadow Wattson: Mmmm.... 😚   Everyone in match: Our abilities are silenced!   Mirage: Well, this is one way to make memories.... 😓
Apex makes something cool  Fortnite: WRITE THAT DOWN WRITE THAT DOWN
Nobody: Titanfall players as shadows: *teleports behind you* nothing personal kid
"Shadows can wallrun"  Me a titanfall legend: wallrunning? I haven't done that in years,
This game mode is really bad sorry 1/10
The challenge rewards were so much better last year.
Were back and more deadlier
if you repeated some skins in the store, you should rotate them all at least twice. Airship Assassin Back Please
Lol when an event that literally cut 7 days from a season  doesn't track for regular challenges... Sounds like someone wants people to either pick and choose, or spend more than a tolerable amount of time on apex. I choose my sanity not to play your games.
Fucking expensive...
I love this event and looking for it for a long time
I dont know why,but the shadowfall event in 2019 was way better than this
Apex just don’t take the path fortnite took then u will be way better than fortnite
Why can't mirage use his decoy to revive, I mean it will be op tho
so much hype around a mode that was already garbage last year...
I got the cowboy mirage skin 2 days ago now im happy only skin i wanted fron diz event.
GET RID OF CROSS PLAY.. YOUR GAME LAGS AND GLITCHES EVERY MATCH. ITS UNPLAYABLE
This shit is lazy
De todos o melhor evento do Apex disparado, a maioria eu mal chego na metade mas os dois do Halloween são excelentes, eu completei e continuo jogando. Esse evento devia continuar como modo definitivo e contar as kills de player x player e missões do passe, as vezes cansa só jogar trio/duo ou ranked.
e apex te estan copiando el evento de hallowen fornite
i dont think many people realises it, but this seems like a teaser for  an upcoming war  between revenants
What a shame that it's not like the last one. This years event blows the big wee wee. It was way more fun being chased by a bunch of shadows and knowing that people will try and kill you too. This year once your squad dies its game over.  Pretty wank tbh. There's no enjoyment out of this years event as well as unlocks.  :'(
I LOVE revenants voice 😅😳
Last fright or fight was better but still injoying the mode even if it was easy to get the badges and items...
Game is still trash until you add solo mode..
the same shit as last year=)))
Halloween,R-301,please！！
The pet Prowler is so stupid it's one big dumb animal it mostly stands around and does really help
Yo where tf is titanfall 3 I mean this is cool and all I like apex it’s a good battle royale but like I’m waiting I’ve been waiting for 4 years
Can someone tell me what shadow rev was saying
heeeey why did they shorten the days of the battle pass ?. Some of us still have levels to complete😑😑
I have a good idea for a legend he will be able to summon those lions from titan fall 2 and also will be able to summon a flying bird that grips on to the enemy and tears them to pieces
Does revanent get a new finisher that punches or am I wrong
APEX LET ME SWITCH MY ACCOUNT PROGRESS TO PC FROM PS4 plzplzplzplz
Better than Fortnites rip off
This is a lie 0:37 her bracelet does not work that fast.
Nobody:  Fortnite kids: OmG tHeY cOpiEd ThE gAmEmOdE fRoM fOrTniTe!1!1!1
Plz don’t add cars that’s all I’m asking for
fix yall dam servers they trash asf i lagg out every game now and the ping too nasty im uninstalling NOW WORST GAME  OUT
Bring back old Fight or Fright event not this Battle Royal version when u can end match just cus ur team lost that sucks...
EA sucks doing apex legends they have 0 iq in there head

This might sound dumb but I think there should be split screen on apex..
ESPECTACULAAAAR GOOOOOLAZOOOOO

Return naruto run animation for wraith😞
I hope Pathfinder eventually gets a buff that lets him cut down his ziplines.
I wish I could have an heirloom
SA BEUG ON PEUX PAS S INVITER

Caustic story trailer should be soon😊
Dang they released the og skin butvit is what it is
Fixt euer scheiß matchmaking und nehmt das crossplay raus eure server packen es nicht es laggt bei jedem beschissenen fight es ist lächerlich ich geh solo in trios meine mates lvl82 und lvl34 chapion squad 3x lvl500 2 doppel preds und einen doppel meister wollt ihr mich verarschen? Was soll das? Achja und fixt den bloodhound bug im scan das teils gegner nicht gezeigt werden
Apex Legend What do you think about degenerating in the training phase of each open character?
Anyone else anxiously waiting for the season 7 launch trailer?
Will you do cross progress please
What is wrong with you I didn't even have teammates and you still gave me a penalty
I stopped playing after season 5 but I came back to the game today and I'll just say it's so fun to be back 😂👍🏻
I’m octane for Halloween
I LOVE APEX LEGENDS
Add jack copper back for apex season 7 please there’s so much potential in him
建物入ったら汁男優みたいな勢いで襲ってくる屍ども
#apexparanintendo
Starting to get tired of this shit game. When Cyberpunk is out this will be  deleted.
I have no real problem with this game, but I hate it solely because its not titanfall 3
Rev: darkness finally has it’s day  Shadow rev: that’s fax (snaps neck)
Please fix invalid token error or tell us how we can fix it ourself
I want to play but I don’t have anything to play on
Please release apex on switch
I love apex is like my favorite game
One question when will Apex come to Nintendo switch
When is this game coming to steam
and no-one noticed the imc grunt in the loot bin
Soo if the apex games gives u access to fuckin airstrikess..WHY TF ISNT EVERYBODY USING IT..ik its for idk diversity or whatever but realistically dont make so sense😂 especially with mirage like wtf
last fof was bettet
Just played this game mode and i must say im so glad i picked apex as my main multiplayer game
I dont like all new operators
I'm so lagging please fix
They absolutely ruined it.  The first shadowfall was the best.  I refuse to pay anything but duos now on apex
Kinda sad that I can't play the zombie once my team dies. Any chance for a version that is like the original? I just wanna go around as zombie honestly, that's why I play zombie modes.
So the point is:..... WRAITH MAIN CHARGEE!!!!!
captain marvel
Me waiting, waiting for Apex on switch
Hakers
Arreglen sun malditos machtmaking solo aparecen hacer
Wanted the blood hound skins o bad but gotta pay 60 dollars what a waste
Just heard Fortnite copied Fight or Fright with the Shadow concept. Whatcha gonna do about that, EA?
How aboute when the team is dead they can still fight as monsters
Its been 6-7 months since I last played it
I'm not going to lie I liked the other game mode of the shadows more but the mode is also good, I hope they put the other one
Ay fortnite really just stole this event 2 days ago😔
Do you have an official release date for apex mobile? I want to make sure I don’t miss it so o can play with my brother as soon as possible. Thanks! 👍
Apex for switch
Can u plz fix the lag
I’m honestly disappointed in this entire event. Firstly Apex devoted almost all of their time and effort to create skins for a random event just before Halloween (that was totally unjustified and a money grabbing ploy) , which mind you had multiple NEW legendary skins and epics, even a heirloom was given to that lacklustre event, even with Halloween coming up, even with a popular game mode (that was already in the game), but they opted to go with healing zones........ (what ever happened to creative game modes, like one for all, imagine a full squad of mirages or Wattsons, what about no cool downs??? A game mode with healing zones and no other methods of healing was their best option of course).    Secondly what ever happened to exclusivity, huh? Not only do they bring back all the legendary skins from LAST year but they bloody hell include them in a bundle with the re-textured skins. This entire event would have left less of a sour taste in my mouth if they had just had the re-textured skins available. I personally have the bloodhound skin from last year and I enjoyed the fact that there was a certain number of people out there with this skin, it WAS rare.    And thirdly I hate the new Revenant game mode. I plan and straight out hate it....... last year it was the dead vs the living, this year it’s you vs your team and every other team. I can’t count the amount of times it’s either takin to long to die, become a zombie and attempt to reach my BOT like team or my team dives head first into third party’s (which we end up third partied ourselves, WITHOUT fail). Honestly I shouldn’t have to point this out but some tips that could make the experience better is  - have an option to keep being a zombie, a solo zombie, so if your team dies you can continue to play (making it harder on the 4K an 20 kill badges because we all know they have a hard time against people who can’t even get a fu**ing 2k badge....That’s me if you can’t tell) - have the gold knock down with a gold backpack passive, so you come back with at least a chance, the amount of times I’ve come back and instantly gone down again because my lack of health is just stupid.  - and remove the increased resurrect time, it’s so much harder as a zombie against a full living squad, to then after my 5 death waiting more then 15 seconds is ridiculous, I’ve had fights last less then that. - or an option when your down to turn into a zombie? So instead of waiting for some one to finish the job or dying then waiting to come back, all the while your whole team dies    Please Respawn pick up ur SH*T, you’ve done better........
Ruined the gamemode smh
A apex unban me plz
Yo respawn imma big fan i just wanted to say i found your easter egg or whatever it is about titan fall2 were if u dont skip subtitles u find jack cooper helmet blinks so i guess that means bt is alive right
Ima make a stand gold ar should have a bruiser not a 1 to 2 x scope who with me !
Tbh disappointed it's not the same mode as last year, this mode is kinda lame.

Apex runs 10 times better than Warzone so I’ll be playing this instead of Verdansk.
Has anybody realised Loba's tactical ( 0:37 ) when she teleports, the animation is shorter
Shadowfall better , if you can , can you do it for few days pls, i really wanna to see best game mode ever
Traaaaaaaash return shadowfall
Can we get a revenant buff where if you become a shadow through his totem we can wall run 😅 The feeling was greeeeeeat
Titanfall veteran heart i can wall run good but I just need guns like a spit fire and a wing man and electric smoke grenades and and a holopilot
I think this is bad mode, old version the best, this is shadowroyalle bullshit, just return shadowfall
Anyone else think shadowfall was better than shadow royal?
Had a whole year to come up with new skin designs but devs to lazy to make new ones so here a recolor of old skin i can see this happening on the Christmas event too
MHHHH I CAN SMELL SOME TITANFALL 3 THAWING  WITH THAT WALL RUN 🥴
I know this is early but if this event has returned then my one christmas wish would be that The winter express returns on December please make that happen

Best LTM yet. I’m having so much fun with it. And I’m not too crazy over the other LTM’s (except for Armed and Dangerous). But this one is amazing!
Can we get a reconnect for the new mode pls?
Thanks a fuk ton for shortening everything cuz now I can't finish my treasure packs
Is normal that the win or kills in this new Mode not count to character cart stats?
yeeeeeees
WOOOO. A RECYCLED EVENT. LETS GO.
WALL RUN. TITAN FALL PLAYERS LET'S GO
1 year after event better
Lame and broken.  Kills counted on stats last year.  This year they don't.   Pointless waste of time.  Waited all year for this major disappointment.
Skin bundles are overpriced and only want two separate ones
Yeah but where are the f'ing servers??!!
Who still plays this game?
Can you make peacekeeper shot gun drop in the map again plz
interesting why still didnt add this mode for game? today  is 23 october already
Fortnite literally copied apex

:(
Trash

Im geting TitanFall  flash backs,   🙄

heres a theory,since the last october fight or fright was cannon,what if when ur teammates die in that world and go back to their world(with worlds edge) and the shadows of the fallen teammates from the rev-controlled world are defending you in their place to protect the alive teammates from revenant of that world. as to what they are doing there and what their secret mission is is still unknown,maybe well find out in season 7....?
Hey apex you know the seminal glitch I tried to do it I didn’t want to actually do it but somewhat there was either lag or the sentinel was still kinda not fixed
Call of duty:zombie royal  Fortnite:let’s copy call of duty fortinmares  Apex:let’s copy fortnites idea to copy call of duty
I feel like the wraith familiar face could have had the old costume then phased away and came back with the new costume
Any idea why the event name is the same as the one in Pokémon Masters? Note that their event started a week ago.
Revenant narrating this was perfect, they needed to make his shadow skin an heirloom skin it would be perfect
I’m sorry but WHO ELSE THOUGHT THAT BLOODHOUND SKIN WAS AMAZING
That gameplay is really horrible and I'm going to tell you why. One begins as a normal battle squad, when a member of the squad dies, recharges as a shadow just to support their team and when the whole squad dies, you can't play anymore, so don't be stingy, at least let us play the whole game. leaving like shadows. Besides, if I am going to support my squad, the shadow hits very little and those of the first squad kill us with 1 shot.  not like before that if you hit him you would take away almost everything and kill him. But it disgusts me, at least let us play the whole game as a shadow because if they kill us the first time then we can no longer play as shadows or as a normal squad. Not like Fortnite that does release new and quality content. Knowing you so much money that you have and are not capable of doing something good. I play apex from the first day it came out and the truth is that it is boring me that it is the same every day, the same as 3-person or 2-person games and that's it. no good, unrecycled game modes or new character skins, just recolors there #APEXBORING
Yo respawn has been vomiting out content, good for then💯🤟🏼
This is so dumb.  IF YOU ARE GOING TO BRING A SPIN-OFF OF THE OLD FIGHT OR FRIGHT, BRING IN THE OLD VERSION TOO.  ESPECIALLY FOR PLAYERS WHO DIDN’T EXPERIENCE IT!!!
Why the hell would you make the OG skins back to the shop
You completly ruined a perfect game mode, it was better and more scary on solo and with the objective to escape
Um these are titanfall flash backs, am I right?
Bru thr shadows are so cool please keep this for next year
I'm playing rigjt now and I personally don't like staying alive if my team is alive I liked the one ltm were would infinitly spawn
Looks like Loba's Bracelet transition is much faster
Trash game
What a garbage event,can't even buy skins individually 🤣🤣
Why is the wraith skin soo bad?😬
*THIS EVENT IS TOTAL CRAP... PREVIOUS HALLOWEEN EVENT WAS 100% BETTER...*
ThEy cOPieD FoRTniGhtmAres
Ive been playing too much titanfall that i dont realize... WALL RUN
LET ME IN >:D
I hope a crypto heirloom comes with it
Respawn you should’ve kept shadowfall cause shadow royal is lame the zombies are to easy to kill and melee is to weak last year everyone was solo and you always respawn after death then at the end you have a alot of zombies trying to stop you from reaching the ship man it was much better i got exited when i first heard this was coming back but when i played it this was a disappointment make some improvements or switch it back to shadowfall before halloween is over cause i know for a fact everyone want the old shadowfall back
When apex releases the event and you have saved up enough crafting metals to get that bloodhound skin you have always wanted EA: give me your money
menos zueiro
Gotta pay $40 just to buy the one caustic skin... big scam
Finally Titanfall was the fucking best
Pls extend just for a whole week? Away from home for this whole period...
Best vids ever
So is our rev the kind of the shadow dimension?
Bro they used all the same skins from last year just changed the color sad
Bruh  Just make tf3 already, it’s obvious you guys want to do it
New rev finisher tho?
Honestly this event is cool and all, but if feels kinda lazy. Its just the same skins with recolors and a gamemode with just a few small changes. Ye I know its quality of life changes, but I wish respawn could have tried to do something a little bit more new, just sayin.
*_Like this, and post this on Apex Legends Ins. And Twitter, soo Apex can notice:Revenant's normal revive animation should be the Revive Animation Shadows do to their Teammates, and Revenant's Death Totem should turn the Player who use it into a Real Shadow, With Time._*
Lobas ring works well in these vids..
The first one was more fun!
I was going to buy a skin for life line but I remember that the Halloween event it was coming an I save my blue cristal and know I saw that you need real money to buy the skins.  :(

And for the wrongdoers there will be no helpers.(72)}Truthful Allah the Great [Al-Ma’eda] 5:72 {لقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْمَسِيحُ ابْنُ مريم وَقَالَ الْمَسِيحُ يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ ربّي وَربّكم إِنَّهُ مَنْ يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الجنّة وَمَأْوَاهُ النّار وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنصَارٍ} صدق الله العظيم [المائدة:72].  As that the Awaited Imam Mahdi invites all the humans to what invited you to it Allah’s messenger the Messiah Jesus son of Mary -prayer of forgiveness and peace be upon him:{..worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Surely whoever associates (others) with Allah, Allah has forbidden to him the Garden and his abode is the Fire. And for the wrongdoers there will be no helpers.}Truthful Allah the Great [Al-Ma’eda] 5:72 {اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ ربّي وَربّكم إِنَّهُ مَنْ يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الجنّة وَمَأْوَاهُ النّار وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنصَارٍ} صدق الله العظيم [المائدة:72].  As well the Awaited Mahdi invites all the humans to what invited you to it Allah’s messenger Mohammad prayer of forgiveness and peace be upon him, and I say what Allah commanded him to say it to the humans: {..worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Surely whoever associates (others) with Allah, Allah has forbidden to him the Garden and his abode is the Fire. And for the wrongdoers there will be no helpers.}Truthful Allah the Great. {اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ ربّي وَربّكم إِنَّهُ مَنْ يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الجنّة وَمَأْوَاهُ النّار وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنصَارٍ}صدق الله العظيم.   And I invite you all the humans to what invited them to it Allah’s messenger Moses and Aaron prayer of forgiveness and peace be upon them: {..worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Surely whoever associates (others) with Allah, Allah has forbidden to him the Garden and his abode is the Fire. And for the wrongdoers there will be no helpers.}Truthful Allah the Great. {اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ ربّي وَربّكم إِنَّهُ مَنْ يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الجنّة وَمَأْوَاهُ النّار وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنصَارٍ}صدق الله العظيم.  And I am the Awaited Mahdi inviting all the humans to what invited them to it all messengers from the first of them to the seal of them my grandfather Mohammad messenger of Allah -prayer of Allah's forgiveness and peace of Allah be upon him and his family, and I say the same word of Allah’s messengers altogether: {..worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Surely whoever associates (others) with Allah, Allah has forbidden to him the Garden and his abode is the Fire. And for the wrongdoers there will be no helpers.}Truthful Allah the Great. {اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ ربّي وَربّكم إِنَّهُ مَنْ يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الجنّة وَمَأْوَاهُ النّار وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنصَارٍ} صدق الله العظيم.  Allah did not make the Awaited Mahdi a new prophet nor did I bring to you a new Book, in fact I invite you with the same invitation of all the prophets and messengers; is they you worship my Lord and your Lord and whoever associated with Allah, his work indeed is vain; and in the Hereafter he is of the losers. And you would never find the Awaited Mahdi apart a measure of hair strand from the invitation of all the prophets and messengers to worshiping Allah Alone with no partner for Him. And Allah the Most High said: {And We sent no messenger before you but We revealed to him that there is no God but Me, so worship Me.}Truthful Allah the Great [Al-Anbya] 21:25 {وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِنْ قَبْلِكَ مِنْ رَسُولٍ إِلَّا نُوحِي إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنَا فَاعْبُدُونِ ( 25 )} صدق الله العظيم [الأنبياء].   O community of Christians , I am warning you in an extreme- mighty punishment from Allah so do not say Allah took a son and you have no knowledge in it nor had your fathers and they did not crucified him, in fact Allah raised his soul to Him and purified his body from whom they disbelieved and they did not touch him with harm so that is (Al-Raqim)the added number to the companions of the cave to be with them from Allah’s wonderful signs to you from yourselves, and Allah will resurrect him so believe him O community of Christians and Muslims — Allah will protect you from the liar messiah (antichrist) who he wants to say that he is the Messiah Jesus and to say that he is Allah Lord of the worlds and was not for the Messiah Jesus son of Mary to say what he has no right, and as he spoke to the people in the cradle he will speak to the people in maturity by the Truth and he would call them to what he called them to it the Awaited Mahdi, surely we utter in one unified speech: No God other than Allah Alone with no partner for him nor a Worshiped else than Him; an equitable word among all the prophets, messengers, Awaited Mahdi and the Messiah Jesus son of Mary forgiveness and peace be upon them, and he will say to you what he said it to whom were before you: {Certainly they disbelieve who say: Allah, He is the Messiah, son of Mary. And the Messiah said: O Children of Israel, serve Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Surely whoever associates (others) with Allah, Allah has forbidden to him the Garden and his abode is the Fire.

Imam Al Mahdi Nasser Muammad 22 - 05 - 2020  ..From khalifa of Allah over the worlds to Xi Jinping president of China 🇨🇳👇🇨🇳💞❤💕🇨🇳👇🇨🇳  Allah’s hidden soldiers are still launching their global war continuing night and day for twenty-four hours without rest, and it does not get weak, surely it is from His hidden soldiers, unseen with the naked eye for its small size, and it's what you call it coronavirus, yet it is not a corona, only has deceived them initially the outer form has similarity with the known viruses that they have previously of which they know, but it’s genes and its behavior is different altogether, but its first name corona as they thought initially is being issued in the entire means of media and by the tongues (languages) of the world; [Corona] although it is completely different than the entire viruses, and only got similar with it formerly initially yet it differed genetically. In fact; by Allah Who there is no God other than Him, the One, the Subduer, indeed it is a living organism broken apart and been split, yet what’s coming next is calamitous, most bitter and a wide spread evil, and the entire physicians of humans will turn their backs (fleeing).  And it is a living organism new for humans and breaking the entire scientific medical physics, and it will indeed make humans’ science about what concerns scientific medical physics (0) zero at the left for the fact they originally do not compass knowledge about it.  But the upcoming strong virus is the most powerful and the strongest impact in chastisement lo and behold they will despair from it, and it is not only at the level of the respiratory system, in fact there is no room for a comparison between covid 19 viruses and the upcoming strong virus — O Xi Jinping president of China — O who claim that they controlled chastisement of Allah Lord of the world, glory be to Him the Exalted most High beyond measure, yet they know that they are indeed liars  I announce to the atheists in china and criminal leaders of humans of their ilk altogether, and the entire unjust mischief makers, — a new species of viruses which is the strong striking virus worst of the viruses and the most impact and the strongest in sabotaging; in fact there is no room for a comparison between it and what you call it covid 19, it is the one that the scientists of medicine will turn their backs in flight from it and the army of physicians of humans would not return back, being defeated from their forefathers then the global health organization would collapse their high structure is being vacant and they could never avail a thing away from you from Allah’s chastisement. In fact, by no means and they could never be able to help you nor help themselves.  Verily, listen, comprehend and understand to what I will say to you: Indeed, there is a Great Leader for these recent viruses you are not of His proportion nor you are equivalent to Him and His tiniest soldiers receive orders directly by revelations from Allah, so they would do what they are commanded from source of operations for the Highest Leader, that is your Most High Lord in the kingdom — reveals directly to His tiny soldiers what to do so they would do what they are commanded and He is with it by words of His absolute-ability — glory be to him, that is Allah Lord of the worlds that you violate His sanctity (denying His existence) — O Xi Jinping the Chinese president who declared war against Allah, His religion, His Quran and the Muslim Chinese openly (in broad) daylight against the Muslims in China and shut-down Allah’s Houses (of worship) in China. In fact, he prohibited the Muslims to even pray in their houses and took Allah’s Book the grand Quran and burned Allah’s Book the grand Quran as transgression and oppression.  You must listen and comprehend what will I say it with Truth: O you the Chinese president Xi Jinping, I swear by Allah the Great, surely you will open houses of Allah while you are of the humiliated-trifle ones also the entire those who wronged themselves that shut-down Allah’s houses (of worship) with the pretense of prevention they will definitely open it and to it they will escape, and we surely truthful, and you surely will know.  Anyway, — O community of best foremost supporters from various regions, let the focus be accomplished exclusively on publishing three explanatory-statements at the first level, the explanatory-statement that we wrote it by its title that follows: (Coronavirus and the decisive explanatory-statement, and it is not a joke..), title of the explanatory-statement has ended. You must know the sure knowledge that there is in it a healing to what’s in the chests, guidance, and mercy for the believers. And peace be upon the messengers, and praise be to Allah Lord of the worlds. .Allah’s servant and His khalifa; the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni  _____________ https://www.mahdialumma.com/showthread.php?p=330364#post330364  29 - Ramadan - 1441 AH 22 - 05 - 2020 AD 12:20 pm (According to the official time of [Mecca] mother of towns) _________ ..From khalifa of Allah over the worlds to Xi Jinping president of China
Please make a way for you to refund you heirloom shards once
^o^!!!
Hi but theres no heirloom but why
I don't comment much on these vids but I gotta say that this mode is dope especially seeing the prowler watching your back
Pa cuando en nintendo switch XD...no enserio espero con ansias que salga en esa plataforma 👍
The bundle are so expensive put them back to crafting ughh 😕
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍
Check my account for awesome Apex content :) would be awesome!
60 Euro für Bloodhound-Skin... Ihr seid die Besten! Einen Spieler weniger....
The prowler as a support unit was cool until it started destroying my shield walls it’s dumb now
Who’s genius idea was it to sell the same skins just as a different color? Bunch of lazy developers
Bring back the old mode it was way better.😔😕
Now this mode it there yayyy you can get 20bom ???
WHERES SOLOS AT!!! WE NEED SOLOS CUZ I DONT WANNA PLAY WITH RANDOMS ANYMORE!!!
So just die right away and I get to play titanfall?
oh god that wallrun is going to break the game  edit: 0:43 did you notice that double jump right there?
Kinda lazy
When are u realising a caustic skin for legend tokens
Titanfall 2 veteran right here..downloading right now to play as a shadow...S4lami is coming
Cmon apex but one legendary skin In one pundel they costs too much
Apex en este evento me sacan del juego y estoy muy molesto porque no es una vez al día, siempre está adentro y me patea y no puedo jugar un juego normal porque me patea. No sé si puedes ayudar a hacer este juego Vien, es uno de los que más me gustan y el único juego que tengo en mi portátil y no lo desinstalé por fornite o perro guardián
Apex in this event they take me out of the game and I am very upset because it is not once a day, it is always in and it kicks me and I cannot play a normal game because it kicks me. I don't know if you can help make this game Vien, it's one of the ones I like the most and the only game I have on my laptop and I didn't uninstall it because of fornite or watch dog
Where is the event? Comw on I can't wait pls pls pls FASSSSTERRRR!!!!!! xD
If I don't turn to a shadow when I die, I'm not attending my funeral
Are we not gonna talk about the IMC grunt zombie?
They keep finding new ways to address Titanfall's existence without making a third game or even giving the second game any attention. This doesn't thrill me, this makes me mad.
The trailers are always amazing
I love how apex gives us leakes for the next season after the new one season 6+7 for example in the season 6 gameplay trailer the guy said *Horizon* which is our new legend for season 7
The shadows are playin cod multiplayer rn
Please make it were you buy the skin separated because I don't want to spend £50 to get the skin I want to get
Change the prices!
Fix your server
Hey apex why the f did you give crypto his own bundle with his Halloween but bloodhound have to have crypto Halloween skins and a prowler skins this is too much for to buy😢
U hav ruined the best ltm gamemode u ever had like why did u have to make it a battle royale gamemode instead of keeping it the same u idiots
Everyone: "Wow fight or fright is back!"  Me, and all veterans: *WALLRUN LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOO*
Wall runs? Oh god, not like the shadows were already OP or anything 🙂
WHY THE MAIN BLOODHOUND PLAYERS HAVE TO BUY CRYPTO SKINS TOO?
Listen I sound like a loser but can someone Please give me a code for 20 dollar gift card I have no money and I really need the mirage skin
Just tried the event. Respawn what a disappointment. There’s nothing but the ltm and overpriced old skin
WHERE'S SHADOWFALL? I played it and ITS EXACTLY LIKE THE MODERN WARFARE ONE WTF i through this was like the 2019 one IT WAS HELLA FUN
シャドウロイヤル、ゾンビ即抜け対策で頑張ってるのは認めるけど・・・これじゃ前回のゾンビの無敵感もないし、弱者が復讐する機会もない。正直言ってこれじゃいつもやってるapexのモードと本筋が変わらない。結局弱いプレイヤーは次のマッチに行くしかなくて、せっかくの無敵のゾンビってのに鎖を付けてる。それに自由に空も飛べない！！！ もちろん色々なものを増やして沢山の人が楽しめると思うけど。僕は昔のシャドウフォールの本筋は変えずに即抜け対策をとって欲しかった・・・
Recycled skins, good job.... utter trash
Shadowfall IS better than shadow royale
Quit ruining something already fun to play
2019  Season 0  Season 1  Season 2 Season 3 2020  1 month of season 3 Season 4 😠😠😠 Season 5  Season 6  2 months of season 7  2021  1 month of season 7  Season 8  Season 9  Season 10  2022  Season 11  Season 12

Masks destroy your brain and nervous system. They are utterly detrimental to your health and well-being. Covid 19 does not exist. Your body is merely responding to the 5G frequency which it is not accustomed to. Look into symptoms of radiation sickness and they mirror one another. Do not wear masks, do not kill yourselves willingly.
Can we just talk about how for the first time someone didn't get killed with one shot from a gun at the end? That pathfinder had more than 1 health.
I love apex
I'd play but I may be banned if a streamer gets killed 😥
its oct 22 and nothing .
Why didn’t it get released yet?
pls peacekeeper come back
why cant i buy the loba skin like why do I have to buy the lifeline skin even tho i dont want it
I hate how they are releasing the Holloween stuff in a pack with the style, blood hound I believe cost 6000 because of this you get the new style as well
reclycling again apex 😕
The skins are just recolors from last year😩
When you load onto apex and it’s not there
How lazy was this new patch lol
They should put a secret somewhere in the firing range where you can activate wall run and double jump to have fun
How late is the event?🙃
When does the update hit
Any one know what time
So after this  is wall running going to be an Olympus thing? or a passive for a new Legend?
What time in British is this coming out?
Ok it’s October 22 why isn’t it a thing
So if we have some of the Halloween skins from last year do we still need to buy them for the characters we already hot?
Shadow meni:dubel jump and wall run  Titanfall veterans : il take your intaer stock  Olso rt his is sooooo cool i whacht it dor 10 hours now
Jesus died for you was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures.  If you confess with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Please repent of your sins and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.
Very cool

WALL RUNNING

Would be cool to have an event for duos or  solo 🤓🕹

Can't believe Fortnite tried to copy this

Apex Legends players will have no idea what hit them...  #WallRunning
Rev getting a new finisher???
apex: this is the new fight or fright event  fortnite: our event
https://skybudshops.com/
Ребята, я пилю крутые и смешные монтажи по Apex, и не только, а на рекламу денег нет) Зацените) Не пожалеете)
Not going to lie but...        Caustic like hates mirage lol
I would suck to throw loba's tactic just to not work. I wonder if they haven't fixed that.
Dont suck this much
Apex pleasee
No update apex
can you buy the skins separately if not RESPAWN YOUR SCAMMERS OR SHOULD I SAY EA
SpookyApex2020.exe soon...
Which game is better?  Apex legends- like Fortnite- comment
Yo apex no idea if you’ll see this but fortnite made a copy of your game mode
cant wait
Who believe that alien exist. If you do  Like this comment.
If you don't like it your barber will mess your next haircut.
U lie respawn is thursday niw in my country u lied to us
There is 0 incentive to ever play this game again
I don’t wanna hate on you apex, but these bundle prices aren’t fair, it all comes to 270 and last year it was 150 with an heirloom. I know you get reskins but doesn’t that mean you’re just using old content and recoloring it and charging us 120 dollars more?
https://youtu.be/ZgPBs9sTbjk
Everyone is talking about the wall running meanwhile I’m here hoping there is a caustic full body tracker cus he don’t have one
The event is cool and all but you shouldn’t be punished for wanting to be a shadow .  You rely on your team mate to stay alive .  So if you and another team mate die then you have to stay with the one that is alive   Please bring the solo one back
restart titanfall make it much better
just class,re-stamping from a light tone to a dark tone
0:28 what’s with the angle the bullets are coming out of that barrel
“..Not my first dance with death..”
Its So CRAZY  How Wraiths Voice Is The Same Actor From The Amazon Prime Show "The Boys"  So Freaking Cool!!
Use revenant ultimate to disguise as shadows
POV you’re crying tears of joy because the wall running
I'm almost positive Warzone just released something nearly identical in terms of gameplay, Zombie Royale.
When is this game coming in Nintendo
Lets goo only have to wait 4 Hours in the Queue !
Apex: brings Halloween event back  9 year olds be like u copied fortnite
Can you be able to buy the skin separately please
Damn 1k fortnite kids came to dislike the video. There may be some in the comments, here you'll need this 🔫.
https://youtu.be/WWEaLopsokk
Man this looks so cool. Too bad I can't enjoy it cause your servers are garbage with extreme amounts of ping and packet loss.
I just want to play apex
Is this like the zm cod warzone?
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU YA'LL DO THE EVENT WAS 20 DAYS YESTERDAY THEN THIS DAY 13 DAYS LEFT WTF
Руские есть
Apex <<<<< fornite
Anyone know what time it comes out? 10 am or the first hour of the 22nd
Primero arreglen sus servidores
Bloodhounds main here and I’m happy with the revolor
YESSSS
When new stuff and not just recycled things? U should work harder recieveng 60$ selling recolors... The game is loosing a lot of people.. Doing the things how are u doing it u will be like Overwatch now.. it was soo good but now...☠
Everyone isbso focused on the wall running nobody noticed the prowlers. That is gonna be a bit of a challenge aswell
Yeahhhh y’all got me fucked up 60$ for only ONE skin I want 😂😂😂

Does anybody want to try something interesting. (Serious)
October 22nd is my birthday, what a great gift
Is anyome not going to talk ab the fact we have to drop $60 or more to get the bundles we always wanted ?
People in the fortnitemares 2020 have been saying that fortnite copied this. Lol u guys are rught
This is the badass version of the 5 year old version Fortnite copied and posted
https://youtu.be/NUuNLXMWIi0 lit
Jesus Christ is the only way into heaven
I really hope we get a human revenant skin
60 FUCKING DOLLARS FOR THE BLOODHOUND  SKIN ARE YOU CRAZY AND NP HALLOWEEN RAMPART SKIN WTF
Wall running is cool I guess. Honestly this game is kinda getting stale tbh, like rather than do new Halloween skins they're jus doing reskins of  existing ones.
Caustic skin is the best
I'm an African content creator making videoz on apex legends,I feel like nobody really takez Africans seriouz on anything no matter how good you are...I feel like location is also important, is it just a curse to be born here? :(
It is today
Fortnite saco una nueva modalidad que es igual a esta y esta modalidad apex ya la avía sacado ase un año entonces quería saber si fortnite se copio de apex o que? (solo pregunto no me funen)
If you have last years event skins do you have to buy the re-skins or will they be bought with legend tokens?
This event gives me paranoia and ptsd because I feel like someone is always following me      I love it
Apex: Wall run exist  Titanfall veterans: “My time has come.”
Not sure if I like that all shadows die. I liked the shadows vs survivors stuff...
https://youtu.be/vfyN2H82-Mw
When fortnite copies a skin: wow this looks so much better than the original   When Apex copies a skin: whyyyyyyy!!!!
Piensan sacar apex legends para Mobile en un futuro  Quiro jugarlo desde mi celular Una fecha de cuando estaría en la beta  Respondan..   They plan to release apex legends for Mobile in the future I want to play it from my cell phone A date from when I was in beta Answered ..
I love how warzone and fortnite straight up ripped off shadow royal and barely anyone is talking about it
THIS IS LIT
Why are you releasing the skins to be in a bundle?, i just want to buy wraith, i dont want to wate 6000 apex coins on a skin
People that finish in the middle of a battle are p u ssies
The only thing I hate about this is them prices. **cough cough** EA
Society says, this is good, we all do the opposite, which means trying to live something which isnt natural. So, why dont we change what is natural? I’m greedy, alright, im greedy. So, why am i greedy, because my whole education is to have more?
Recycling skins from last year? Great job
Are we ignoring the fact that it's going to be the OG King's canyon with skull town!!
dangerous！！！=͟͟͞͞(๑º ﾛ º๑)ガーン
When does this start? Anyone know?
Me and red might play this together
So yo te debo algo  pero yo no conozco a nadie aquí y no le he pedido nada a nadien
Y no tengo porque esconderme sabes
La neta no te conozco pero cada rato me salen estos comentarios de amenaza
Does anyone know exactly what time this happenes?
Si tú me conoces a mi porque no me hablas de frente yo no sé que madres te he hecho
Yo no sé quién eres mi te conozco
Why does Bangalore never get no love ! BLM !!!!!!
Hol up.  If Lifeline and Octane were shadows teamed with Loba, and Lifeline was reviving Loba, does that mean we still have to finish off the last person of a squad?  *With the shadows on our asses?*
The fact that most of these skins are going to be overpriced for the ones who didn’t get them
Yeeees
the should keep that as a game mode for ever but they wont i love that mode and its sucks it once a year
🙏😇 Buenos días, tardes o noche👋, que Jehová los bendiga👍, si no es así ojalá mejoren👏, si lo es los felicito 😊, vengo a recordar les algunas cosas buscando que el que hace las cosa bien se mantenga en ello y el que no pues que cambie para bien de corazón,  herman@s con cada acción que hacen o le sirven al bien o al mal 🤭, ojalá piensen en cada cosa que hagan pretendiendo siempre hacer el bien😄, por ejemplo haces el bien dando un abrazo 🤗, pero haces el mal si pateas a alguien 🏃‍♂️, piensen lo ¿Que es mejor un abrazo 🤗 o una patada 🦵?  Claramente es mejor un abrazo 🤗 , ¿Entonces porque hacen algunos cosas malas si es mejor hacer cosas buenas🙇? Porque aunque sepan que es mejor hacer cosas buenas🤷, por alguna situación que no les gusta, malos sentimientos y así🤭, hacen el mal en muchos casos lamentablemente, recuerden todo lo malo evitar lo y lo bueno propagarse lo🙅🧏, piensen en esto {Las situaciones buenas y malas se bregan mucho mejor haciendo el bien que el mal🤯}, {El bien mejora, el mal empeora la situación🙃} deben pensar en lo que hacen bien🤔 y tomar la decisión correcta que ya saben cual es ¿Vdd? El bien 😁, ¿Saben algo? En el mundo exiten Algeles, Demonios, Dios, Jesuscristo y así 🙇, lo sé muy posiblemente te han querido hacer  creer que es un cuento inventado, que no es real 🙅y tal ves lo creíste 🤭, como tal ves no 😁, les aconsejo que para creer en algo busquen información que se note que es verídica y así 🤩, no deberían creerle a cualquiera que tal ves quiera engañarte y no sabes si es verdad lo que dice o no🤭, también vengo con la intención de que sepan la verdad y no estén engañados 😅, os digo con muy buena intención que Jehová (Dios) existe, Satanas, demonios, ángeles, Jesuscristo y así también🤭, en muchos lugares la gente es endemoniada, con ello quiero decir que algún demonio entran al cuerpo de alguna persona 💁, ¿Que crees? Llega algún pastor y así, en el nombre de Dios, Jesuscristo y tal😇, sacan al demonio de la persona, los demonios en el cuerpo en algunos casos gritan se descontrol y así🏃, pero en otros casos hacen parecer que no están en la persona y tientan a la persona a hacer cosas mala 👁👄👁, también te pueden tentar aunque no estén en tu cuerpo, la cosa es que en el cuerpo tienen como más alcance🤭, también cuánto tú oras de corazón a Dios atraves de Jesuscristo y así, se siente la presencia de ellos, se siente mucho amor, tranquilidad y tal🥰, al contrario si haces el mal, adoras el mal y así, se siente su presencia de esos seres que te quieren destruir 🤭 y tal ves digas pero si son reales los Demonios, Satanas, porque no los veo y así, sabes que ellos quieren que creas que no es verdad que existen porque así es más fácil destruirte🧏, porque es más posible que te descuides, entonces ellos buscan destruirte sin que te des cuenta de que ellos son reales y que posiblemente te están atacando espiritualmente, físicamente o en lo que es el alma 🙇‍♂️y tal ves digas que Dios, Jesucristo, los Angeles que son buenos y reales ¿Entonces porque no los veo? Recuerda se les puede presentar, pero tal ves no en mucho tiempo y así, pero en algún momento lo verás, porque claramente en la Biblia que es la palabra de Dios escrita a través de algunas personas, dice que en la segunda venida de Jesuscristo todo ojo lo vera, entonces no lo haz visto aún tal ves🤷, debes recordar que los Demonios buscar destruir y así y los Angeles hacer el bien y tal, entonces ellos y también otros seres, no solo ellos, entonces el bien, los Angeles, Jesucristo, Dios y así, no se dejan ver en muchos casos para trabajar para el bien y que los Demonios no estén tal tanto🤗, hay muchas cosas más como que cuando oras y así se siente la presencia de Dios, Jesuscristo, el Espíritu Santo, sus buenos sentimientos y así 😁, los demonios, Satanas tienen el plan de hacer el mal en grande🙅‍♂️, Dios tiene el plan de que hagas las cosas bien, también Los Ángeles, Jesuscristo y así, quieren que siempre estés bien en todo😌, debes hacer el bien y creer en ellos para que sea así😁, pero si haces el mal le sirves al mal, le sirves a los Demonios, Satanas y así los cuales buscan destrozarte de cualquier manera🤭, ¿Ya sabes qué decisión es la que debes tomar🤗? Yo decido hacer el bien de corazón y creer en Jehová ósea Dios que quiere el bien para todos😊, en Jesuscristo que también lo quiere, el cual se sacrifico para que según nuestra acción podamos ir al paraíso o para él infiernos y que no estuviéramos condenados desde un inicio al infierno, también fue para que los Demonios, Satanas y así, tuvieran menos acceso para hacer nos daño y es un muy buen ser, mira si quieren el bien para todos 😅😊, tú con tus acciones te condenas o para el bien o para el mal, hoy mismo puedes dejar de hacer las cosas mal y como Dios, Jesuscristo, Los Ángeles y así son tan buenos, te perdonan si te arrepientes de lo malo que hiciste y cambias para bien, cambias tu condena para bien, recuerda hacer lo de corazón, no por interés😁, creo en los buenas angeles, en Satanas que lamentablemente quiere el mal fuertemente y en los demonios que también es así, recuerden creer en ellos y hacer las cosas bien, que Jehová los bendiga😇🙏.
I don't like it
Shadowfall is my favorite out of all the events and I can't wait for this new game mode to come out!
Imagine Fortnite copying apex
Yayyy... this mode again
Disappointed at the bundle structure of returning skins. Why not sell these skins like the September Soiree? These Halloween 2020 prices are even more ridiculous than normal. These bundles are absurdly expensive.
Bangalore mains left out yet again 😪
Anyone else here after they saw Fortnite did some copy and paste?
OmG tHiS iS a cOpY frOm FoRtniTEmaRes
No revanount skin?
Where is crypto??
the loba buff is bad im sad :(    0:36
Reverant: think You can do it Again?  Me: lets find out
This is soooo epic captain 😀
하나님은 당신에게 다음과 같은 메시지를 보내 십니다 : 당신의 공허함을 채울 수있는 능력을 가진 유일한 소망은 저입니다. 슬픔과 우울증에서 자유롭고, 치유 할 수 있고 진정으로 저를 축복 할 수 있지만 가장 중요한 것은 당신입니다.  구원을주고 영생은 예수님을 통해 나입니다.  인생은 짧고 영원은 아닙니다. 천국이나 지옥 불의 두 가지 방법이 있습니다. 세상은이 메시지를 듣고 싶어하지 않습니다. 그러나 그것은 여러분이 상상할 수있는 것보다 더 현실적입니다. 영원 속에서 영혼을 잃지 마십시오.  이기도를 전심으로 반복하고 믿으십시오.  주 예수님, 저는 죄를 인식하고, 회개하며, 당신을 유일하고 배타적 인 구세주로 받아들이고, 다른 누구에게는 구원이 없으며, 당신이 아버지에게 유일한 길이라는 것을, 생명책에 내 이름을 쓰십시오.  당신.  이제 당신은 구원 받았고 매일기도하고 성경을 읽고 실패하면 회개하고 그는 당신을 용서할 것입니다.  성령 님 께서 당신의 뜻을 행하고 죄를 짓지 않고 주님을 기쁘시게하지 않는 일에서 멀리하라고 지시하라고 말씀하십시오.  그리스도는 곧 오 십니다.  이 단어를 확인하는 다음 구절을 남깁니다.  요한 복음 14 장 예수님, 아버지 께로가는 길 1 마음에 근심하지 마십시오.  당신은 신을 믿고 나도 믿습니다.  2 내 아버지의 집에는 많은 저택이 있습니다.  그렇지 않다면 나는 당신에게 말했을 것입니다.  그래서 나는 당신을위한 장소를 준비 할 것입니다.  3 내가 가서 너를 위해 자리를 준비하면 내가 다시 와서 너를 데려 가서 내가 여기있을 수 있도록 너도있을 것이다.  4 당신은 내가 어디로 가는지, 당신은 길을 알고 있습니다.  5 토마스가 그에게 말했다 : 주님, 우리는 당신이 어디로 가고 있는지 모릅니다.  그러면 우리는 방법을 어떻게 알 수 있습니까?  6 예수 께서 그에게 이르시되 나는 길이 요 진리 요 생명이다.  나를 위해서만 아버지에게 오지 않습니다.  7 네가 나를 안다면 내 아버지도 알고있을 것이다.  이제부터 우리는 그를 알았고 당신은 그를 보았습니다.  요한 계시록 20:15 15 생명책에 기록되지 않은 사람은 불못에 던져졌습니다.
God sends you the following message:如果您说中文，则该消息位于此评论的结尾 The only hope is in me, who has the ability to fill your emptiness is me, who is free from sadness and depression, who can heal, truly bless me, but most importantly, who you  gives salvation and eternal life is me through Jesus.  Life is short, eternity is not, there are only two ways, heaven or hell fire, the world does not want to hear this message, but it is more real than what you can imagine, do not lose your soul in eternity, go to  me, just repeat and believe this prayer with all your heart;  Lord Jesus, I recognize that sin, I repent, I accept you as the only and exclusive savior, that in no one else there is salvation, that you are the only way to the father, write my name in the book of life, that you help me to live to  you.  Now you are saved, keep in daily prayer, read the bible, and if you fail you will repent and he forgives you.  Tell the Holy Spirit to direct you to do his will and to keep you away from sinning and what does not please the Lord.  Christ is coming very soon.  I leave you the following verses that confirm this word.  John 14 Jesus, the way to the father 1 Do not let your hearts be troubled;  You believe in God, I also believe in me.  2 In my Father's house are many mansions;  if not, I would have told you;  So I am going to prepare a place for you.  3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and take you to myself, so that I may be here, you may also be.  4 You know where I am going, you know the way.  5 Thomas said to him: Lord, we do not know where you are going;  How then can we know the way?  6 Jesus said to him: I am the way, and the truth, and the life;  no one comes to the father but for me.  7 If you knew me, you would also know my Father;  and from now on we knew him, and you have seen him.  Revelation 20:15 15 And whoever was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire. 上帝向你传达了以下信息：唯一的希望就在我身上，谁有能力填补你的空虚？我是谁，我没有悲伤和沮丧，谁可以治愈，真正祝福我，但最重要的是，你是谁 通过耶稣给予救赎，永生是我。 生命短暂，永恒不存在，只有两种方式，天堂或地狱之火，世界不想听到这个信息，但是它比你想像的更真实，不要在永恒中迷失自己的灵魂，去 我，重复一遍，全心全意地祈祷。 主耶稣，我认识到罪恶，我悔改，我接受你作为唯一和唯一的救世主，没有其他人可以得到救赎，你是通往父亲的唯一途径，在生活书中写下我的名字，你可以帮助我活下去 您。 现在您得救了，继续每天祈祷，读圣经，如果失败，他会悔改，他会原谅您。 告诉圣灵指引你去执行他的旨意，使你远离犯罪和什么不讨上帝喜悦的事情。 基督很快就要来了。 我留下以下经文来确认这个词。 约翰福音14耶稣，通往父亲的道路1不要让你的心烦恼。 您相信上帝，我也相信我。  2在我父的家里有许多大厦。 如果没有，我会告诉你的。 所以我要为你准备一个地方。  3如果我去为你准备一个地方，我会再次来，把你带到我自己，这样我可能在这里，你也可能在这里。  4你知道我要去哪里，你知道路。  5托马斯对他说：主阿，我们不知道你要去哪里。 那我们怎么知道呢？  6耶稣对他说：我是道路，是真理，是生命。 除了我，没有人来父亲。  7如果你认识我，你也会认识我的父。 从现在开始，我们认识了他，而您也看到了他。 启示录20:15 15凡未找到生命册上记载的人，都被扔进火湖中。
1:12 Trust no one, not even yourself
An epic classic
Kool PS3 game
Can't wait for the over priced cosmetics and reskins
Show Bangalore some love.. damn.

https://discord.gg/7MjZRG

The one chance to give revenant a halloween skin 😤
*APEX ANDROID*

Too bad all the OG skins aren’t coming back
How many people didn't get that weapon skin lol
Better than last event
Bloodhound looking sexy 😜
Revanant: doesn't wants to die  Also Revanant: if you gotta do something right don't do it yourself

Gracias de corazón y perdon por el spam LOS QUIERO❤
Bloodhound skin is incredible
Los de fornite les copiaron el evento jajajaj
i remember when this game used to be so much fun, but they never changed anything, so it bored me after 200hours+
More xp ?
We want Apex Legend: Mobile 😩
great another event to crash the servers
Yay my mirage skin didn’t comeback 😬
Them recolored skins tho 😒
You should sub and watch me play this
They messed up their chance to give octain a day of the dead outfit 😩
00:19 WHO IS THIS 😱
Fortnite kids: THEY COPIED FORNITE WTF BRO
Man I’m not sure if I like them bringing back all the cosmetics from last Halloween, I felt kind of privileged having that caustic skin from last year and it was kind of nice that nobody else hardly ever has it or should I say had it
Fortnite is copy this gamemod
The theme sounds like L4D
confirmed another over hyped event and respawn ignores major fixes the game desperately needs. path still has a 35 sec max grapple lol. Worst audio I have ever experienced. Worst servers I have ever experienced. Fov around corners getting shot when you're obviously around a corner. SHIT LEGEND AFTER SHIT LEGEND. SINCE WATTSON THE GAME HAS GIVEN US ZERO COMPETITIVE LEGENDS ONLY PUB STARS TO INFLATE THEIR WALLETS.
Yay another limited time event. Im so excited for a mode that will be fun for 10 games and will never be seen again. Seriously tho im pretty sick of this model of limited modes. Can we please get a couple more permanent modes.... preferably non br modes like mirage's winter express? After a few thousand games apex starts to suffer from a lack of diversity in modes and speaking from experience, when you get burned out u have to quit the game and come back later. Id rather get burned on one type of mode and swap to another gamemode.
1:11 New revenant finisher?
Spooky
Aw i love pathfinders mummy skin
По мне так это офигенно,особенно если углублятся в графике,то можно было сделать и получше,но а так четко! Оцените мой контент люди,если не сложно
Can't wait to spend 300$ again, should've just made titanfall 3 already.
Any heirloom this time I hope Loba or Cypto
Kinda suck when your internet out
Apex: Brings Halloween event back. Overwatch players: *vietnam flashbacks
Me: seeing the new skins  My wallet: my time has come

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mMneBxQXJk
recycled event,
Anyone wanna play:FadeReverse1
I hope that they can add a heirloom system that would do A: allow you to get enough shards to get an heirloom by reaching levels 100, 200, 300, 400,  and 500 so it feels like more of an accomplishment. B: be able to get enough heirloom shards to get another heirloom by sacrificing an owned heirloom. C: allow you to trade heirlooms with other players from across the globe. Or D: all of the above. If apex is reading this please take this into consideration. And to legends that see this comment, please like it so the apex team can see it. Thank you for reading this and let me know if you agree.

Peniwise
So resurrected means reskinned
I want to like Apex so much, but honestly, I'm utterly terrible at BR games.  Hell most MP games, I'm terrible at but BR games especially.  Still just hoping that we'll one day see Titanfall 3.
So fortnite now is taking the credit for this masterpiece smfh
Pls fix mouse input lag
Well, fortnite copied this and nobody noticed-
WHY DID YOU NERF WRAITH FOR!!!!
( John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. ) We are living out Revelations in the Bible, please repent with your mouth to God and admit you are a sinner, Jesus died for us all and if we accept this gift he did we can be saved but we have to first repent and ask the Holy Spirit to come into Our lives and turn from sins. Believe Jesus died and rose again 3 days later so we can all be saved!! Pray often and seek a true relationship with God and get a Bible. Start reading your Bible, KJV is one type but this is an example where you can start. I know the Bible in Revelations talks about end times, we are living that out now. Please choose Jesus while he can still be found!  You Don't know when your last breath will be! 🙏💐
今回のコロナ被害拡大の原因は中国の春節爆買いを目当てにした観光協会の一部の人間と創価学会のせいです。  その観光協会の会長が自民党内公明派の筆頭二階幹事長であり、二階が公明党に依頼し、結果厚労省、国交省がコロナ対策を遅らせ、又、コロナはインフルエンザと変わらないと世論を誘導しました。  結果、そのせいで肝心の観光業が一番打撃を受けています。  オリンピックを裏金を使い、東京に招いたのにも創価が関わっていると目されているのに、それをこの様な形で潰しておいて、自分達だけは事務手数料利権で儲けようとしている呆れた連中です。
💥Explosion coke https://youtu.be/4fuwLMjy3rg
Why is everyone saying “Fortnite copied this’’ have you analized that this update came out yesterday and Fortnite’s update came out just today? Do you think they could plan, program and apply this just in one day of difference, is just a coincidence open your eyes
クソイベント

Nice to see u still cashing players out while doing nothing about the actual gameplay. Still the servers are crashing down and the matchmaking is the worst. Playing solo and almost every match getting stomped by 3stack 20b/4k players in pubs. Great work respawn, great work
0:20 pilot hmmm
Where is evac ship(((
So they're basically making Apex have a Titanfall event, minus the titans, add the shadows
Lazily Recycled < Resurrected
And fortnite had to copy it
I hope this stay solo the last fight or fright event was a solo gamemode untill the last ten legends fight together to escape in the drop ship
Would gave been so cool if we got a rev enant heirloom for halloween
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken God’s name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers. James 2 : 10 also states that breaking even just one commandment makes us guilty of breaking them all.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because The Creator is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, EVERY sin will be brought to light, and punished. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved. Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you sincerely do so, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. Also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God has in store for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most Critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27); ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i
Ooh a Titanfall 3 Beta Test!
The skins from caustic are getting too sick

Now fortnite stold the idea of the shadows
If Respawn makes us pay actual coin or crafting material to buy re colors of those Halloween skins it will be the scummiest shit they've done yet.

I wish apex is popular again

I hope the old ltm also return.
Uninstalled apex might redownload just for this, wont spend money on the rehashed recolor of old skins.   How lazy of respawn to not even make new skins just recolor the ones they got.   Seems there's not enough people playing.  Tsk tsk
What time?
Dang bro I'm ready
"You could not lived with you're own failure what did that bring you back to me"

am i the only one noticing a dead IMC soldiers,respawn,you better not mess thing's up,ok
Alguna vez se han preguntado por que tenemos cortes de justicias,jueces,policias,milicia etc..? Esto es porque nos importa la justicia porque somos creados a la semejancia de un Dios justo.  Nosotros hemos pecado en su contra y roto sus leyes que tenemos en nuestras conciencias; cuando mentimos, adulteramos, robamos, somos orgullos, tenemos sexo antes del matrimonio, pornografia y muchas cosas mas, lo cual un Dios justo condenaria al igual que condenaria asesinato y violacion.  Dios es justo de condenarnos a todos pero en su amor y misericordia nos ofrece otro camino, el envio a su unico Hijo Jesus para que muriera en nuestro lugar por nuestras faltas y despues resucitara para justificarnos para todo aquel que se arrepienta de sus malos caminos y ponga su fe en Jesus sea salvo; Como un hombre que se tira de un avion y no confia en sus brazos para salvarse sino que confia en el paracaidas, asi nosotros debemos confiar en Jesus y no en nuestras buenas obras para ser salvo", porque delante de Dios nadie se va a poder justificar por su cuenta solo atravez de Jesus, por esto Jesus es el unico camino hacia Dios
I’m way to excited and adicted to apex
You should give revenat a grim reaper skin
So where is the dlc pack for the audio? When does that come out?
Это всё красиво, но снова ни одной новости о стим версии..

So uhhhhhhh revenant buff maybe when you use your ultimate you turn in to a zombie cause that wall run looks epic or maybe octane when you use your stim

This is legit the most laziest, money hungry bullshit I have ever seen in a game.
Bloodhund using aim bot lol
They could not even design new skins, lmao and they still going to charge 10€ each What a cock game
Is no one asking about air strafing in shadow form
Okay, dont miss this mode again please.
Revenant killing revenant,ok🗿
"Everyone saying it will be fun with wallrunning" *Me knowing that i am the one who is supposed to stay alive while my teammates go kill themselves*
So we get the same game mode as last year and recolored skins .......
WOW
YESSS BLOODHOUND SKIN COMING BACKK SHRHCKAKEBKVKQKDMVKF
HELL YEAH, WALL RUNNING
The fact that the shadow revenant kills the other its just ... Wow
Epic
make apex for switch
今回も神イベントありがとう運営
🧟‍♀️🎃💀👻🧟‍♂️？
Wait revenant kills himself wtf ¿
00:43ウォールラン...?
Aah shet here we go again
Cool, but why do they have to be recolours instead of actual new skins
Aye Apex Fortnite really copied your gamemode for halloween like come on be orignal.
Shadow rev to rev: Don’t trust no one   *NOT EVEN YOURSELF*
Wait... Revenant joined Apex game, so who will do *Fight of Fright* event ? Of course not Revenant, because he are be killed by phantom
So, are we going to spend real money on the Reskins if we already own the previous ones or no?
また、エアプですか？
I don’t want wall running ...
Skull town Is back les go
Mode interensting
For all titanfall players you are gonna feel at home with this double jump and wall running thank you respawn
i’m really sad that we’re not getting bang heirloom but we did just get caustic so it’s okay
Does respawn know that both fornite and MW copy them again?
Me and the are going to play this
Sooo whats the ETA on the foot step bug?
Best battle royale by far
YES
OMG NICE!
Zombie mood is back
Now, this, is epic

0:17 I quit my 9-5 with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Fortnite is better
Guys to play the mode it’s only gonna cost 10 dollar !!
Everyone picks Watson and hides in a room behind 4 barricades. That's this game mode! Shite!
Mark my words, that zombie character is going to be an upcoming legend who's abilities will be wall running and double jumping (maybe thats gon be his ultimate?)
Fortnite copied this too lmao xD
Apex help FORTNITE IS COPYING YOUR EVENT please like ban them and don’t let fortnite see this
Anyone notice you can watch this video in 4k resolution..... hm...
So we get the same skins with a color change :/ I mean I guess
I cant understand why fortnite keeps copying apex if you watched the fortnitemares trailer and your an apex player You know they copied shadow fall cmon respawn tell epic to stop copying apex first the respawn beacons now our lts the midas revange trailer littrely had shadow fall
Nothing better than giving another revenant a finisher

New mode = *Fight Or Fridge: Shadow Royale* fridge is a joke btw
Yeah boiiii i get to use bloodhound now for this event i did not get to play cause i did not have gold on my xbox
fortnite has to copy apex wowwwwwwww they copied shadows
New revenant finisher?
Boo
Please fix the servers please i cant play in any server
If only my ps4 was working
We should have an advanced movement legends where the tactical allows you to do Titanfall things for short period of time
I'm so hyped for this
that a new revenant finisher?
Apex never disappoints
Me: Guys have you seen the apex Halloween event trailer  My classmates: Bro the fortnite Halloween update is epic  Me:*disappointed*
*inner veteran titanfall pilot squeals like a fucking child seeing candy*
So if I want JUST the caustic recolour I have to pay for an entire bundle that includes the OG skin I already have and 2 weapon skins I don't want??
It's times like these that the EA in Apex shines though. Gating skins in bundles as a cash grab is anti-player behaviour and is very disappointing.
pk？
YEEEE TITANFALL  WALL RUNNING YAY
I had liked this video, but i've changed to a dislike. You are gating certain skins behind bundles as a cash grab. ALL skins should be available for individual purchase. This is a very EA move and i'm dissappointed.
Can’t wait but was that wall riding in apex from titan fall 2 and 1?
What got me interested is that you can run side to side on the walls
ローバ強化ナイス
1:11 New finisher?
Ok since we are going to fight or fright revs map does that mean that it's the old map before all the changes like crypto town takeover and others
How can ppl be happy about this? Its the same skins as last year im kinda dissepointed
Haunting of verdansk: sorry son, your days are over
Who’s fade? revenant says at the beginning fade brought you back
:o
I played when this first came out... I wish I got some skins😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
OMG I love apex But i cant handle randoms anymore I mean they are so Garbage I mean sometimes its alright because their kind but others are just TOXIC
Let’s go easy 20 bomb and 4K damage I’ve been waiting for this to come back
Yes this is epic yo I like it man that why I play apex do one of you guys play this game ❤️
20bomb ¿
vrey good but i love revenant andi love new skin for revenant
WALLRUNING!!!!!
why would you make something this scary
Nice to know that they’re continuing the story from Season 3, followed by Season 5’s quest.
OMGGGG
OMG this is cool halloween trailer and caustic to Loba?
Revenant heirloom?
The “couldn’t have said it better myself” moment at the end is a really nice cherry on top
The warzone event wasnt as good as I thought it would be, i have a feeling this apex event will be better
Dude we can do wallrun already since the season 3 ı guess XD          (I know it is not as effective as the new one of course :))
Welp time to make my pockets hurt again lol
I'm hella excited bro.
Me, titanfall veteren: *you’re all going to die down here*
Now 2020
It came at season 3
Plz put back the r99 and pk on the ground plz
It's back
Re used and re skinned
Like 👌😂   If you got your 20 kill badge last season with WATTSON Lol  Mine was 25 kills and 197 damage
You ca-n make all legends to skidive pls😭
Wall run? What is next...fort building?
omg i love apex
This game would be a lot better if wraith mains didn't leave everytime they get knocked.
The only thing I want is old town mirage inject that shit into my blood stream I need it
*TitanFall Flashbacks*   Me: This is gonna get easier and easier...
WALLRUNNING, LET'S GO
So damn good u know apex legends is the best game eeeeee!!!!!!!!
bro look at caustic
At 00:19 could that be a teaser for a future legend?(Watch in 0.25 speed)
If you're reading this I really hope you become a God at apex
New revenant finisher? 1:11
There's gonna be a legend that can wall run
I've just hit Gen 3 in Titanfall 2 so I think the wallruning might be my strong point
Watson needs a Halloween skin.
Who dose crypto then
I'm hoping I get to upgrade my jack o lantern bloodhound instead of having to buy the red version.
1:10 new finisher for revanant
Same Halloween event as last year, with a few tweaks.....Warframe anyone 🤔
Bro another caustic skin really :/
PC GAMERS WELCOME TO THE CONSOLES LOBBYS, YOUR WELCOME. 🤗
0:21
Why isn't it a collection event? Where's the Bangalore heirloom set
Woo yeah baby thats what we been waiting for
This is e🅱ic
Same skins different colors...
Oh yes, time for my time in Titanfall 2 to shine! I will purposely die just so I become a shadow. I don't care about normally running around now, I WANNA WALLRUN!
OMG cant believe Im NOT playing this game
Who's excited
Wall run?
I hear my wallet want to scream ,,:D
Hope the cross save gonna come quickly for play with this skin on a real plateform
We need a werewolf bloodhound skin
again, no bangalore exclusive skins lol
WOO WE GETTING WALL RUNNING LETS GO
So happy the evnt is back i was so bad the first time this event was out

TITANFALL MOVEMENT
Wall Runnnnnnnnn
bloodhound: what haunts you most is death  me: what haunts me most is my wallet after this
I swear if there's no hero updates I'm done with the game for good. The lack of hero changes are horrendous, the last update wasn't even special at all (hero updates).
First time we’ve seen two of the same legends in a trailer
Warzone has done way better halloween event than this
Meh
Finally Bloodhound gets a great skin. Bloodhound Gang always❤️.
Boo
Im so excited to to update my apex
You guys can do better cosmetic designs even fan art cgi was more epic than this. Personally love the re colors but wish we had more story or better graphics.
https://www.dexerto.com/apex-legends/apex-legends-dev-explains-why-legends-never-wall-run-abilities-1436329/
https://youtu.be/EXVopBy_xDg I swear u have never seen bamboozles like this...next level
LETS GOO
*DID I JUST FUCKING SEE WALLRUNNING AND DOUBLE JUMPING?!?!*
Apex went to far awesome
Just a redesign of last years skins....... not that cool tbh
Bro omg I might like being the shadows now
I'm looking forward to the Titan Pilot Legend. I'm so hyped for that now that wallrunning is a thing. Plus titanfall 3 has been confirmed. Everything is about to be tied together and come full circle!!!
I can see the Titanfall 2 tech there😏
WALL RUN MY LEGENDS
Aww yea, we got wall running back🔥🔥🔥
anyone else think that they fucked up
New revenant finisher??
I want to know if this event is going to be canon like the one of the last year
Love it
E P I C O
why they gotta reuse skins tho
Rev still needs a skeleton skin for Halloween.
That rez animation isn't likely to remain restricted to this event.
me:  I love that bloodhound skin!!!                                                                                                                                                                      my wallet: pls let me live i dont wanna dieee
I hope you give 1 random skin to all people who have been waiting this event
Would it be possible for Respawn to allow purchasable items with Apex Legend tokens
Wow nice game-mode!! il see you guys there!!!!
Let’s goo but there’s no pathfinder 😔
I. Am. Beautiful.
This is good but I like the last one more
When you showed the skins changing into different colors are we gonna be able to get the regular skin with it too? Or have to buy it with our ig u can say renown points
Bringing back last years event you kids are gonna spend hella huh for this shit
またえぺ自分の中で再燃する可能性を感じた
課金を要求するイベント
I have a suggestion:Can you guys have selling skins for scraps like when you dont like a particular skin, you just sell them for a specific amount depending on what rarity it has for ex:Legendary skin=500 crafting metals. Its hard to earn scrap just by leveling up. Hope somebody notice this
my gosh is halloween now
why does this event look familiar?
A year for reskins.......
Ima get wrath skin 💯💯
They ruined the wraith skin
No pathfinder skin :(
Honestly love the skins but prices and rng loot boxes are probably gonna ruin that shit
Apex i love you but could you really not come up with a better revenate custom?
ローバのジャンプドライブの硬直少なくなってる？
WHEN ARE WE GETTING A CRYPTO SKIN
Apex finally pulling 'but can you do this' on other BRs
Could we maybe implement a system where you could choose 3 characters, say your 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice, that way if your team chooses your 1st and 2nd you won't end up as a random character. I can't tell you how many times I have ran to the bathroom and came back to see I was someone I wouldn't normally choose. Thank you!!
So no one gonna talk about the zombie octane skin at 0:20
0:26 bo3 vibes rn
Imagine using the same skins. Honestly sad
pleasee  bring red weapons to ground in this ltm as in armed and dangerous ltm
Since wallrunning is coming just for the shadows, everyone is probably going to get themselves killed on purpose
Wall running? Ok get a pilot in this game right now!!
Can’t wait 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
same shit rehashed and people are praising it? wow lol
Damnnnnnnn
Everyone got a new skin  Bangalore : ah shit here we go again
You guys are good at trailers, but you need to fix a lot of shit with your actual game before putting more garbage skins. I'm moving to cod if you do not fix these errors
I kinda dislike that shadowfall is now squad, on single it was more scary
Revanent gets KARMA
Apex is making fortnite look stupid
Fireeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee apex with the new content back to back to back
So Titan Fall movement
Ion care if someone ignores me or not but I need all of those cosmetics and if you are around California Buena Park hook me up with like a QUICK JOB only for the items I just want the items and that’s IT !!!!!!!!!!
Runnings on walls?!?.. Great, get ready for tha wall spammers 🤦  are u guys tryna make me RAGE?
More drama between the two reventants. One went crazy and one wants to die. Let's see this go down.
octane needs a purge skin
and me waiting for them to release NEW skins
Come on man my wallet already had a meltdown once this month. you’re making me mega broke now apex! 😾
Ok this is gunna cost 100.
きたー！ハロインイベント
the nostalgia from titanfall is insane
Random Guy: What the Hell Are You Rev: *A Simp*
It's always knife to see some new content (YouTubeers  take this take this from rev
Wall run hnngg
0:38 buff loba?
0:50 mirage died again
It looks as if there might be a Loba buff where she can move a bit faster after landing with her tactical, though that may just be for  ✨💓cinematic effect💕✨
And so now Respawn starts recycling events   Ovwrwatch players: oh hey Jeff, I almost didn't see you there.
Garbage
again why can’t mirage get any good attention...
spooky scary revenant, send shivers down your spine
All sick besides the huge paywall to bundle these skins up 😤🥵
I like how the caustic skin looks in the tittle screen
I wanna wall run like Titanfall now
revenant vs shadow revenant.  Hell yeah now it's finally happening.
BRUH were pathfinders skin?
Pk back?
Finally, us tf veterans can wreck Apex newbies
They better give revenant a Halloween skin
As much as i love this game, and how i love the whole october events this game has. I still can't get over, how BAD the Loba halloween skin is. But even so, i'll still get the pack that has the Loba skin in.
Does octane have a skin
Titanfall players: *MANIACAL LAUGHING*
Personally I was hoping for a selection of new skins, would have loved to have seen a decent Pathfinder Halloween skin. Have to say, kinda disappointed :/
dose anyone know whos getting the hearloom
Wall... jump???
Bringt solo Modus wieder rein Plss
I peeped they been throwing us a lot of fun events they should keep doin it, makes me wanna play everyday
Alright!time for some action boys!
Ah shit Titan Fall 2 came to apex where the roboys
WHEN APEX ON SWITCH?
Excited for this ☠️☠️☠️☠️
Y’all rarely do something new lol hire a new team please. Game getting old.
Looks very good ✌️
Please don’t make it all bundles just sell all skins separate and bundles if yall want just not all i just want the wraith skin 😔
Lower the skins to 1000 coins/skin, and keep making skins like this and I'll buy them all. You'll get more money and I get nice shit. Do it right.
WHY IS NO-ONE TALKING ABOUT THE CHARACTER AT 0:19??
Why are they starting it later this year than last year?
This feels so uncanny watching an apex trailer in 4K resolution...
Yay its back
WHAT ABOUT SERVERS???? SERVERSS????
You guys could've just brought new Halloween skins and left the old skins rare and legendary but noooooo, you guys had to copy fortnite with the same skin just a different color type of shit.
I'm grinding rewards points on my xbox so I can play this bro
Pls put the wall run on the game not just on that event
Was hoping for new skins.
0:20 TitanFall？？
Hehe, I can unleash my full power with all my pilot skills now
IM SO FREAKING EXCITED I HAVE TOO PEE.
I’m hype for the wall running!!!
Yay
I’m getting the skins for my birthday certently
New event New Bugs
could not come up with new skins? no new skin for loba or anyone? just recolor?
AAAAAA!!!! WALL RUNNING!!!!!!
When will this be out
OMG
Damn
Oh wow..nothing..again..good job respawn👏🏻
Oh God I still have PTSD form last halloween man I'm not ready for the shadows
Okay this is lame
Um..........
To all Titanfall Veterans!       Go easy on me pls
Skull town is back baby
Respawn: "sorry we are not going to mess whit the game mechanics as we did with the "time to kill" at the beginnign of season 6 anymore" Also Respawn: *adds fkn wall running like its not going to change the way tha game is played*
かっこいいがすぎるぞ
I. Just noticed the zombie in the supply thing is the pilots from titan fall
Rev new execution?
No way apex these skin are too expensive you disappointed  me as a customer, you are not giving the option to purchase what we want and not the whole bundle,  that's horrible.
Unsurprisingly this is not new to Titanfall |2 players.
Is it cannon that there are two revenants
WALLRRRRUUUUUUUUNNNNNNIING
The first time they did was was the most fun I ever had. This will be even better. Yeeehaaaawwww
Why are all the battle royal copying us warzone zombie mode copied apex fortnite copied map why we are running out of ideas c'mon copy other games let play like villains
Not even 2 years old and all we get is recycled content and recolored skins still. I guess a game can only live for so long
new rev finisher???
Why are we playing the good guys
Yawn 🥱
they should lower the price of the event packs for this one just because it's the same skins but recolored, but knowing the devs they're not gonna do that.
YASSSSS
Couldn't have said it better myself. *kills himself with a nade trying to wallrun*
I’m gonna punch my tv again by accident
I love how they advertise limited never again accessible skins that people buy with money, then they release better recolors of those skins
When is it coming
I m just crazy for this game,its mine favorite gane ever😍😍😍😍
Wonder if we'll see the halloween voice quips included in the bundles from last year, maybe the banner poses as well? On the website it said all "24 Fight or Fright Event Cosmetics" will be returning in the form of bundles or offers.
I missed this event last year not missing it again. Content here I come.
Titanfall veterans, it’s time
imagine they do the wall run in the upcoming arena mode
Bro i hope they add those skills to revenant he will be a god
One doesn't own emotion, and when one is owned by emotion, it's a reflection of one's belief that one owns them ⭕️
lol $40 skins event.
Not spending 60$ for a wraith recolor
I’m on verge of quitting, servers have always sucked out in Canada
Can't wait! 🔥
Wattson 👀?
Yes , indeed I can do it again
Wish my games were as easy as the trailer
seriously hoping they have some more future plans for wallrun
When they don’t show the Bangalore recolor
Standby for Shadowfall, Pilots :)
Oh yeah I have shots at thursday ):
Apex: *drops new content* My wallet: Ah shit! Here we go again.
I thought this was horror movie for a sec
This looks nice. I went back to play on the xbox one x and man the game is just so bad. 30fps, stutters and massive lag like What happened to this game?
Why can’t they just give us the new style if we had the original 😭😭😭😭😭
Copy paste i see... welp I know what 2021 Halloween is gonna be at this rate smh
Not againnnn
Yooooo you know I’m stealing that credit card
Damn, I liked the idea last year with playing Solo, where you only had to rely on yourself to either win or lose. But if this gamemode can still work in teams, then I guess I can give it a shot. (It was pretty fun. I hope to see it again.)
ローバの硬直時間短くなってた？
do not go overboard They are very expensive I only want Bloohthound and Wraith I don't want crypto
brothers, sisters, my fellow pilots.  our time has come to show off our skills once more and bring destruction wherever we go. go forth my brothers and sisters and show them no mercy, make them feel pain. show them the superior skills of pilots!!!
Trash
Please please tell me I will be able to get those Halloween reskins with the tokens Spence I already have the original skins
So they adding wall running or is it like an item you find on the ground that gives you that ability because in titanfall 2 on the pilots back theres thrusters to stabilize the pilot while running on walls
I need apex coin
I can’t get the octane skin now. Because they don’t have it in the challenges list
wooooooooow my god
God damn, Apex Legends has the best trailers.
Why do yall gotta keep beating my boi mirage up? Leave my man's alone for once 😂🎃
Мы дождались бега по стенам как в титанах?  Наконец-то
finnaly we can run on walls
Good damn this is epic
Ik can this be ravrant  abladys  please
Ya really be hyping it. This shit looks boring af lol
I assume wallrunning is going to be Horizons Passive ability then - or another legends passive
cod literally stole this epic game mode
BRADDA GIBRALTA RE-SKIN LOOKING NASTY Y'ALL CHEEE WOOOO!!!🤙🏽💪🏽🤙🏽
0:43 wallrun!? 壁走りできるキャラくるなこれ！
OMFG!!!!!!
Nice and all. But I would rather have improvements than content. To me a game that works and is balanced, is way more fun than a game with loads of content.
At least they recolored the rereleased skins....
omg its on thurseday i love it
Oh boy.....reskinned event skins.
I misses this so much its been a year
타이탄폰의 벽타기가 보였다?!?!?!?!?!?
B-but what about lifeline :(
Awww so i cant kill my teamates as a revenant? ;-;
I was really hoping for new halloween skins. If there was a werewolf skin that character was going to be my forever main
Like tomorrow
WHERE ARE THE PATCH NOTES
One thing worst than getting chase by shadows.......a wall running TF 2 veteran shadow
Finally it back I wonder if the costume are a like oh style because I have every halloween skin form last time
Its like titanfall but zombies from the past. Cant wait to try this next week
FINNALY I CAN USE OCTANE
This video has awesome written all over it
YES! apex players can now experience true rush and just like in Titanfall with wall running and double jumps, it’s just perfect 👌
New revenant finisher???!?!
Literally give octane a cool skin idk grim reaper or some shit that skin is doodoo
Is Mirage Cowboy Skin coming back 🤠?
Spooki time
SWEET DREAMS
Good Warzone!
Can't wait to wall run jump 360 and hit someone for 150 damage.
yessss
Can’t we just Appreciate that pathfinder has unlimited ammo while bloodhound only has 28? ;)
Long live Apex! I live this game!
WALL RUNNING! WALL RUNNING!
Yo it is back
did rev commit suicide at the last part?
Cod is still better
YOU GUYS SHOULD OF DONE WORLDS EDGE AFTER DARK.... and Old Old Worlds edge with old capital @apexlegends @respawn SEE I THINK OF THE BEST IDEAS.... 💡
WALL RUN CONFIRMED!
Crazy, I still remember this event from like last year I guess.
Wall running? Double jumping? Dope finishers? What’s next, busted spitfire? This is becoming titanfall 2. And I like it
Just to let you know that there's wall run. Titanfall OG would be happy for a few days
that wraith skin thouuu is it gonna be part of the skin or a whole different skin I'm talking bout the white one
im glad that respawn still remember titanfall 2 and ad it at apex
OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That moment when the entire titanfall 2 community downloads apex legends to teach them what a real game is like wall running is going to make apex kittens fear us...
Time to kill each other?
Bruh, i was saving up my coins cuz i thought we would get a legendary octane Halloween skin. I am disappointed. But i guess i will get bloodhound
ウォールランすげー！しかもTF2みたいにできるやん！ しかもなんかローバのワープ硬直無くなってる？だとしたらローバ使ってる人は有難い強化だ！運営ありがとう😊
F
WALL RUNNNN YOOOOOOOO
Low key absolutely getting that purple bloodhound skin. Bloodhound needs more purpleeeeee <3
I loved wall running in titan fall 2 now in this game, im going to mop up all the noobs
Are they shadows or are they pilots in  disguise?lol
Rip witch waifu
screw being alive im gonna get killed to be a shadow so i can finally wallrun
WALL RUNNING?!?!?! These new players won't know what hit them
I AM HYPE!!
0:21 pause and u will see a pilot from titanfall
Oooooo
Okay respawn can we make this a permanent game mode
OMG!!!!!!!GOD!!!!!!
WHERE IS THE CRYPTO OMG
those mode are more incredible than the old one.
Just realized that the zombies are IMC grunts
Y’all really lacked the creativity to make new skins?
Omg wall running!
Can we get a rev skin with his human head yet 😭
God created us with free will.  He will NOT cross that will.   For people whom think that God would never send people to such a horrid place as hell.   1st God doesn't send anyone anywhere.   2nd Believing on and in Jesus or not, is our choice...... Our will.  3rd We send ourselves , to our own destination.  4th God has restrained his power to our will.  5th God is not a cheater.... And he most defiantly wouldn't cheat himself ,his own rules or His Glory!  6th God mourns each soul lost.....   Lost..... While found was FREE.  Run to Jesus. Time is short!!!  @
Couldn't have said it better myself
Titanfall fan‘s here. “Welcome to the reckoning！”
I miss shadowfall but this looks epic
Yay in finally back :DDDDD
This movie so coooool!!
Same skins dif color omg 🤦‍♂️
Wraith skin is backkk
Y gotta bring the og skins back ffs
Wall run wall run wall run!!!!!!! Yes!!!
As a revenant main, this video made me happy.
Wall running !!! 😍
The poorly managed game filled with bugs and cheaters is the real horror. How far this game has fallen since this time a year ago.
wow :,D
wowowoow i imagine if we can run on walls in season 7
YES we get wall runing thats all I needed to see
Wow if you say this is not good you need to get your priorities in order this is so good I am a programmer myself and my trailers are epic but this is so good and I can tell the amount of clips you need to make this good so good job Respawn
No octane skin :(
As a revnant main I am super happy with the new finisher
This whole recycling old skins thing is getting a bit old.
For the New season can you put the R99 back and the divo on the drop pls
I hope we get a sweet gift haha
W A L L R U N
I hope we get a sweet gift haha
TITANFALL FANS      ARISEEEEE
TITANFALL!!!!!!
Here come all the dejected Warzone casualties.
Recycled skins... Awesome...
I cant wait 🤩
Nice
YOOO OUR REVENANT MERCS THE ALTERNATE ONE
but like... isn't that a Titanfall grunt at 0:19 ???!!??
I hope this isn’t like live die live where people thirst the last person and there’s no shadows
Ready for the Halloween spooks!
https://youtu.be/ND4DYvrIzi8
You should get the recolors free if you had the original or you should be able to buy them with legend tokens if you have the original
kings canyon is backkk
Oh boy more recycled content
C'mon, if its an event like this, you should give every legend a skin
Kind of lame but I’ll take it
I don't wanna get the bundle just to get the wraith skin please tell me I can get her as a stand alone
every heirloom set should have a finisher with the heirloom
Respawn back the PeaceKeeper please 🥺
I'M SO HYPED🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 👌👌
Su ptm
finally, a chance to try this gamemode!
I can finally play shadowfall
Goddamn so many bots in this comment section
Revenant is smiling for getting a new event lmao
so all the new skins are recolors? uh cool?
Once you wallrun.....you cant go back
次の新キャラもしかしたらパイロットか？
how lazy do you have to be as a developer to use the same legendary skins as last year but with different color layouts. HOLY SHIT THATS SAD
sorry apex didn't join the aftermarket event
When is it
So basically just recolours of last years event, you had a whole year to make them as good as last year and you just hit that copy paste.
If that leaked arena mode is fr I really think it’d be benefited if they kept wall running and double jumping..... it’d be like titan fall but with the added charisma of apex
https://youtu.be/rR8wIy7OSEw
Was really hoping for a path skin this time around
Prob bestest event ever
Anyone else like the Wraith Witch?
我想吃汉堡
The recolors are clean af!
Crypto Halloween skin? Yes? No? Maybe?
Anyone else concerned about buying recolored skins? Really thought they would give my girl lifeline a legendary this year....
Haha DOPE.
The Skin‘s are from last year... only Color change now.. wow🤣..
But like, wallrunning is only for Shadows lmao
I better not have to pay for "recolored" skins... Please be L coins!
大手の人だらけで草
Im still gonna quit after i die 😏
Am i the only one getting cod vibes when they mentioned wall run
最初KI○○HOかと思った
クリプトさんはどこ…ここ？
I just wanna be shadow the whole time... I wanna be playing titan fall in apex
0:25 I’m genuinely convinced that their aim was literally worse than Hitler
YES!!!!!!
BADASS!!!
Dear Apex, please bring back the YoungBlood Bloodhound skin.
Don't rerealeas my skins🤣😭😭😭😭
yo which legend is at 0:20?
I miss wall running in a respawn game lol
Hol up, IMMA HAVE TO KILL MORE IMC GRUNTS?!
Apex twitter: gets toxic replys Apex youtube: happy little trees :>
Normal players: They're adding wallrun?!    Tf2 veterans: First time?
og's should get styles that look like shadows
AYYYYYYYYYY ITS BACK LETS GO BOIS
おぉー！壁走っとるがなぁー！
0:54 my main gets bomb skins once again
This game is DEAD in Australia. Even with cross play the servers are empty and you can hardly find a match. What a flop.
Ooof rev on rev violence
THERES FUCKING WALLRUNNING WHAT IF THIS IS A TEST TO SEE IF PEOPLE LIKE ADVANCED MOVEMENT ENOUGH FOR A TITANFALL 3
Me: oh that skin looks so good. I'm def getting it My wallet:        don't hink so
イベント終わったばっかりなのに笑笑
I wonder if you go revenant u can mess with shadows while being a shadow
What if, and this might sound a little crazy, we keep wallrun?
EXCUSE ME WALL RUNNING
2 days can't wait to get the skins I been waiting to get since the first Halloween event
Insane 👌👌
loba's tactical actually working in this trailer, hella fake.
Aahhhhh, Finally... My Favorite event is BACK!!!!
Still nothing for crypto 🙄
the revive is the coolest part
Apex: Brings Halloween event back. Overwatch players: *vietnam flashbacks
This is cool and all, but please fix bloodhounds footsteps.
والله جبار🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS YES YES YE YESSSSS
Revenant better have some voice lines arguing with his other self
Soooo epic an soooo pumped!!!!! Yes!!!
Did I saw wallruning and double jumping like titanfall 2. Imma wait till the next legend comes out.

I think they should buff octane with the ability to wallrun
FIGHT OR FRIGHT IS BACK!!!!!!
Oh shit here we go again
I don't do this for fame or glory I do it for fun.
Call of duty apex fortnite your move
I am beautiful
YASSSSSSSSS
So we getting akimbo season 7 too?
Never realized the zombies in the crates at IMC grunts, cool
Looks like THE PK IS BACK
Old skins from past holidays should not be brought back. Make new ones.
I am so excited!!!
え？壁走追加されてるな🤔こりゃー面白くなりそう
I don't really like Apex Legends at all, but holy fuck those skins are amazing!
高いよ
WoooooW it’s been a year already!! Man time flies next up it’s the Christmas 🎄train!! 🤗
Dang that caustic skin is insane looking
Everyone: OMG WALL RUNNING  Me: They put double jumping in apex didn't they
Yes this is my favorite event I'm starting to get back into apex but this is definitely gonna bring me back. yes I just noticed wall running definitely best game mode!
apex is the best
Wall run
god damn! that Revenant voice acting's on point <3 <3
Guess I won’t be doing my school work for a little while
Us Titan fall  players have been WAITING for this
OMG I LOVE THIS EVENT THE MOST!!! AND ITS ACTUALLY START ON MY BIRTHDAY(I' AM NOT JOKING ITS ACTUALLY ON MY BIRTHDAY) YESS!!!!
1:00 YOU PICKED THE WRONG HOUSE FOOL!
That Bloodhound skin (0_0)      *Sad broke boi noises*
Yes yes yes yes yes! REVENANTS TIME TO SHINE ON HALLOWEEN IS BACK BABY!!!! 🤩🤩😋😋😀😃
As much as I want to get this stuff, I have no money to get it...Ill just look at it and wave :(
Wall running: exist Me: I call upon the ancient titanfall skills to awaken awaken awaken awaken.
YES!!!!!!!!!
666 dislikes :0
I'm so hyped for this but my wallet isn't
Pay more for the same but it’s new cause it’s a different color right?
My timbers have shivered
Where's my wallet? WHERE'S MY WALLET?!?
I can’t wait to walk on walls like in BO3
If those revamped skins let me use that red currency if I already own the originals then I'll be one happy camper
Please have night world's Edge please.
Check out the loba ring teleport. She didnt get animation locked after landing!
WOW
Who is the dude in the supply bin anyway
YOOOOO
Oh no they finally brought it in.... 🤯 Wall running
That wallrunning is triggering my titanfall ptsd, now whenever I hear a spitfire ill just freak out and close the game
КТО РУССКИЙ ЛАЙК)
respawn is running my pockets hard
Wow I am amazed this is just so epic
ハロウィンレイスもしかして！？
It will be a crime if no revenant skin is in this event
Loba didnt even get a new skin that is not a recolour. That outfit in the trailer is a basic recolour she has since release.
20 bomb badges for everyone lol
神
I feel most alive when rapidly approaching new game modes.
WALLRUNNING. WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR
Made me cry let’s go
Tfw that LTM in Titanfall 2 where they increased the health has been training you for this moment.
Wtf the skins
Ogs will know the first one😂😂
ah shit, here we go again
Why y'all leaving Bangalore out of these trailers all the time?!
so this looks like a genuinely all around great event
it's like titanfalllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
HOLY SHITTTT
Please bring back the R99
SHADOW FALL is BACK BABY!!! 💀🎃🤩😱🤯
I really hope that’s a Loba buff and not just editing
Imagine having Pathfinder in your trailer to promote how you're against people gaining skills and punishing them for doing so
Respawn? why are u doing this to me?! i didn't have time to save up on crafting medals. can we have at least on free skin?
*EA: does a new event with new overpriced skins.* Also EA: *I SMELL PENNIIIES!* 💲💲💲
きたああああああっ！！！
OKAY BUT THE WALL RUNNING
壁走りｨｨｨｨｨｨｨｨ!!!!
This looks interesting.
Yo apex my game says invalid token and doenut allow me to play can you please fix it my user name is ahmedmuhammad95 please I need to fi ish my battle pass
These assholes decided to make some skins 40 bucks bc they don’t sell separately. I’m too triggered.
Okay but when are we getting the Season 7 Trailer??
LMAO THEY JUST COPIED FROM WARZONE
It's a recolour event
Please tell me theres gonna be new finisher for Revenant. Also I wish that they'll make a Naruto like exclusive reskin for Crypto. Just throwing that in there if it ever cross somebody's eye...
Wall running now!?!?!
So octane is getting wallrunning? Because the shadows double jumped after they jumped off the wall.
Yessssss it’s back😁😁
Titanfall 2 veterans, rise up!
Wtf es muy bueno
Wall runing :D
Octane need some love with a Halloween suit
عربي عربيه يصف معي 🙌
I just came a little
This is a really cool event but the after market event just came back it would probably be a better idea if you held this back later after Halloween because alot of players just spent money and most likely wont be getting much anytime soon
I’m just saying this because of the overwhelming amount of stupidity: only shadows can wallrun. The devs literally said this on reddit. They were never going to let a legend wallrun, but for one event they’d allow it.
I love Alex but. This look like a downgrade version of MwBr🤭🤭
YEAHHH
My account is banned  so i cant play 😢😢😠😠
Who do I have to... ahem... bribe to get the cowboy mirage skin back?
Yes
0:40 - loba just used her tactical and it was really quick. I don’t think that they just skipped the animation for the trailer. Loba buff?!
Can you quit updating on school days   Please
THAT IS SOOOO COOOL
Nice no ones gonna talk about how loba’s end animation got shortened
Recolored skins from last year? Lmaooo
Cancel this crossplay horse shit. It shouldn't be the default at least.
Like it but why are u releasing re colored skins from last year
0:20 that's a grunt from Titanfall. Why is no one else talking about this?
I can finally enjoy apex again
Im cant wait! Gonna play this and shit my pants once again!
Calm down babies, this is skin party  ONLY for donations players, there is no way to got something good
All around me all I see is familiar faces
so is this like last years one but with squads??
Esperaba nuevas skins -.-
Lol I was kind excepting a revenat heriloom
OH MY GOSH WERE IN THE SHADOW REALM BOYSSSSS
Trash
Can we get the revenant heirloom with the revenant event please?
Octane should be able to wall run
Titan Fall Titan Fall
I should of known they kept all the good Halloween skins for round/year 2
So  instead of giving us new skins they gives us the old ones with a color change yeah no thanks
Oh boi can't wait
Kinda trash we getting the same skins again 🤦🏽‍♂️
If there brining back all the old events I can't wait for the Christmas one, where you had to capture the train oooooo it's gonna be so cool
Wait, they running on walls? This illegal
I would’ve been more excited if it’s not going to be behind a big paywall
So instead of an evac ship it’s just last survivor standing wins
https://youtu.be/EEPNZPffY-g
The first event : *people dies and disconnect when shadows* This event : *People kill themselves just for W A L L R U N*
Every halloween event is epic Good job apex
He killed himself the epic way
Im so hyped about this....👻👻
Can I say thet we hét titenfall movememt FINNELY ?!
as a titan fall player, I am getting PTSD from this
BEST TRAILER IVE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can’t even play apex. got my PS4 taken away. 2 more days..
Its too boring this event seems like last year....try worlds edge in the dark for this event..why kings canyon again....its SO BORINGGGGGG
the thought of titanfall vets coming to apex with this event reminds me of that one comic on reddit where the legends meet a single pilot with a kraber and get annihalated
is invalid_token still intact?
We can now revie while being a zombie and that bloodhound skin I’m getting it
Damn, Revenant said “Bitch how they live, nah you coming back.”
Wallrunning: *exists* Titanfall veterans: you guys are sooo screwed
New octane buff should be wall run
wait that's coming out tmr holy shit content flood bros
Nintendo switch?
*Titanfall 2 vibes intensify*
Epic like epic games
Man I’m gonna miss the shadowfall game mode tho
WALLRUNNING!
As a titanfall vet, I'm actually disappointed to see wall running in here. Not because I hate it or anything, but because I don't know, it just doesn't feel right. If they do add a pilot in this game, then ok, but why? I do know apex is in the titanfall universe though. Also, I like how a lot of people are making memes saying stuff like "Titanfall vets after seeing wall run", but I've see a lot of titanfall players hate apex. I don't know why. I'm don't like apex, nor do I dislike it. I just play it for fun. But if you go on titanfall videos, and there's a comment about apex, then oh boy, get ready for a war. And by "a lot" of titanfall players, I mean like only 30% of the players, which isn't a lot. Probably only 200-300 people. Anyways, Respawn, if you're reading this, and are adding a pilot to the game....    Make it so you can one punch everyone like in titanfall 2.
When is apex coming to switch 😞
1:11 Is rev getting a new finisher?
Memors I remember season 3
Fright Event Font?
The octane skin is going to be again?
最後やられるんかーい
Respawn wants to make titanfall 3
Ok this is epic
BRUH I WAS LOWKEY GONNA STOP PLAYING IF THIS MODE DIDNT COME OUT WOULDN'T FEEL LIKE A GOOD HALOWEEN WITHOUT IT (IM FUCKING PUMPED BROOOO)
FUCKIN GIVE REVANANT A GRIM REAPER SKIN!!!!
0:59 ayo was that the minecraft zombie in the background 💀💀💀
In 2 days :D
OMG!! On Kings Canyon!! AGAIN!!
Is it still coming out tho
When the shadows run like TitanFall characters    TitanFall fans 0.0
So these skins get recolors so you know who is og and who isn’t  but wraiths event skin doesn’t k ........
А эти скины за 2400 металлов можно будет собрать?
In 0:25 there is no ammo counter in flatline Perhaps infinite ammo?
As a titanfall player, respawn is making a very nice choice.
The new titanfall event looks amazing
Love the re skins u honestly out did your self  and the same game mode perfect.I rather spend money on V bucks
Apex players: New shadow rules!! Pilots: *w a l l r u n n i n g* ... Titanfall 3 confirmed
I can't wait to wall run on enemies with that old town mirage skin, my first mirage legendary event skin.._.Leezz goooooouuuu cowboy!!
WALL RUNNINGGGG 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Wall running and double jump, it’s beautiful
The new recolors 🤩🤩
They can wall run
"That's what we've been waiting for!"  "It's what we wanted all along!"
When an apex predator sees apex "legends" wallrunning: *Game on*
So you’re saying.... I can upgrade my caustic clown skin from last year....? SO EXCITED!!!
You know whats funny? Even in trailers there is no hit reg!  0:25 Fix your damn servers!
WHERE IS SOLO MODE?
Przybyłem zobaczyłem i sie podnieciłem
Oh yeah
Recycled skins  But the recolor ain't that bad
1:14  “Hol’ up”
Can loba get a good skin
Uhhh it’s snowing here, where’s my Christmas event?
How long will the event last?
I hope it goes buy for crafting metals
Love that they made recolours, hope there is some new stuff. Cant wait for the gamemode 😊
FFS, make Titanfall 3, stop teasong us with the wall running!  Edit: How did you fuck up wallrunning this bad, YOU MADE TITANFALL. Stop developing this shit game and make Titanfall 3, an actual good game
my hype died when i knew skins cost  apex coins and no way to get them with crafting matriels
Was that wall running I saw😨😨😨😨😨
No bangy love again!? Cmon man!
Rampage scary
PK back ohhhh boi
Kngs Canyon...! Again...
new Revanent buff? Wallrunninh 😅
I’m ready for people to get pissed about the recolors
i like this a lot, though i really enjoyed the intensity of the one from last year. It was some of the most fun i've had in this game.
🤤♥️😍
Me when i see fight or fright back: your as beautiful as the day i lost you
Didn't we have this event last year ? Copy and paste ig.
As usual nothing new on Bang LuL
This is insaneeeeeed🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I already spent 50 dollars on skins in the flashpoint event, I am not going to spend more money ... am I?
Guys I’m the only one be hyped that the pk is coming back ?
Can’t freaking wait
Hey respawn lets bring back the pk to the ground hahahah ty
Only og will know
Please don‘t forget about bangalore
I can't freaking wait I've always wanted that bloodhounds skin I never got to play the Frightfight mode
Hiyp train is what I ment to say
0:19 Anyone see this!? What's this monster!?
Dude I can wait to get some skins
I was excited and ready to drop some money on the event because i missed out last time and love this time of year but they lost their fucking mind with how they priced the cosmetics. SMFH. They just lost out on a $100 bomb from me . They are basically doubling the price like they are including the recolors as a whole ass skin on top of that everything is bundled and you cant choose the skins you want without getting something you dont want. TO obtain all the featured skins will cost you $230 USD. Fuck outta here.
Yeah, that cool and all but bitch give us titnfall 3
I’m buying the octane skin cuz ima hardcore octane main 1000+
They could’ve at least gave everyone new skins and not just re colours
Me: *played Titanfall 1 & 2* *sees wall running* IT'S BEEN 84YEARS..!
esta priti apex lo boto el que no le gusto puse no le gusta el que si le gusta es a Jacknavy 507 sigalo el que gusta apex que me de lay
It’s S P O O K Y time
Oh yeah, it's all coming together.  We have the Volt, Stim, and now Wallrunning. All we need now is our titans.  Titanfall and Titanfall 2 vets rise up!
Can we have an bow for the apex or something
Go to hell EA if you cannot provide proper servers just delete this game from internet completely
Plzzzz respawn some how implement a wall run or mobility system into apex plzzzzzz respawn plzz
The skins are a disappointment.
Wallet: “Cmon man. They just got an event like two weeks ago. You really bout to throw me out to the wolf’s again?”  Me:  . . . . . Maybe. . . .
Apex Legends I know you  probably wont read this comment but that clown caustic skin is by far one of my favorite skins on apex! I wish I had it, the skin designers are getting better and better.
Im playing this just so i can use the tf2 movement
PLEASE a pilot wall running legend would be amazing
Pls something for lifeline
Oh boy recolors of the same old skins
So gaaaaaaaaaay  Except for Revenant
so nobody gonna mention :20 sec in? what character is that?
Is there a way I can make some money so I can get everything when this drops my paycheck isn’t until from 2 more weeks from here
Hold up, is it only shadows that can wall run? If not and its implemented into thr regular modes then this is a game changer
Where the pathfinder skins at :(
Crypto never gets any love
Am i the only one that thinks 00:20 is a teaser
The new wrath recollor is better than the original
Never in my life have i used finisher on a same legend..woww
Are there finally new finishers??
My friend says that this wall run is more from fallenorder than from titanfall prove him wrong please
Almost spent $150 on coins for the stupid hammer that I never got because there's 3 items not unlocked and now this event. What a  scam😠
Respawn: So here's this really cool Halloween event where your dead squadmates revive as shadows until everyone's de-  *Players: W A L L R U N*
So does this mean you're just going to recycle the Christmas skins again? Seems lazy at this point. Ngl I was really looking forward to the halloween event and skins this year and I'm not impressed.
finally loba representation but you didn’t even feature her (already leaked) halloween skin..... why do you hate her so much
I haven’t played since Season 5
The single player was such ASS. Glad they made it team based this time around.
This...looks...amazing! Warzone may have their super sweet, ultr slick gunplay, but Apex got that dope ass movement and  W A L L R U N N I N G.
WHERE IS THE HEIRLOOM
Please support mouse and keyboard  on console 🙏🏼
I   S E E   W A L L R U N N I N G ! ! !
is it hard to make different skins instead of recolors? , i love the game but not having skins or events too often will make me step aside
Dat path skin though 🦾
hell yes
Finally not a collection event for once
0:20 Is that a grunt Zombie i see?
Everyone's so hyped about wallrun, meanwhile I'm here wondering "will Sheila be taken off ramparts back as a shadow or will it become a shadow minigun"
Evwryone gangsta till a cloen whit a sledge hammer runs at you
How big is the game?
Im curious but yal think that hemlock skin will come back?
0:20 what's this?
Oh my god the wall run
Yoooo 2020 is saved! I knew hiding my wallet from the aftermath event was worth it!
Carai tô mt ansioso
HOLA GENTE Y GENTA SOY . .. ... .... ..... ...... ....... ........ ......... ..........
YES! But why does the Caustic Skins have to be bundled and $40?? You guys should add tough challenges that reward some of the event skins or packs. I would play a lot more if that was a thing.
DUUUUUDE WERE THOSE SHADOWS WALL RUNNING!?!?!? 😱😱😱
My wallet is screaming
Anyone else think Octane needs a buff??
REVENANT : I WANT YOU HEART
Dissapointed
they are all just re colors nothing new pretty disappointing  and why claim "exclusive" when you just bring them back again for all the people that cry about it obviously money is more important than keeping their word
Stand by for Titan fall I love the event
Notice they didnt show any new legendaries
BRO THAT'S EPIC! It's so freaking scary to see the shadows wallrunning when you remember how powerful they were last time the way I remember. *shudder* I look Forward to this
is the octane skin at 0:23 coming back?
FINALLY! You acknowledge that I exist...
Unfortunately need to wait a week to get back Winged Menace on my pc account... it'll be worth the wait though 🥰
Wow
anyone notice the rev finisher?
Nice, some more PVE content
Ooooo
epic
Who is Titan Fall
Could this be apex testing wall running as an in game feature
How they should buff mirage is to make him a recon class. This means every time an enemy shoots his decoy, they get scanned. He could also use survey beacons. This would make him better in my opinion.
0:31 wait- did lifeline just fucking possess loba😳😳😨
solo dire por que no tengo  dinerooo aaaa
Me: getting hyped for the event Also me: Yo where the lifeline recolor at tho?
Mirage cowboy custom?
Hmmmmmmmmmm its looks like titanfall 2 0:26
Played since game was online...stopped 2months ago and will never rejoin back..
reminded of titan fall again
Me when I’m banned for a month : .......
This looks so fun. No cap
OMG
They got real lazy with the skins in this event
TITANFALL INCOMING
No one talking about the event only being 10 days long?
Stand by for titanfall I guess  Shadows be pilots now
Настолько обленились, что даже скинов новых не хотят занести
apex could you make this 2 days longer plz
OOOH NO, THE SHADOWS ARE SPEEDRUNNING THE APEX GAMES!
letsttstss gokooooooooo
As a titanfall 2 player I have already mastered the wall run
Well I know what I am going to re-download now
What about the prince of darkness
Can respawn just leave ea?ea is literally bringing the game down due to the  OVERPRICES skins I was really excited for this event just to find out I have to pay 6000 just for a couple of skins which is like £50 for me
It is coming back am ready for you all player,s ready or not here we come for you...
Apex: Hey y'all want the same skins but a lil different? Us: Yea
All this for a revenant skin that looks like ass.
Lol
WHO'S THAT AT 0:21 ??
It looks great but why every video Bangalore don’t get anything can I get a like from all the bang mains plz she needs some love....
酔っ払ってます！
0:44 oh loba🤣
WTF...... (some video link)   why are there bots everywhere here
I’m sad Pathfinder is not dressed up as Octane legs (Ref to the trailer of the last year event)
what time does it drop ?
WE GET TITANFALL MOVEMENT!?!?!!!!!??
So.. if i want only a skin i must pay the others 4??? The event is nice but the prices.. emmmm.. u know, EA..
kinda sad the skins are just recolors...
This will be fun with the bois
Everyone: Wallrun   Me in gibbys voice: i miss thunderdome
Spooky apex!!!!!!
Boop
Yooo they making us titanfall players so powerful with wall running
Brutal.
Shadow Rev: You're weak Revenant: Shut it skinsuit
here we go titan fall wall walking jutsu yechnique
R we getting patch notes?
Yooo we got the Darth Maul gibi skin
if jack cooper is here im playing till my liver shuts down
So instead of a new mirage skin, we're getting a recolor cowboy skin?
Wallrinning?? Let’s go!!!!
عجب زیباست
Me a Titanfall 2 player seeing the ability to wall run: my time has come
WALLRUN WALLRUN WALLRUN WALLRUN WALLRUN WALLRUN WALLRUN WALLRUN WALLRUN WALLRUN WALLRUN WALLRUN
YOO SKULL TOWN
んなもんより戦闘中の足音聞こえないの何とかしろやマヌケが
Does anyone even play Apex Legends now..😅
The comments are proof enough that they need to add wall run in some form in perm game
so i'm really gonna have to buy that wraith skin AGAIN?
those titanfall gauntlet grinders are gonna have some fun
Que padre :00000
https://youtu.be/MFc1qxNhZ_Q
This event was so fun back in season 2
Love the ending quote from Revenant
Ultron: Whatever doesn't kill me... 2nd Ultron: ...Just makes me stronger 1:11
My brain when I saw wall running in apex:    Gaksjfisksjdhrbtbdjjskanshsjejbdejosjsjsjejsjxjcjjdnejwiqoqponrvtvtjeosjxbrbeiaopqpwnszbbccbjfirhebsvaonxbcjoeoqksbbddueiowowpadjbduwofdfhgddvhhsssddcvjkpoteqqdxcvbkiufffccvvbhhjjkkggcvv Brain.exe is not responding
Apex releases a new event Me to my wallet: I can’t wait to get my hands on you
why the fuck does wallrunning come as an event
Seriously? Revenant didnt get a Halloween skin? Wooooooow.
My eyes: OK. They added wallrunning My heart: STAND BY FOR TITANFALL.
Damn I was super hyped for the halloween event this year then to find out the cosmetics are just recolored skins from last years event🙄😴🙄.... truly disappointed
REV UP YOUR EDGEHOPPING, G BOOSTING, AIRSTRAFING PILOTS!! OUR TIME HAS COME
WALL RUN IN APEX??? *Titanfall vibes*
This trailer is fuckin lit🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wall running let’s goooo!!!
You can Wall Run!!!!!! Yes! Finally!!
Am I the only one who though Flashpoint was insanely difficult? I played it almost every day trying to get the 10 wins badge but only got to 4
Plz crossover with payday and give revanent a cloalwr skin
“shadows can wall run”  titanfall veteran: our time has come
Apex≒TITAN FALL3 good
Dear EA, I sincerely hope you'll read this for I think I am speaking for many with this suggestion. But first, let me tell you a story, it is the story of a fellow player, a player who likes the game, he likes it and he plays it, and he plays so much that he gets to the point where he possesses 4 legendary items and 5 additional legends. But this poor player does not own the legend "Octane" and guess what? All of those 4 legendary items are for "Octane", now I think I've made it pretty clear that this player is me and I feel that having obtained these legendary items I should be able to benefit from them, because even if I did own "Octane" I would not use it. My proposal is for players to be able to exchange legendary items for "Crafting Materials", not 1200 of course, then finding legendary items would be useless but perhaps a much lower number such as 600 or more, I feel like being able to exchange items for half their price in "Crafting Materials" would be an enriching additionally feature. Hope you'll consider my proposal, A fellow player
Ok but is it gonna be for the worlds edge map as well? Bc that'd be intense af
Titan fall 3 confirmed
lmao re coloured skins
So apex is too lazy to make new skins ?!?!
I thought for sure i seen a titan fall pilot being exicuted but no. To my dissapointment it was just caustics skin
Wait loba is a bad guy
Cheers for  respawn
La neta no estuvo bueno.
Did i jus see wall running?
Edgy rev making suicide jokes.
Honestly gonna purposefully die just so I can wallrun LOOL
Revenant: Wants to be killed     Also Revenant: “If you want something done right you’ve got not do it yourself”
Did anyone else see the shadow wall running!? If shadows get to wall run I’m going to kamikaze every fight just to be a shadow
I lose a fucking battle pass for a pack at the past event, i got a bad skin and the package its so expensive
Ah shit here we go again
It is time, my pilot brothers and sisters.  Time to style on these kids that have never played Titanfall.  Heh...haha.......HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA!!!!!!!!   If they ever add a character that can wall run....I can only imagine
PK BACK BOYSS!!!!!!!!
My xbox live just got expired and i am broke :/
This guy has such a blood lust he even lusts for his own blood
As i look at my wallet sorry old friend
Yes I'm been waiting for so long
i love how the second gibby skin looks like a thicc dark maul
Alk my titanfall homie’s
Running on walls ...i main octane now :D
Pilot, your Titan is ready.   .... Standby for Titanfall.
RIP to all the players who spent their money on the aftermarket event.
Apex on Steam and Linux PLEASE
Двойные прыжки и бег по стенам,пооооог Титанфол,Я скучал
Wait,Wait, My Wallet still needs to recover
Are these....full price reskinned cosmetics?
When is it coming to switch
i feel boring . are u ?
This is cool, but can y’all fix all the audio issues
fate didn't bring me back wall running did
Skin swapping skins lol. At least ya tried
Looks cool but where's the revenant cosmetic
They dont think loba teleport animation is too long?
I can't say the emotions I felt seeing a wallrun animation in an Apex trailer
Goddamn I knew it.. they're gonna add different color sets to already existing skins.
I love
Now just lower that TTK
So u guys finaly made the wallrun
Coming on my birthday.
The event coming in my birthday!
Yesssss I've been waiting for this
YES TITANFALL TWO MECHANICS IN APEX AHAHHHHAA REWSPAWN HAVE MY BABIES
Ohhhoooooo Wall run finally coming to Apex!
0:37 Is it just me or was that a faster Loba animation.
I was having a bad day to day but apex legends made my day 20x better
Might just be for the trailer but Loba tp is faster (the bit where she appears at her location) so maybe a buff??
Bacan
Wow
Im just happy i can run on walls in true  titanfall style
yo is that free octane skin coming back i love it and im an octane main
Finally our sweet titanfall 2 wallrun tech is finally in the game! So pumped for this event, im sure theyre using this as a test, please make it permanent!! thank you respawn !
Please if there's no Pilot Legend make it so in the near future everyone can run on walls
PLEASE BRING HOLO DAY BASH BACK PLEASE I DIDNT GET TO PLAY IT MUCH I REALLY WANT IT BACK IN THE GAME😁
Let's just forget all about Crypto and his vampire outfit alternate its all good.
Letsssss goooooooooooooooo
They should've released caustic heirloom in this event, but EA would've said "hey!, nobody would spend money on aftermarket event so let's put a heirloom In there with some crappy skins and save all the good skins for the Halloween event, so people spend and we get money on both events, cause F our consumers"
Wall Running .. 100% conforming the new legends ability
TITANFALL 2 MOVEMENT
Aw no new skins
come on make the wall runnin  in the  gameplay
Gay!
All players: discussing wall runs.   Me, one of the few with godlike aim on pc: well... time to get reported with aim hacking lmao...   There's a reason wall runs doesn't work in apex lads 😂
Respawn: lets just recolor all the skins from last year people loved them.  Me: take my money and leave me alone
BROOO THE WALL RUNNINGGGG
Bro we can walk run now! Just like in Titanfall 2!
А эти скины за металлы можно будет собрать?
Funny how warzone stole apex Halloween event lol smh
Is there a new mirage re-color for his cowboy costume?
Getting pretty annoyed with this half-assed, recycled content/ money grab.
If you think I'm going to pay full price just for a recoloring of a skin, you are out your mind!
Wall running!!!
HOLY CRAAAAP CONTENTTTTTT AAAAAAAA
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
YES!!! I’ve missed this
If every thing wasnt so expensive I could buy something
So we just gonna ignore the dead Titan fall Marine in the supply bin????
Same as last year... Recolor Skins 20€.. Wow we can run on the walls... Thx Titanfall...
i fucking miss R99
Oh whats this? The same zombie game for the survival-  Shadows:*Literally pilot wallruns*  *P O G*
Could you fix the game audio first before adding new events and shit, you guys trippin!
I want apex for switch D’:
Y'all always forget Wattson. Also this is cool and all but what about the other legends? The new ones don't have anything new
Time to do some trick hits with this wall run just like the good ol days
WALL RUNNING
when your grounded so you can't even play it HAAAAAAHAHAHAH
Kings canyon again ? :/
Wall running as shadows
I like how both revenants have slightly different pitches in their voices, showing how they're the same but different at the same time.
Man shadow rev didn't give a fuck
0:26 wtf is this, don't tell me it's wall running ?
Wall running
I have been fascinated by this mode for a year last halloween <3 Please do not delete it is super fun !!! 😍
Really?? Same skin??? Just a different colors??
Best game ever
Omg to early im happy
Game sucks now
Love how we keep coming back to this dumb map... everyone clearly wants worlds edge after dark
Me and the rest of Titanfall vets are rolling in.
Wall   Running       Nut
My credit card:Ambush ambush theirs another event!
The hound skin though 😳
To all Titanfall Veterans: "Our Time has Come...!"
Loba thicc
Lets show these Legends how the 6-4 does it!!
right on pay day
WALL RUNNING!!! LEZGOO
Apex players who haven’t played Titanfall if you like the wall running (when the event launches) get Titanfall if you want more
is the best event of apex legends
Another episode of: Why do they hate Bangalore?
Im so hyped this was like the good old days for me
I LOVE apex keep up the work
more legendary skins for every other character except for loba :(
Same skins? Bro respawn it's a big ass joke
По кайфу))
They kinda cheaped out on the skins ngl
soooooooooooooooooo we just gonna skip over the fact that EA literally is just gonna sell re skins of an exclusive event and call it new LMFAO
Legendary👏🏽
lo mismo pero mas barato
F**k'n wall running in Apex legends. 2020 turning around
As far as free games go, this probably is one of the most high quality games for the buck, if you think about it is
Shadows were hard to run from during the last shadow event. I can't imagine how hard it's going to be with them wall running in super jumping.
YEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Can we all agree that the introduction is the coolest thing we've ever seen?
Looks soooo cool but please tell me that you add the new colored skin and not the og ones (I bought Bloodhound skin last year and felt so unique with it) please...
Еееее а где мобайл
So, we can now hope that people will remain in game, right? As we're in squads now, instead of being 1 v 1 v  all? Nice!
*Gen X pilots have joined the lobby*
Titan fall fans, admit you were screaming when you saw the wall running shadows
When revenant doesn’t get a skin because he is scary enough
Look this time we can play revenant lol
Rip of wraiths
Where’s dat lifeline skin tho
Can we get an event on Worlds Edge PLEASE
Everyone: Ooo wall running, new skins, and more! Me: Wow if last seasons Fight Or Fright event was canon I wonder if this will be canon too and what’s the story of why they’re there?
Is that a new finisher? 1:11
We got zombie versions of grunts from Tf2 and wall/ double jump physics from Tf2, dose this mean...       Jack Cooper?
Apex: *Gives every one A cool skin* Octane: *am I a joke too u*
Wall running       Finally
1:12 Revenant's 3rd Execution?!!
Will this game became titan fall 2?
My favourite game ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yass. Spooky time, gamers
Ayyo
FUCKING WALLRUN!!
Yoo at 0:21 theres an imc grunt but its a zombie i think if you have played titanfall you will undertsand
Finally 🔥🔥🔥💀
Anybody know if the skins can be crafted?
I fucking jumped when I saw them wall run, this is gonna be hella fun
Remember when we didn't know the voice of this event was gonna be a Legend?
October 22nd? Apex take my money now!!
maybe this is the 473th time I clutch up the gulag today lol
I think rev got a new finisher
Reverant killing himself????? Seems logical to me
Revenent 1:who are u Revenent 2:I’m u but stronger
wall run yeeeeessss!!!!!!!!!
El bromas
Pretty great how all they did was recolor skins from last year... lazy AF if you ask me....
Recycled content lets go
Oh boy here we go again
OR AT LEAST ADD THEM
PLEASE ADD A TRAILER FOR MOBILE PLAYERS
I can’t wait to grab the Caustic heirloom and smack some shadow’s faces in
GOOD
just me or does those event seem kind of lazy?
Recolors!? Ewwww. Big missed opportunity for new Halloween skins! #NotMyApexLegends
The same skins I have all them it’s Halloween who use the same costume the next year now everyone is going to have  skins you thought were rare
seems  relaxing
This is exactly what i been waiting For this EXACTLY EXACTLY what i have been waiting For
Still no Revenant Anubis skin though
0:03-0:17-When you visit your quiet friend
DAMN
前回のハロウィンイベからもう一年かよ早えわ
Revs event but no cool rev skin? RIP. Still hyped tho
Please turn down the prices of skins
you guys still have problems for pc crashing 😭🤣
yay can you do it every Halloween
Where is wattson skin?!!
Apex legends PLEASE 😞🥺🥺🥺🥺🧡🧡🧡🧡💜💜💜 Add watson heirloom pleseeeee
Ash would make the coolest “pilot” legend, can we be real?? Her passive can be wall running and maybe faster wall climbing. Her ultimate can be her ronin titan. Her ability can be some sort of “pet” (like hound dogs kinda deal). And her heirloom can EASILY be her katana. Done and done ✅
The way shadows are sliding through walls is that a little tease on the new season 7 event or I'm just way ahead of my self.
*Don’t let the wall running distract you from this being a copy and paste event, not even Halloween skins for new legends smh* 🤦🏽‍♂️ 😑😒😞😕 come on RESPAWN, copy and pasting Christmas too? Same skins & train event too?
Oh my god the wall riding😫 this game is about to get WACK   Pilot legend confirmed?!
It’s crazy this stuff is canon
Yes I wanted this for so long
One of the best apex modes is back 🚨🏃🏻‍♂️
Here is just a question will they be doing skin trading?
Damn was really looking forward to new skins. Not reskined ones like we get every week
*intense dooting*
PILOT I DETECT ENEMY FORCES, SMART CORE READY
Rev heirloom?
1:10 New Revenant Finisher?
Another recicled event with literally nothing new, how exciting.
I honestly think they should make a game mode we’re we are able to wall run or they should just emolument that into the actual game
This year goodbye to the skins of this event, prices exaggerated here in Mexico :'( like stop the prices fall
Ready for my game again skin suits?...
How Much You Wanna Bet, Horizon's Passive Will Be Wall Running?
Those reskins are terrifying
The most hype thing about this trailer is the wall running
So glad to see wallrunning added right after I got Titanfall 2. Can't wait to flex on people with my newbie wallrunning skills.
wait wall run they add wall run FINALLY
ON MY BIRTHDAY!!!
Wall run looks pretty good
i cant not hear samuel hayden whenever revenant talks
Titanfall
My boy octane still not getting his own spooky legendary
PK PK PK PK PK PK PK PK
WALLRUNNING LET'S GOOOO
YOO THE BLOODHOUND SKIN
1980
THEY ADDED WALL RUNNING YESSS
This is just sad, not only are they not making new skins, but their just re releasing old ones and re coloring them
It's meh but I'm down for it
0:41 - 0:45 - It's Beautiful I've Looked At This For Five Hours Now
I just bought quarantine 722 for wraith
I wasted my money
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes I didn’t get to play last years so I’m so exited
Too bad it’s reskins
is anyone gonna talk about skull town coming back
me: 👀  wallet: *cries in Aftermarket event*
so a bunch of recolours then ?
WE RUNNING ON FALLS AGAIN?!
Çok iyi good
apex fans: WE CAN WALL RUN NOW!? titan fall 2: am I a joke to you?
Nice, very nice 👌
Bangalore skin.... Where is the recolor?
It just looks like they changed the colors of the old Halloween skins that’s bs
Wait no, I want the old version back please
W A L L R U N
Me: about to play titanfall 2  Apex: how bout nah
Ban strikepacks and problems on apex and then give us content youre game is dying and you do anything for...
Y did revenant kill himself?
Me seeing trailer: ...... Me seeing Imc Grunt: Oh shit   Me seeing Wall Running:Ooooooooooooh Ooooooooooooh
Y'all better not be Camping either! I'll see you on the battle field👹
I'm just glad the older cosmetics are coming back. I've been playing since Season 01 (But didn't truly get into it until Season 03) and I missed out on Old Town Mirage, which is one of the best skins for my main.
Where was the revenant skin at =_=
Espero y con eso reviva el juego
I’m really mad at apex,they said that there limited cosmetics may I repeat LIMITED when the og event was live I kinda felt pressured to buy a skin cause they were suppose to never come back and it feels good to have a limited skin.just WHY apex WHY
WALL RUN!
WHYD YOU BRING BACK YEEHAW MIRAGE?!?!?!??! He was rare you bastards
Broooo is this zombies? We should get a zombies lol
0:51 when i see my teammate looting my other teamates death box👿✊
A few thousand of you or so gotta be bullshitting. If we have this many players claiming they play titanfall then explain how the game struggles to even find players?
Who gets the heirloom
Hello there
You see caustic clownass running to get your ass is scary enough now that I've seen him in a shadow with his clownass cosmetics im bout to have nightmares
What happened to steam?
0:27 AIMBOT!!
This trailer is really cool
Sick! Love apex legends. Best game in the world. Y’all can bet I’ll be playing all weekend.
They need to spend time on working on lifelines skin like they do on wraith and path I’m a lifeline main and I was disappointed in the ninja skin could have been better I couldn’t get the judge jury executioner when it came out last year but I’m just hoping they bring it back like the void Walker I won’t lose it this time
The problem about this event is if your random teammate dies he leaves
Sick! One of my favorite events. Also Cross Play is awesome. Please don't take it away :)
titanfall movement!!!!
I sense a great disturbance in my wallet
Esta arrechisimo buenísimo la verdad es el mejor evento asta ahora
Crypto: I wonder if she’ll be my Halloween partner  Caustic: hahahahaha
Bruh you guys are saying titan fall im getting cod 3 vibes
people still play this crap?
I have all halloween skins so oh well
Yeaaah I'll probably wait till next halloween cause they are the same skins just different colors guys I'll just one thousand apex pack an try to get legendarys or something lmao
Come back!?PeaceKeeper
Oww gol Is beutefull
Just me who noticed the loba buff? Ok...
If apex could actually make good original skins and not put out recolored recycled garbage. What a hot load of shit res pawn. Work harder or the games dead in 6 months
PILOTS THE WALL RUNNING IS HERE. EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN TRAILERS, THEY USE IT IN GAME AND FUTURE UPDATES. ALL PILOTS RISE
Respawn: let's put wall running for our players!  People who doesn't played Titanfall and CoD: why do I hear a boss cover?
Wait the peacekeeper was out of the CAREPACKGES
I feel most alive when rapidly seeing this comment!
So apex is slowly gonna just turn into titanfall 3. I’m ok with that.
WE CAN MAKE A JACK COOPER COSPLAY HEHEHEHHEHEHEHEHEH DELICIOUS
Me realizing that I spent money on the wrong event
0:27 only in apex
I wasn't playing Apex when this mode was out but knowing that it is back while always wanting to try out this mode is awesome :)
Please the creators of Apex legen add SSE support. I want to play strongly with friends, but I can't afford it, and through GeForce NOW  it is not convenient to play and time is bothering me please add
I only saw my peacekeeper at the endddd...pls comeee backkk my darling🥺🥺
WALL RUNNING
Me:Sees legends wall running Also me:Fk yeah this is a sign that we are gonna get Titanfall 3.
Hey champs, What's it with the TitanFall???
What *Wraith & Path nerfs* in this update?
anybody gonna talk about that mid-air jump after wall running at 0:42
OMG
I wanna see the ítem shop
Bro just wait until epic games buys apex and puts giant robots in.
@the 4th king jacorey msg.  Nah man, Everyone’s on gangster till you hear “Smart core, engaged” just around the corner.😂
Can this be on world edge? It's super glitchy on king canyon, it's a good map buts it's broken! I try to reach out to u guys but u won't listen!
Респаун не обижайтесь но почему у фанатов рекалор лучше чем у вас
I'm sorry I haven't been playing...school has just been 😔💔🥴
But which rev would win in a fight
0:26 yeeee boiiii wallrun
They clearly have the framework in place for wallrunning and jump boosting, so I think the next Legend will be Viper from Titanfall 2. I think he survived and there are subtle hints that have come from Ash that suggest he’s still in contact with her.  Edit: Obviously not the next legend, as it’s confirmed to be Horizon, but possible a new legend sometime down the line
No new Halloween skins all reskins that are going to cost 20$ trash 😤
When is a new MAP coming? SICK of same APEX being RECOLORED!.. same shit different texture. 18months already???
They should make the new legends passive wall running or double jumping
Don't put double jump pls noobs will spam the jump button
Ahhhh yes recolours of old skins instead of new skins cool also fight or fright game mode was dog shit only fun for a day or 2
Recycling old skins. Why is anyone still paying money for these
When will the game release on steam?
Everyone gangsta until they realize that Revenant passive ability also affects wall running
Why is Revenant so fkn cool
All I'm saying is revenant better have a dope skin
Who wants to bet that wall running will be the next Octane buff?
Where is the Bangalore heirloom
I can already hear the wallets screaming.
Wall run becomes a thing now
Im just interested. In the revenent finisher
Can we get one decent Loba skin?
SKULLTOWN
So they just re-colored last years Halloween skins??!!!! Man if apex could get ppl to make good skins and content more
This game is already dead
for a wattson skin you should make a nessey skin it would make since
PATHFINDER SHADOW GRAPPLE AND WALLRUNNING. I play Titanfall so everybody will hate me for it.
Bruh imagine they bring the wallrun then put the peacekeeper and r99 back on the ground  New players be like:
Cant wait to wallride on the sweaty ttv wraiths with a spitfire
DIDE THIS IS BADASS
0:20 ngl that looks like a pilot 👀
Kinda lazy to have the same skins ...just diff colors
wall running are they gonna take out wall jumps ?
Guys..  wallrunning...  I'm freaking out this is awesome
Where is revenant skin
Me (A Titanfall 2 fan): Sees wall running in apex Also me: *Happiness noise*
Is Revenent getting that revive animation for keeps? I wish I liked to play him more. He's asthetically very cool
And they said they couldn't input wall running....WTF GUYS !? now make it part of default movement !
Same skins with different chroma, wall run... What is the next?
I can’t play right now. Can you please extend it.
Right as my tv broke!!!
Im excited
I cry, there was no cowboy mirage
aaand nothing cool for Bangalore yet again..Rip me..
yes yes yes yes YES
Hey dev apex can comeout to mobile?
I will be angry if we don't get a wall run and double jump character, and trust me pal, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry 😡
Every one who has not played titanfall: this seem pretty cool  Me: HOLY FUCK THATS TITANFALL MOVMENT
He 2 revenants sound a lil diferent
They give the same 5 characters new costumes every event and just leave Crypto and other legends out to dry every time
Any news on the mobile version
I cant play apex when i start a game that say me invalid token
Why is mirage always getting destroyed in these trailers
Oh its about to get sweaty with the wallrunning ability in this event now.
Can you please make the r301 skin free?
At least they could make Worlds edge at night not KC again
Not my first dance with death  I’m sorry friends but your going to become a skelloton now           😂
0:28 how is he shooting like that, the bullets go up at an angle lol.
I like how they used revenants midnight skin as the other demention revenants model.
I loved this mode SO MUCH! So glad it’s back. And the 2 revs, like DAMN THERE’S GONNA BE A TURF WAR!
reused content?
This was a failure....for one of us
Will the legends be able to walk run?
I going to abuse everyone with the walk run
3rd person mode
Yes yes yes yes yes i love you respawn i loveeee you
Did i see wall running
Same skins from last year just different colors smh
@Apex Legends make revenants ultimate turn him and his squadmates into these shadows w/ wallrunning and double jumps but melee only
W A L L R U N BOIS
There's something so satisfying about chaining the b-hop..
where’s my lifeline skin
Yall really care about wall running no wonder this game is going to crap. They are bringing back old skins instead of making new ones . The devo needs to go back into care packages. And cross play progress should definitely be a thing COD warzone does it and they make plenty money
Everyone finally acknowledging the skill gap that will result due to wall running but no one is talking about Rev v Rev
So there won't be the mirage skin this year..?
YOOOOOOOO i experienced passing out today
Titan Fall players: Your journey ends here, legend - The walls belong to me. Nowhere to run... Nowhere hide.
Радует, что апексом реально занимаются и добавляют чота новое и интересное
recycled skins... bruh
My Titanfall 2 Players know what time it is
WALL RUNNING   LETS GOOOOOO
Looks good. Shame I won’t be playing it seeing as you screwed me out of the 10 flashpoint wins badge. Thanks apex
I know your probably not gonna see this comment but can you pls help me I can’t get into my account
Nice! More 20$ *RECOLORS*! Gotta love EA!
ウォールランできるのか！ 戦略の幅が増えるね！
Stand bu for titanfall
SKIN FORRR PATHFINDEEEERRRRR
Shiiiiiiiii... this game is hella fun. And what sucks is that I’m prohibited to celebrate Halloween, so even if I can’t leave the house, I’ll celebrate Halloween my own way!! Apex and Animal Crossing!! ♥️
Looks like Penny-wise though 🔥💯
TITANFALL WALLRUNNING TITANFALL WALLRUNNING TITANFALL WALLRUNNING  TITANFALL WALLRUNNING TITANFALL WALLRUNNING
Is wattsons vampires skin going to come out? (Me a fellow wattson main)
Look at 0:20. There’s a legend leak!
is it just me or when i saw the shadows climb I was like oh damn.
Goddammit why did I spend all my crafting metals already
TO SAY I'M EXCITED IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT
Season 6 is all about revenant
I Damm.
“Darkness finally has it’s day...”  “Couldn’t have said it better myself..”
A Jack Cooper le gusta esto ¡Por MacAllan, por la Frontera!
Shadow game!!?? Well someone has watching a lot of yugioh
Wish I could play this event 😞😭
Pense que con este evento iban a mejorar al menos un poco mas las cosas, pero veo que solo es mas reciclaje. Ahora mismo juego a esto solo porque e invertido dinero en el juego, sino lo hubiese dejado a principio de temporada. Es una estafa. Es un descuido increíble los que hicieron con este juego, cuando tenia la comunidad menos toxica y mas competitiva, todo se vino abajo. Esto es una falta de respeto, es una burla para los jugadores.
AND LETS GO WALL RUNNING JUST LIKE TITANFALL
Excited for the Darth Maul Gibby skin 👌👌👌
How much y’all think this event cost?
A mode gonna play for 2 hours then forget about it
NO WAY THIS COMES OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY
Two whole events and no rampart skin? Weirdchamp
Now this is legendary it is amazing and this is going to be awesome 🤩🤩🤯🤯🤯
So what should we call the revenant from the alternate-dimension, I’m thinking:       -Shadow revenant( from the alternate dimension known as AfterDark) -Ultimate revenant  - Omega revenant  -Alpha revenant  -The Devil knight  -Dark Rev  -Shadow Walker -God Rev  - The grim reaper -That1GrimReaperGuy
Ah did anyone think how would we separate between the actual shadows and rev shadows lol
only recolored skins? Nothing new? wow... that's the worst you can bring for a seasonal event, especially when it's halloween or christmas
At 1:03 if you look at the banner I think the new legend is seen just for a second on the banner
nice 0 new skin
Wall runs seems nice but i was expecting more than recolor of old skins and copy paste from last years halloween....ive got big expectations for the new map olympus next season !
1:11 No one is going to talk about revenant's new finisher ??
Everyone: oh cool wall running  Me, a titanfall vet who’s been playing since launch:
Arreglen su servidores para jugar a gusto el evento ): 💔
man again but so more difficult,how can i win????
These devs are lazy as shit. Recycling ltms and doing garbage recolors. Too bad ima play anyway lol
You need to run this event more it what got me playing apex and it what kept me around pls
Cool and spooky game , you should make a apex legends movie,  on Netflix it could  even be a series with scary story's told near October and more Christmas story of the legends at x mas , I can not wait untel they make apex legends into a movie! !!!!💀👻🎃🎃🎃
No fate didn't bring me back,     It was a notification.
Me who sees we can wallrun as shadows: YESS Me who also realizes that i can know kinda what it’s like to play titanfall: *YESSSSSS*
Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
Why  dont they make a bad ass skin for Bangalore  they alway dont make a skin for Bangalore
Respawn: adds wallrun Me: *Happy pilot noises
Titanfall players gonna be untouchable with the movement
1:10 new revenant finisher confirmed?
1:12  Vance: Passeri
👍💯
There is a frosty Loba skin and I want it. 👻
Ah shit, here we go again.
Everybody gangsta till they start wall running
I can’t buy any skin because I don’t have any money 🥺
Darkness finally has its day *Couldnt have said it better myself*    Trust no one,not even yourself
0:38 loba animation buff?
An event about revenant and he doesn't even get a legendary skin atleats its not shown in the trailer wow just wow apex
That revenant on revenant action tho
日本人どこ
WAS THAT WALL RUNNING I JUST SAW?!?!!?!??!!!
could have actually tried making new skins rather than recolouring old ones
Holy shit.. their "art" team is trash... No rev skin? Hire me I woulda put a reaper style skin for him, hood, skull and everything..
TITANFALL WALL RUNNING
My wallet has been abused day after day and I want to stop but these re skins are too good
Wtf wallrunning
Is Peacekeeper finally coming back?
Omg I'm so fucking happy this came back It's legit the best game mode in the history of apex
Recolors and back rarest skins, trash game and trash respawn
Really has been a year. This was my favorite gamemode ever.
Other than wall running it looks the exact same as last year.
GIVE US BETTER LOOT IN CHESTS NEVER GAT ANY FUN GAMES WITH SCRAP REPETITIVE WEAPONS SO BORING
So the event is about revenant but there is no skin of him wtf
This looks sick, can't wait to be taking down people with wall runs! Apex did it again!
Mahahahhahahahahahahahahahhaha kill
I feel most alive while rapidly approaching the update!
think you can do it agin   me: nope not even close
We TITANFALL Now
When the TF2 vets. Show up  Apex players: F__k
now the severs are gonna be laggy lol
And is the shadow Revenant the Halloween skin for him
They should make this duos because let's be real. Most of us queued at the same time as friends to get in same lobby or teamed up with other players anyways
Add mouse and keyboard for xbox and ps4 because people wanna do stuff on pc but they can't because there on console.
y no legendary halloween skin for revenant :( my man could easily be the grim reaper
I'll become a famous youtuber like these people one day😭
Revenant is alive his shadow from no where about no
TF2 MEMENT
Bunker boys bunker party bunker boy bunker party bunker boys bunker party:)
Cant wait to not see shit for most of the game while people hide and wait....and call it a fun game mode 👍🙂
the game's event is kinda going downhill tbh
Балин , одни английские комменты , хз теперь о чем было видео
no loba skin again ✨
YES IS THERE GONNA BE A PATHFINDER SKIN PLEASE❤️❤️❤️❤️
That content tho
They should fix the servers instead of making new trailers sorry old trailers I like apex but come on EA STEP UR GAME UP
This is wii be fun game mod
All I hear is screaming
Make or knm for ps4
Pathfinder: I'm sorry friend you're going to become a skeleton now  Prowler:NO U
Thanks you apex legends for bringing back the old one from session 3
it'll be fun lot of people will be playing
Common guys, titanfoll 3? :)
Apex you should put split screen
The fact bang gets no skins. Feels bad
let goooooooooooooooo
Invest in servers and audio please, it sucks the fun out of the game. (I have an 80mb/80mb fiber internet connection and i'm playing on ethernet cable with a 60hz monitor so don't even start the "fIx YoUr iNteRneT shit")
On my birthday!!
Wraith mains when they see this event:  My wallets being aimed at
OH MY GOOD
I never got to finish the original fright or fight!!! Tess!
All we need is MRVN to see us off the dropship
Wall running!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TF3 plz
If wall running becomes an ability for a legend, it'll probably be 5% of what you actually experience in this LTM. Like revenants ultimate lol.
Ok this looks sick!
The wallrunning is probably a teaser for horizons passive ability
Respawn needs to sort out caustics traps half of the time enemies never get injured from them
I wish there was another cooler lifeline skin
Fight or fright = the haunting of verdansk      I mean it’s a fact
Get ready to get Legends in the Pipe, Five-By-Five   >:)
А почему ценник  на годовалые скины такой конский?
Every body gangster till the shadows star wall runnen
As a rev main i approve
SPOOKY TIME!
Titanfall 2 movement coming back? Im going to kill everyone
Do u remember at the aftermarket trailer when revenant says " I am beautiful "
WALL RUN :o
Are they going to add some patch notes or they will hold them till season 7?
EA selling the same things, renamed. Truly familiar
Titan fall mechanics

I just realized that i have PTSD from the demeter fight from Titanfall 1.
I DIDN'T SEE A REVENANT SKIN
Wait we can create our own armies of zombies
Lmao yall so lazy over at respawn. Just recolored the previous  skins 😂💀 thats i i left this shitty game that they keep ignoring major problems. Last update was unplayable 😂😂💀💀 hope it get burried in the ground
Nobody can defeat me HAHAHAHA
Finally some good fucking food
WALL RUN WALL RUN TITANFALL 3 AAAAAAAAAAAAA
なにもワクワク感がない
Altather give me that new LTM asap
Wait I just realized something apex actually predicted 2020 because if the P2020 is bad so will 2020
I want the skin of octane and blody are so cool
Give bang love !!!! 7 season in soon and You havent Done shitt to her.
New FINISHER!??!!??!
Imagine your running to the ship and a horde of wall running Shadows are behind you
The badges were true
AUDHLADNBSJDKD WALL RUNNIIIIIING
Look at all the skin suits
Wow how lazy
Team deathmatch👀👀👀
again
At Last!  Let the games begin! 😈
Sorry I mean event
Im still waiting for my first win as Legend since last year.
Yeees
titanfall ever be most to this shit
I can't wait for this season
Y'all could've did better skins than just recolors. Don't give me that because it's the Rona fault. Look at Overwatch Halloween skins. I'm not wasting a single dime on these lazy skins.
Excuse me, did I just see skulltown and no one mentions that?
Pog
Titanfall players will straight up massacre the lobby when they become shadows
I guarantee you this shadow Titanfall movement is a test they’re doing to see how well it would work in the game. If it works, they’ll put it in.
Remember how people were complaining that Respawn takes too long to release new events...and so they hit us with two events back to back 😍
Mozambique here
So u can do a finisher while someone is doing it on another person...DOPE
OK apex legends I see you you gonna go hard
Oh no Did I just see legends running walls This isn’t Titanfall  The skill gap will only increase from this point.
Rip no Loba skin
This is incredible! I just wish that Revenant would have gotten an awesome skin, since it's kinda his event.
where is olympus
It’s just a remake of all the other skins this in my opinion it’s GARBAGE
Also it drops on 22 of october.
Every gangsta utill you see someone calling a legion
Так ну шо рашан народ мы дождались бег по стенам
Nashee
WALL RUNNING LET'S GOOOOOOO
Wallrunning is bullshit....everyone with scufs etc. Will have another advantage......
Its a spooky month
it would be fun if i could actually play a single match on ps4, it's impossible to find people to play with.
The reviant skin looks like a rare
i smell dootdoot
COPY PASTA, but SPOOOKY
Fellas there's double jump with that wall run ;)
*Respawn:* So here's this really cool Halloween event where your dead squadmates revive as shadows until everyone's de- *Players: W A L L R U N*
THAT BLOODHOUND SKIN IS NICE
Nooo muy bueno epic farte
I have the crypto skin on ps4 and might get it on pc
Wait no new heirloom?
Just like in the simulations pilots.
Lazy devs. Couldn't make the second Shadow fall for World edge. Same mode with extra skins.
Hope let you buy old skin then new one
Is it just me or is the TF references getting heavier and heavier....TF3 coming soon(?)
All running problaby its a teaser for the next legend
*Heavy Stim pilot main sounds*
Titanfall now? Sweet
Dibs on Titanfall 2 pilot! No one can have her! MY WALL RUN!!!!! 😠
Next event: We can summon Titans
The original FoF mode was one of my favorite LTMs. This one looks pretty solid, too. Cannot wait.
Yo is love getting a buff, watch her teleport in the vid
That ending though
YASDSS
Recolors? No thank you
Why they killed Mirage in trailer again.............???????????
I am happy, but are we really going to pay for the same skind with a different color?
やっば！！！！ めちゃくちゃ面白そう🥰
Was that WALLRUN?!?!?
I never clicked so fast in my life
Titan fall???
壁走れるのはヤバイ
I hope they don’t release the last year skins again. I hope the only ones available are recolors. I hate when I buy something limited and they rerelease it.
Pilots zobies
Can you confirm apex in season 7?
Ok yeah that's cool and all but WALL RUNNINGGGG LET'S GOOO FINALLY ABOUT TIME
Damn that wall run
New rev finisher
YO WALL RUNNING? IM DEFINITELY GONNA BE KILLING MY SELF SO I CAN BE THE SHADOWS
WALL RUNNING!!!!
When is switch out
1:16 sweet tooth twisted metal
When mirage isn't talking its boring, but still cool trailer
Fucking Spider came back i will never open chest this event XD
Woooweeee
This looks like it will be fun
Titanfall 3 CONFIRMED!!! 🦾🦾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Omaiga
Wow so all my last years Halloween costumes are getting reskined because your too lazy to make new skins pathetic
Kinda gay that the skins are just like alternate versions of last years skins. Millions of dollars spent on packs and they cant even make some new Halloween skins. This is why a part of the player base feels cheated and doesn't play this shit.
*I HAVE AWAKEN A SHADOW REVIVE*
Why does loba tactical animation feel faster?
Bro how many times do they have to beat mirage in these trailers.😂😂
YESS NOW ALL WE NEED IS WALL RUNNING AND DOUBLE JUMPING TO BE PERMENANT, I MISSED THISSS
Wallrunning and pilot movement should be a mutator game mode.
I kinda expect more than this...?
Me: Im depreesed Apex: How about...no
1:03 wraith with normal eyes 👀
Boys we did it . We can stand by for titan fall.
w...w....wallrun?
I just saw.........WALLRUNNING?! *Screams loudly by happiness*
Bruh i fr just saw BT'S face in the new challenges
1:13 why is gibby in the background on shadow revs shoulder? Is that gibby?
Bangalore doesn’t get a recolor, come on, that was her best skin
0:48  “always nice to see some familiar faces” **everyone changes their skin**
Did loba get buffedm she used her tactical and it went a lot faster then normaly
Cant wait to got that event
Lo único interesante, es que se puede caminar de costado en las paredes, nada más... No maten más a este juego que tiene futuro..
Halloween events > everything else
I thought rev got a new finshir
No one does wall running better than respawn. I’m excited.
Ah i see wallrunning is here *sighs* ah shit
October comes :  revinent : it’s my time now bitch
Plot Twist- The Revenant from Fight or Flight universe kills the real one or switches places and we never knew.
Better have shit for mirage
Gonna be streaming and playing this for sure!!
So this is the universe where the alternate revenant own yes ?
Loba tatical has been buffed- I’m happy now
I play a lot of titanfall2 and now I cant wait to be a shodow
Why you always beating up my boy Mirage 😢
A new Rev finisher, nice, but I already have the stabby through the chesty one.
SPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO    get u thought I was gonna say spooky huh
now we just need ronin
Best game mode is FINALLY back.
The skies belong to me pilot,no where to hide no where to run.
Reeeeeee
I dont understand is there new skins or the old ones again xD
I see Respawn is hard at work with the new skins. Lame ass tards.
WWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh shit!!! This comes out on my birthday! Thx Respawn!
BRO AFTERMARKET JUST ENDED U GUYS NEED A BREAK 😭😭(Fr tho really happy to see devs work this hard on a game, but damn u guys need to relax every now and again)
I smell a revenant heirloom don’t u think so?
Revenants still beautiful even tho he eliminated himself R.I.P. in chat. P.S. he was to beautiful that he had to eliminate himself😂😂😂
Getting some stim pilot flashbacks ❤️
exCuSe Me!1!1??2? Is ThaT A WalLRunnIng MiRaGe!!?
Yeah you know your revenant skins are bad that’s why you guys use such a common one.
WALL RUNNING!!!!!
Annnndddd no new Halloween skins. Nah why would there be any lol I was silly to think they might add just 1 at least.
Ok this is cool but it has been a year it feels like yesterday I was playing fight or fright
Where my Titanfall players at?
Developers please integrate wall running permanently
Running on walls like Titanfall... Let me put on my pilot suit.
LOVED the last Halloween mode.   These recolors are soo weak tho. SUPER weak.
Fucking wall running, finally respawn FINALY
cant wait :)
Just give us Indian server 😈
Couldn't have said it better myself
LETS GOOOOOO
Wait so no new Halloween skins just recolors?
Omggg i love this game
Where is Switch? <3
more bio-mec skin
Everyone: omg wallrunning!!!  Me who was too busy staring at the outfits: there was wallrunning?
Wait? That Loba bracelet preview, did that shorten the time on her ability??? 😍😍😍
This is cool and all, but why is it coming out Thursday instead of Tuesday?🤔🧐
The last event ended like an hour ago and we already get a new event who cares about school. did you see the bloodhound skin?
Finally wall running btw
Launches on my bday yaaaay!
So how does the totem work on shadows?
I   S M E L L  the old days
I’m going to yeet
Aaaaye, when your done regurgitating the same shit over and over again, let me know.   Or just work on Titanfall 3 for fuck sake like everyone else wants instead of this redundant, hot garbage.
They dead ass doing loba bogus 😴😴😴 can YALL GIVE HER A NEW OUTFIT!!!!!
Grunts!?!
I missed this last year so I’m lucky
Apex legends YALL gotta add a mode that is like every thing is like season 1 of apex legends like all the guns and stuff like that
Nice just a rehash of old skins that they will charge full price for smh
No hay skins pa la loba? :v
My wallet is declaring its safety corner.
Gonna get Mirage Cowboy Skin
Pick Watson and win on thw roof👌
Bruh this game dead. Who even plays this game
I wantttt this skin so bad but as always my wallet fazes away 😢
all the skins are recolors
Hopefully I have money to give u guys😂. But I’ll do it when next heirloom comes out. That will be my first😂
YEEEEESSSSS, FINNNNNALLLLLYY LEETTTTSSS GOOOOKKO
Me... A battlefield player : It's okay... I don't need this kind of event contents... T_T
When you get your neck snapped by...you
my brain is gonna explode, it looks like shadows are playing titanfall while we are playing apex
I don't have MONEY im sad
Ummmm where's Bangalore??
Same godly event from last year Wall running Full squads + revives until team wipe Back to back LTM’s Respawn is slowly making this year better for everyone
Can't wait for the upcoming bug💕
0:15 I didn’t know wraith wore adidas
No new skins, you're fucking kidding me...
i feel like im going to get jumscared alot
Me: I have played apex for too long it's time to try something else perhaps warzo...  Fight or fright event: allow me to introduce myself
Omg can't wait this looks really great
It would be cool if they added the wallrunning as a passive to revenant's and wraith's class, instead of amping the damage, it's useless anyways.
Dose this mean the gun skins too?
I predict the community likes the wallrunning so much it becomes a permanent mechanic lol.
Hey i cant play because i lost my account ;-; pls help
TITANFALL MOVEMENT!!??? AND WALLRUNNING!?? SIGN ME UP!??
Ight, imma go kill my self to WallRun again.
This is coming out on my b day yay
That zombie in that loot bin looks like a fucking Viper?!!!
Todos contentos hasta que cae un legión del cielo
Kinda sucks for the caustic recolor they got rid of the little clown gas canister he has on his chest that's my fav part about the skin
Suddenly everybody is an TF2 veteran🤷🏼‍♂️
Recycling skins come on apex lacks so much skins
Quedo mamalon
Omfg. * mind blows *
faq u where is my new skins ?
おいおいおい、待ちに待ったクリプトが出ないってか？
Should be renamed as Rev(n)event
Why make the same damn skins smh nothing will ever be rare
OMG 😱 recolores y evento reciclado. Apex siempre innovando
If you enjoy wallrunning, get titanfall 2 for more! Only available in your local Microsoft store, origin, steam, or PS4 store for only 19.99-29.99$
I finally realized that the shadows where wall running at the end of the trailer
AYO WTF
WALLRUNNIN IS BACK
The wall run might be a hinto horizons abilities or either a new legend .....
I love how they combine apex banner poses and finishers along with gameplay and actually have it make sense.
no revenant heirloom        unless?
WALLRUN！！
Wow Time to spend my life savings
Wall running + bunker = trick shot city
Hype
Thank god he told you guys to make a good job at the games
This event is going to come on my birthday I can't wait
Please , just this once ... make the grapple pilot be a thing and I will be happy at last
Apex Is SPOOKY again
Feel like titan fall, gotta love that wall run
0:50 footage of homophobic man brutaly beating  gay man
Hell yes hypeeeee!
WALL RUNNING
Omg that was amazing bro ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
New call of duty BO 3 Lmao 😂😂😂
Pretty sure it’s also double jumps for shadow form aswell as wall runs
Can we just take a minute to say that it is pretty cool that the legends are voicing over the event trailers
This even was so fun last year glad to see that it is back
I could be wrong but was that a buff to Lobas bracelet when she teleported?! It could just be a stylistic choice for the trailer but her animation after teleporting was alot faster.
error
おいおい　最高かよ
1:10 is that a new revenant finisher
1:11 Add.This.Finisher.For.Revenant.
Titanfall 2 Vets see wall running:   My time has come
Honestly no one wants these shit gamemodes and all that... all i want is solos and third person, best modes ever
SKULL TOWN BOIIIISSSSSS 💀
We experience thus epic game mode
Can't believe they ripped off the wall-running from COD: Infinite Warfare.
WALL RUN IS HEREEEE LETS GO
Black ops 3 vibes:
Me* Watches Trailer looking like 👀 Also Me* “Starts up Apex Ranked ... Gets Queued Solo Also Also Me* Flips Table In A Horrible Rage
OMG CAN'T WAIT 😍
Hopefully Revanent will be wall slideing from now on. he's still very underwhelming 10x better than the last two legands but that aint saying much..  make him what what the artists in-vision him to be!!!
HOLY WALLRUNNING
The wall run is fantastic
legends vs pilots
Wall Running... OMFG...!!! THE 64 IS A FAMILY AND IT'S BACK...!!!
Wow stark die lappen von apex sind halt mal wieder 2 Tage später als alle anderen (call of duty usw) dran. Und was anderes außer die gleichen skins wie von vor nem jahr zu bringen könnt ihr auch nicht weil ihr zu dumm und zu faul seid. Schämt euch
2 events in one month
dude i literally saw someone on apex who already had a shadow royale badge... like how is that possible
just recolors?
Wall run oh shit 💯
Wall running if you have played titanfall before or are a veteran then this should make you feel even more at home
yessss 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
To busy playing Cold War Beta
Wall running, it's about dam time.  Now give us Titanfall 3 respawn.
パイロットが帰って来た。
The thing we've been waiting for all year is finally here. HAPPY HALLOWEEN EVERYONE!!
スキンって課金せんといかんとかなー
"Invalide Token"
Fucking apex legends
We better get the path voiceline
No octane skin again 🙄🙄🙄
The social advocates like this comment if you understand I am a titanfall veteran I've played one and loved it and played/still playing titanfall 2 it's not bad but I feel like you die a lit faster than in titanfall 1 good thing they took out the smart pistol from loadouts
I uninstalled yesterday 😂😭😭😭😭
I barely did it last time...
Make a Titanfall 2 crossover on apex pls .we want more titanfall 2 action !!🔥🔥
Respawn. This is cool and all but the main thing that we need right now at this exact moment is better skill based matchmaking! Multiple of my friends quit Apex because of this reason...and I’m thinking about quitting as well. But if you put better skill based matchmaking, I’ll definitely play your game. Plz like this comment so Respawn can see this.
The new Legend passive needs to be wall runing
How come Rev didn’t get a skin!? He’s the spookiest character of them all
Where are the fkn bangalore skins ??
Titanfall fans: *sees this trailer and the Wall Running mechanics also Titanfall fans: "So anyways I started killing myself."
Titanfall 2 Veterans = happy nosies
うおおおお!!!!!!!!壁移動だ!!!! 待ってました!!これで俺も クーパーパイロットみたいに かっこよく出来るかな、超楽しみ✨
Don't worry, I'll be there once again.
Man iv seen tik tok videos with better transitions than this shit . Needless to say my bank is going to assume iv been hacked this coming week smh
Wraith: You chose the wrong door to knock on. Me: I chose the wrong event to spend my money on.
Mhm
No one gonna talk about thunderdome being brought back?
Great murder robots at it again
Revenant: boo Me:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Omg omg wall running double jumps omg omg
Why does it start Thursday?
WHAAATTTTTTTTTT WALLRUN?????? OMGGGGGGG
Damn Titanfall vibes
0:37 they listened to shroud!!!
Are you gonna fuck me up later respawn like today?. 5 hour with only 7 game played. With matchmaking taking 30 minutes plus just to be matched with complete idiot random?
I wanna Titanfall 3😭😭😭
Playing apex since release still don't know shit xD
Im convinced someone at respawn has it out for bang. I never really see her in any of these trailers :’(
Apex on a roll
Will we get the recolors free, because I have pumpkin patch and green widow ?
Titanfall 2  Apex edition
Nice trailer
It’s about time we get an announcement
The new mode looks fun but the recolors man you telling me you couldn’t make different skins this time?? Wtf apex
レヴのスキンはないのかな
WoW
Me: sees them wall running  Also me : *TITAN FALL FLASHBACKS*
So... No heirloom?.?.?
Why did revenant kill himself
Wallrunning in shadow fall that’s exiting
Jack cooper next legend
I hope you can give us 2 Apex packs for this mode we can get a chance to get a skin please apex legends do it please you guys think we are going to pay all of the apex packs like have  money give us two free apex event packs for this apex Halloween event please
They stole wall running from call of duty, anyone else notice? A shame they have to crutch off of a superior franchise...
YES TITANFALL 3. Wait, wallrunning, same thing.
AHH! Here we go again! the BEST BEST AND BEST (is there anything above best?) event ever! I am gonna kill my sleep and cancel all my works from 22 oct to the day the mode ends! Please give us Shadow fall instead of amred and dangerous whenever people starts complaining about servers and all other things, because it will shut down their mouth and remind everyone about the master piece. I will feel like every moment i stay out of this mode is useless. Gonna make my every moment worth by playing this all day and night. Thank you Respawn I love you <3
Imagine getting chased in skulltown with some pilot like fella's without a weapon
cool...but WHEN IS THE RELEASE OF TITANFALL 3 THE GAME THAT WILL DESTROY ANY OTHER GAME OUT THERE???
I really hope wattson got a proper vampire skin this time!
えあっ！？
Recycled event and recycled skins
Hey i love apex
This looks like Revenant's birthday party event trairer.
Titanfall squad we ready ?
Will there be free stuff to earn from challenges?
Bruh same skins bruh bro
oh boy i cant wait to hitscan on the walls
Is this already out
WoW 0_0
This is so fucking badass I've been waiting over here for this!
this game is over 1.5 years old and im still loving it. Now with that said, pls do something with the wattson double nerf.
I think they may have wall running from this LTM and the constant healing from Flashpoint in the new Arena mode that is rumoured.
Revenant: *likes the shadows* Shadows: *break his neck*
Looks like ea wants people's money again
さすがレヴ様✨ かっこいい😭

Fix " Invalid Token error " Please 🙄🙄🙄
Damn this looks good
Nice, wish there was a revenant skin tho
Me : New event is coming !!! My Wallet : i don't feel so good.
I always regretted not buying bloodhounds Halloween skin last year so I’m excited for this.

We should all come together and report a bot called Seko Seko
Let’s go

Again a recycled mode with recycled skins. Honnestly I'm a 200% Apex fan, but on this one, f. U Respawn.
Wow so basically nothing but reskins recycle/respawn never fails still hopeful but looks like literally the same shit from last year
Titanfall veterans: "this is where the fun begins"

Apex players:cool wall running! Titanfall veterans: * falling from the sky * "shut you up reaaal good"
I swear I saw wall running am I tripping 😅
We finally get tf2 vibes
With the new rules it seems like it's gonna be just another last team standing scenario. That's unfortunate. I feel like the older version of the event was more fun.
ㅤ
lame just recolord skins that deserves a big ass bruh
OOOO THE SHADOWS MOVE LIKE PILOTS
arreglen los servidores de ps4 que no puedo jugar
Are we able to buy these skins with crafting metals?

Dude that bloodhound variant is sick
Aw shit her we go again
Now I will get the ghostly graveyard skin
Revanent saying boo was the scariest part of this trailer.
When you realize octane will be the closest thing to a pilot now
Looks like such money grab event with 0 actual effort put in except for the little changes in skins and game modes....

I soooo gonna shit myself if I'm the not the shadow
Shadows: Can double jump, wall run and move faster Titanfall players: I'm sorry friends, but your going to become a skeleton now!
If you revive a teammate as a shadow that is the revive0:33
Titanfall players: this is where the fun begins
Do you think wall running is gonna be horizon's passive?
Was waiting for this to return for a whole year!
No recolor for octane?
Skulltown
Caustic: Theres no way theyll keep me as a clown this year...
Did Revenant just kill him self !? Sheesh

I hope there’s a new revenant legendary. How are they not gonna make one on his event...
Damn it respawn I do not always have money
Bro if we have wall running in the city
Pay Piggies Unite
Does the movement mean something for the future, because these events are like tests, last halloween was the test for revenents ability. Before octane was added, bounce pads were scattered around the map, so does this mean new legend, or dare I say Titanfall 3
spooky time
Leeesssssgoooo🔥🔥🔥🔥
I just want the glow in the dark 301 skin back.. I could care less about anything else in this realm of existence
Thank you Respawn for scheduling this event on Thursday. At least they get that some of us here be having school work and classes.
Time to have some fun >:D
This stinks. We want new skins. I don't understand, why the recolors?  The Overwatch Halloween event is amazing.
Its spoopy time
The wallrun OMG
Ой страшно очень страшно
Yes, now I can finally experience it for myself
When is apex legends coming to nintendo switch??
Event: me, nice  You can wall run: REAL SHIT
Revenant 🤝 a guy in a hat from alabama:  have absolutely nothing in common
Yesssss i love this event
Wall running with two hit kills tells me that I need to play titanfall2 again and do a no death run in the campaign give me a minute
Why is nobody talking about how loba braclet animation became faster
Revanent: the most haunted, spooky, evil legend in the game; DIDNT get a halloween themed skin??????? That shit look basic asf!
Pls apex bring wallrunning permanent in the game . This mechanic is very awesome
As a titanfall veteran I'll see where wallrunning can get us to
*sees wraith dying brutally in the first couple of seconds*   Are they reminding us of wraith's naruto run nerf?
titanfall 3 ?????
wall run is magic
The host is back revenant
I’m excited for this but the only thing I could ask is if they could lower the prices of cosmetics
Add a onsie ghost skin for wattson
ta nazhe
Yeah, did you mean to make the Shadow Royale badges viewable in the badge menu? You could see them as soon as the Aftermarket started.
This is what we like Apex!
Respawn keeps making trailers that blow my mind
El comentario en español
What is with the old Skins? Can we take it?
More of the same... GREAT!
SPOOKY MONTH!
lol thanks for the content apex
I CAN BE A REDDIT LUCIO ON APEX AHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA
no way this movement is a teaser for the new legend right?
HELL YEAH!!! HERE WE GO AGAIN!!! 🔥👊🏻❤️🔥
Why does wraith has a skin every event. Thats sad
Spooky event is here!
Respawn this season disappointed me and i was a huge fan make the next season like no other an make it better
Welp I’m missing this event :(
Any pathy skin probably not
I need skin Path , 2 event not skin legendary Path
*TITANFALL MOVEMENT TITANFALL MOVEMENT TITANFALL MOVEMENT*
Wait, I thought Crypto's vampire skin was getting a recolor.. Is he not, or is he just not shown here?
❤️❤️❤️❤️
PILOT WALLRUN OF TITANFALL OH YEAH 😄
AHHHH😱 1:03
The first time this came out, my playstation had a virus. I happy they're bringing it back
Copy paste from last year👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Nice
Sooo they couldn’t come up with different skins this year? They just re colored the originals...... respawn has difficulty designing cosmetics
So hyped for this, last years fight or fright was sooo much fun
wall run is back, finally. Just completed the master difficulty on titanfall2 so should be prepared
That’s right it’s the Halloween event. So let’s start by giving revenant a pirate outfit instead of a skeleton, mummy or grim reaper outfit
Can we still get the fake 20 bomb with this 😂
Bet respawn just put the grunts as zombies in loot crates and gave the shadows titanfall wallrun 0:20 just look closely at the zombie
TITANFALL VETERANS, ASSEMBLE.
*_In my Games, you will fear the Darkness in the corner of your eye.. get Ready for Shadow Royale, There is no going back from now on.. Hunt. Or get.. hunted._*
I know how wall running is pretty much confirming a return of titanfall but I'm more worried with the horde of shadows that will rush my squad with wall running
Boo
R A T T L E D
Nintendo switch
Bring back lifeline zombie skin!!!!!
OMGGGGGGGG
love to see it
Man so many events!
now the question is are we getting a heirloom, and who will be getting it?
It would be nice to earn some of these cosmetics seeing that we recently dropped bags on the current event’s cosmetics.
Yo apex how long til it comes on swich
Отлично! Будем играть на стримах. Будет очень гореть пердачело)!
HYPE TRAIN HALLOWEEN
I like  how apex is just getting better over time
Are we going to be able to buy the new recolors with crafting metals?
Wallrunning!
Wait a minute is that a new Revenant finisher?
and not a glimpse of Wattson. sadge.
Titanfall players it's our time to teach them a lesson.
皆さん、ご無沙汰しております。悶絶少年専属調教師のタクヤと申します」 「今回の、悶絶少年大全集第一巻はいかがでしたでしょうか？」 「悶絶少年初期作品は、比較的オーソドックスなSMプレイがたくさん盛り込まれていたかと思います」 「これからお見せする撮り下ろし映像も、基本的なSMプレイをお見せしたいと思います」 「今回調教する少年はまもるっ。ハンサムなマスクと、均整のとれた体(嫉妬）」 「まだ19歳のこの少年は、私の調教に耐える事が出来るでしょうか？」 「それでは、ご覧下さい」
Hoooooooo my God! Skin wowowowo
Can we justo appreciate the living dead in 0:20
Que palha tudo reciclado , ridículo !
Good bye wallet
Me wanting the lifeline skin that they didn’t bring back 😭
Indian servers pls.............
Can we all talk about that old  kings canyon is back?!
I see what they did. They made shadow revenant you know the king one from shadow fall and made him kill our revenant the normal world one
That lifeline res tho
Wall running pog
Happy Halloween
Wall Run and the event drops on my b-day! It's like HEAVEN!
Wall running is back!
They could have at least made legendary skins for octane, lifeline, revenant, loba, rampart, wattson, pathfinder.
Y e s
Bloodhound emote better be back;(
YAS GIVE ME THAT WALLRUN!!! <3
Do y'all think this is like another collection or just a rotating store? I'm so hype for spooky bh being back tho!
why the hell the sea servers have no players in limited time  modes?
Excuse me did you just *Wall Run*
Loba buff
Does this mean we will get wall runs in future update hmm?
Wait guys it is a repeat, not even new skins, just recolour ones.
IT'S BEEN 6 SEASONS TOO LONG WITHOUT WALL RUNNING! SO GLAD TO SEE IT NOW
it comes October 25 right?
God damnit.... we can fucking run on walls now...
UwU what's this, wall running
Good thing the cosmetics are shitty, I don't feel as motivated to buy one this time.
Bring back R-99 and PK
*WALL RUN*
I hope that they are making shadows wall run because they are testing if it works. i would love to wallrun in apex legends
Ah yes mirage gets his face crushed in. As usual.
So can we get easy 20 bombs in this mode?
#GOBRT
タイタンフォールやん
Ambush ambush there’s another event!!!
Any bunny hopper in titanfall 2, “you can’t run from US”
Is there a R-301 skin
Wait did nobody notice the zombie though who is it
NEW ANIMATION FOR KILL TO REVENANT
Better not be a repeat just like the grand soirée
You let everyone down by recoloring skins instead of making new ones
WALL RUNNING
So, titanfall 2 melee only?
Dooting intensifies
if shadows are the only thing able to wallrun in this mode, the mode is going to die very fast due to every single titalfall player immediately going off the side of the map from the dropship just so they can wallrun around the map, as much as i like the fact that wallrunning is a thing now cause i too love titanfall, if it's only shadows it was a very poor addition
YES YES YEEEEEEEES
Heyyy
Вот это круто
THE SHADOWS HAVE PILOT WALL RUN YES!
0:31 people who fail NNN be like
BACK TO BACK EVENTS THANK YOU SO MUCH APEX
0:20 who the heck is this guy?????????

Let's goooooooo
Yesssssss finally! Thank you Apex
I'm excited for this event😃😃😃

Я его так долго ждал ура
PLZZZ OH PLZZ may revenant have an halloween skin OH PLZZZ

WTF revenant kiling revenant 1:13
Oooooffff 🤭🔥🎉👀😱🏆🥳🥳
Same skins from last year? They just changed color schemes??
Me (a Titan Fall fan): *sees wall running*  *Heavy breathing*
Thx for adding wallruning back into the style of the titanfall universe honestly it brings back humble memories
oml u can run on walls :O thats crazy ima be playin this mode 24/7
WALL RUNNING!!! THE ZOMBIES WERE WAL RUNNING
Chills everytime revenant opens his mouth
Pls no prowlers i hate those things
Holy crap now I wanna be a shadow this time
Respawn: adds wall running for an event Me: happy titanfall 2 player noises
Im exited qwq
What makes me not want to play this mode is that it will go away in a week, and I will be hooked and won't be able to wait another year.
CANT WAIT TO DUNK ON YOU GRUNTS WITH THAT MOVEMENT
FINALLY ALL MY PRACTICE IN TITANFALL WILL HELP
this is what i like to see, season 6 was so dry and now you guys are putting out events after events. Good job boys
oie zi 7w7
You can wall run as a shadow. Me and the titan fall homies: *visible happiness
Call of duty better
キタァァァァァァァ‼︎o(｀ω´ )o
Lame
Wall running at 27.0 nice
Exodus, retrispects and orther wallet after event: *Dead wallet found*
More skins for the SAME CHARACTERS 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
Imagine walruning with death protection !!
If wall runs were added I would be above you all
Thank you revenant, very cool!
I can definitely see them have the pilot's passive be wall running because of how broken it is
*PILOT WALLRUNNING AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*
Revenant Mains Still Waiting On Revenant Heirloom 🙇🏾‍♂️
Yes I have not seen this in so long I have always wanted to play this again
this is going to be fun friends
Man. I forgot to get the final After market thing for Octane. Now my main is incomplete. Rip
YAAAAAS
Bangalore skin pleaseeee
Me before seeing this:Man I'm bout to take a break After seeing this: Back to the grind I go
Its hard to understand that Revanant have bones in his neck
Time to make a custom trailer out of this event
HOLY SHIT YOU CAN DO TITANFALL LEVEL WALLRIDING
What time will this mode released
We can finally walrun
"You can't keep the dead asleep... Better start running..." - 🌚      "The skies belong to me...." 🦇🌃
Sorry but did I just see TITANFALL MOVEMENT
Wraith as a witch? Nice.
My wallet is screaming no but my body my body is telling me yes
No new heirloom I wanted to buy lifelines thing
Did Revenant JUST snap his own neck?
Omg
Y E S
Weird to think that a year ago we didnt know who the fight or fright announcer was..
Peackeeper will be available on ground ???
My account is banned for 7 days thanks to EA and xbox players.
Is nobody gonna talk about how us OG Titanfall players will be moving as shadows rn
no hairloom😤
Wow grape
Trailer : was cool Advanced movement : halo theme song
Is this apex or mortal kombat? I see a whole lot of finisher next thing you'll know is the announcer is like finish him/her.
Bro if they add wall running to the game Wraith mains will be an even bigger pain to go against
Whoa, wall running? Finally, BT I’m doing it again.
did i just see that PK
0:26 respawn you ever gona fix the weird gun angles i know its not the biggest concern just a annoyance when you think your not being aimed at
You ever wanna comment something but see so many comments and say fuck it?
Thank God wall running is only back for shadowfall. Apex is way better as its own game rather than the BR version of titanfall.
課金しなきゃだめな奴かぁ、、 あースキン欲しいってーーーーー 金ねえってーーー
Oooo
yea but when will you fix the game
Only true legends played last year event
ADD WALL RUNNING TO OCTANE FOR US MAINS
OMG i love Apex is having  consecutives updates
Is that a new revenant’s finisher ?
Nothing pathfinder related AGAIN. Disappointing to say the least
Am I going to be going against triple stacks in this game mode or are we ACTUALLY gonna get to enjoy not sweating my hands into early arthritis
Disappointed by EA and respawn I haven't been able to play for 3 weeks because of an invalid token, I'm going to lose my Pass Apex coin and my progress I played the Cold War beta (it was also crossplay) and I had no problem, it is not possible that I can not fix the error after so much, I will finish uninstalling the game if there is no insurance of my apex coins
Siiiii!!! Yeeeeaaaaaa!🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤😊😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
これが噂のペニーワイズスキンか
This makes ne sad I taught it would be more hyped
There's a new transmission from horizon, she mentions "Branthium." I think that word was used after Ashes head was put together from season 05. Is that a planet or something?
Has no one noticed that Skull town is in this video?
Buff pathfinder
Can't comprehend how this is going to work, I'm guessing the people that have the skins will have to just buy the recolors and the rest have to buy both? Really want that Bloodhound recolor, but I don't have the original.
Oh yes skins that bring players happiness forever .... not really
Yes... Y E S
TITANFALL
THE gospel is 1st Corinthians 15 verse 1-4  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
Cool
My theory is that wall running is gonna be Ash’s passive ability and they are testing it out here👀👀
Is that a new REVENANT FINISHER?
I'm probably not going to play this because of the Haunting of Verdansk event in Call of Duty Modern Warfare
WITH EXCITING NEW BUGS!!
After 0:19 who the heck is that? Is that octane? I can’t tell which character that skin is for, it looks awesome though.
It is S P O O O O O K Y season
Yes
WALL RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????????????     tf3 vibes anyone?
but please can u add wallrun to regular games in apex
タイタンフォール3ってマジィ！？
Octane wall running is going to break the universe
Did i just see the shadows run on walls pog
looks boring tbh
the warzone's event is better than this
Not sure if being the last guy alive will be pressure af or ego boosting bc it's like ayeee look at my little shadow bois backing me up 👌 Randoms can't call u trash (even if u are) if you die last, because they died first 👀
Im hyped WALLRUNING On COMING POG
WALLLLL RUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
yeeeeeeesssss this is what I need
Overwatch had 4 years to do what apex has done in one
I only just started playing AL, about 20 hrs in. It desperately needs a mode to help noobs like me get better. I have no opportunity to learn the map or weapons as I'm getting roasted in all game modes and it's putting me against people with 60 season 6 wins, please listen
And we get to earn nothing and have to spend a small fortune to get any cosmetics.
Just 2 more days 😀
Oct. 22 is my birthday 🥳 thanks apex!
CAN I KNOW WHERE IS BANGALORE'S HEIRLOOM (Kukri Knife)
レイスの顔綺麗だな
Now I can totally see wall run being added to the game somewhere down the line 🔥
OMG mjghcfgc so cool
Бег по стенам! Наконец-то! Надеюсь бег по стенам будет в седьмом сезоне по умолчанию.
Me:sees wall walking Me: cooper corfirmed?
Decepcionado de EA y respawn Llevo 3 semanas sin poder jugar por un error ("token invalid") voy a perder mis Apex coin del pase y mi progreso Jugué la beta de cold war (también fue crossplay) y no tuve ningún problema, no es posible que no puedan arreglar el error después de tanto, voy a terminar de desinstalar el juego si no hay un reembolso de mis Apex coins
Anyone remember the first one I do
L'événement est tellement claqué que vous êtes obligé de ramener les move de TF2 sur apex pour faire remonter la Hype mais le jeu est déjà mort 🤣🤣🤣
that bloodhound skin is an instant cop......      .... 0:21 is my wallet rn
HOLY HELL WALLLRUNNNN
its sad that i cant play cause i have to bring  my grades up
Очередной тот же самый режим на той же карте ... круто круто
Okay good but why there is no rampart skin?
I didn’t play the nightmare event, i am SO HYPED NOW
Yo I'm early
Lets go 🔥🔥🔥
ALL PILOTS its time to shine
CAN'T WAIT!!!
When you think your skin is Special then you see this
This put a smile to my face
la catrina Bangalore skin?
I'm gonna miss this again...🥺🥺🥺    FUCK!!!!!
Is that the peacekeeper I see???
Who played titanfall 2 is on the hype
こんなん買うしかないやん、ずるいやん
Epic
YESSSS
Return to the Shadows💀
So the skins from last year are re colors that u can buy with legend coins or u have to buy them with yellow coins?
Revenant killed himself
Too bad these randoms got me so frustrated it led me to uninstall the game. When they have Solos I'll come back.   I'm having a better time playing Yakuza 0, so it's all good
I know Caustic deals in Gas..But i dont like his Halloween Clown skin, i would've preferred something to like Jykel and Hyde or Dr.Frankenstin. However i would consider his Aftermarket skin as his Halloween skin. On another note, everyone is probably gonna main Wattson again due to her ability to just sit in a building and camp all damn game. But overall im glad theyre bringing back the game mode.
كانها تايتن فول
I hope the variation skin are craftable or buyable with red coin. I already have the Bloodhound skin, I wish I can craft that with red coin.
Recolor do Mirage vai existir?
Why can't they ever make new skins bring back old ones with a different color and make us pay 20$ how lame
rev alt control so he can choose when he can leave shadow protection. like the way wraiths portal works.
Opa já gostei desse novo evento!!! GGG
I hope if you have one of the old skins you can get the recolor for Legend Tokens.
WALLRUNING IS BACK
Titanfall Wallrun is now appear on apex legends as shadow legends.
lucio in apex legends?
Loba equiped her bracelet faster
can we think of free rewards
T I T A N F A L L  2  M O V E M E N T 😆
BRO WHERE IS THE LOVE FOR BANGALORE
Watching this on 2160p60😳
Same Shit as last Year. Really ? Nope...
So for all the People including me, who already own everything from last Halloween, anything new
WALL RUN AND INFECTED!!!!!!!
Was that a new finisher for Rev at the end?
Can’t wait to have some new content! They also fixed pathfinders eye nice
wall run in the game????
Wait is this squads?! I'm super hyped!!
YOOOO WALLRUNNING! I HOPE I CAN SLIDE BHOP LIKE IN TF2
I'm gonna go broke after this *-*
Rev kills Rev
와씨발 드디어 벽타기가 나오다니 타이탄폴에 있는것들 이제 점점 다넘어오는구나
How are the new styles gonna work
Nope nope nope nope nope
Revenant 2 when?
First Shadow Royal: People quit cause they become shadows  Second Shadow Royal: Everyone comitts suicide to become shadows for Titan Fall movement.
Is really cool and fun
I LOVE YOU

00:26 WALLRUNNING HERE WE COME TITANFALL 3
Imc solder? 0:20
IS THAT A WALL RUN?!!!
I hope we get some cool free skins
Apex: releases this  My wallet: wallet will remember this
crossplay is good to find matches but they should pair platforms with the same platform because PlayStation players are very toxic.#SOLOMODE
crossplay is good to find matches but they should pair platforms with the same platform because PlayStation players are very toxic.#SOLOMODE
When’s the update?
I want the bloodhound skin soo bad
If you’re a shadow and get killed, are you done for the game or do you keep respawning as a shadow as long as a teammate is alive?
YES YEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ITS FUCKING BACK BABY LETS GOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
crossplay is good to find matches but they should pair platforms with the same platform because PlayStation players are very toxic.#SOLOMODE
As a wall running main on tf|2 this will be pleasant
Like the game, but the servers are tilting me so bad
Holy i cant wait
OMG
Still no pathfinder skeleton skin?! Give the people what they want respawn!
99% of comments about wallrunning Me: wait, where's Revenant's Halloween skin?
I overheard kids at school saying: “wall running”  I was like pshhh then saw this. Not disappointed
everyone else: oh yeah this is cool me: *wallrun* *wallrun* *wallrun* *wallrun* *wallrun*
This Christmas can we bring back Wraith from season 3 please
I've been waiting for this since the year started 🤠👌🏻🤩🤩🤩🤩
WALL RUNNING

It’s just like Halloween but titan fall

Please Rampart and Loba skin for halloween I need itttt
Titanfall players, let's talk about how are we going to abuse the wallrun
we are pilot
Respawn doesn't care about bangalore?
Great
I love this mode from last year but with changes it will be fun
I have Watson and just here to say take Watson to win.  :-):-)
My wallet after the AfterMarket event: EMPTY!  Respawn: New event, new skins!  My wallet: Don't even think about it...
Did the shadow just double jump at around 0:44??
0:21 from where this?
OMGGG the only thing i payed attention to was the loba buff, was that just editing or is that actually coming?!?!?!?
TITAN FALL3 IN SKULL TOWN
Can we just get server fix, playing this game is the real horror with these servers
REspawn added wallrunning?! MAybe Revenant can wall run longer than the others, since ya know, Revenant-
I cannot lie. i got a little gitty when i saw the wall running. all the TF|2 flashbacks hit me at once
que basura :v
Is it just me, or does Mirage have to get bodied for like almost EVERY trailer???
Revenant sure loves his job
Can i buy something from this event with my crafting materials? Or they all cost coins
i miss shadowfall
Is now one going to talk about the part at 0:20
Awesome ❤️
one of the reasons why i love apex legends
just recolor? Where is wattson?
Wall running
FINNALY WALLRUN, please put this on the rest of the game, i love apex but thats the one thing that make me choose titanfall over apex
Valorants the best game
Ojala poder jugar el modo porque me banearon por nada :(
1:05  isnt that a sound FX from Among Us?
Shadow Royale event music is on my channel! check it out!
Now you can wall run. Plus the shadow=teammate resurrection sequences looks very horrifying
Wallriding? My titanfall 2 self is waking back up. WAIT NO PLEASE DON-
Nunca nada para Bangalore !!!! Pongase las pilas desarrolladores !!!
Titanfall movement babyyyyyy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
El mejor battle Royale de todos en mi opinión, El evento está cool
TF3
Wait, is it just Shadow royale and not the OG Fright or Fight ltm?
Octane have to can wallrun...
GOD DAMN
Revenant: darkness finally has his day.  Shadow revenant: couldn’t of said it better my self. *kills normal rev*
Wall running in apex!!!!!!!!!!
FINNALY WALLRUN, please put this on the rest of the game, i love apex but thats the one thing that make me choose titanfall over apex
Let's be honest, that Wraith and Bloodhound alternative skin looked like some heat. Definitely copping
What I thoud first: Isnt this the same stuff like last year What I'm thinking now: This is awesome XD
Hoooooly sheeeeet
If you look loba had a shorter anamation after tactical
I’m not surprised they just copied last fight or fright #ripapex
Good work on the wraith skinn by changing colours
Who else played Shadowfall last year?
Lol Warzone won this Halloween event.
"Things made of death" with Titanfall 2 movement and a two-hit kill. And I thought 2020 was already scary.
Titanfall players: lets gooo  Apex players: wallrunning WTFFFF
I didn't get the OG wraith witch skin last year but I need that recolor it's awesome
crossplay is good to find matches but they should pair platforms with the same platform because PlayStation players are very toxic.#SOLOMODE
Lol anyone notice that titan fall 2 army soilder zombie form? Forgot the name
A legend with wallrunning would be OP, but I would like Revenant to have wall-walking. Give him the ability to climb surfaces, but also stay there like a spider. It would make for some very interesting plays if you can crawl on ceilings
crossplay is good to find matches but they should pair platforms with the same platform because PlayStation players are very toxic.#SOLOMODE
Why is this even publicly posted when only the people who have money to waste can enjoy this
crossplay is good to find matches but they should pair platforms with the same platform because PlayStation players are very toxic.#SOLOMODE
Revenant heirloom... confirmed???
crossplay is good to find matches but they should pair platforms with the same platform because PlayStation players are very toxic.#SOLOMODE
If they bring wall running into actual matches it’s gonna be fun
Nice
crossplay is good to find matches but they should pair platforms with the same platform because PlayStation players are very toxic.#SOLOMODE
crossplay is good to find matches but they should pair platforms with the same platform because PlayStation players are very toxic.#SOLOMODE
Let's be honest the recolor ugly sorry respawn
I swear if a new character doesn’t get to wall run and it’s only for the event I’m gonna cry myself to sleep the night the event ends
crossplay is good to find matches but they should pair platforms with the same platform because PlayStation players are very toxic.#SOLOMODE
October 22? Not October today? 🥺
Marco i am a suscritor
omg this looks amazing
so worlds edge in night?
crossplay is good to find matches but they should pair platforms with the same platform because PlayStation players are very toxic.#SOLOMODE
payday in my country is in november 5th, fuck you respawn
crossplay is good to find matches but they should pair platforms with the same platform because PlayStation players are very toxic.#SOLOMODE
I can’t wait for the third parties
Another clown skin WOW!!!!!
Why has loba been spared
No tengo dinero xd
Bo3 walk run
LET'S GOO
Make new finishers for ever legend!!!!!
crossplay is good to find matches but they should pair platforms with the same platform because PlayStation players are very toxic.#SOLOMODE
前回のクソみたいなのと同じじゃなければいいけど
Where my Titanfall veterans at?
I can't wait to seee omg!!!!!!!
Всем СНГ-шным друзьям привет!
WallRunning 👀
WTH we have @zylbrad and @macro
1:11 new finisher
The Halloween event for Warzone is way better.
Finally wall running!!! I hope your teasing this as an ability for a future champ. I wish they would just make a pilot from titanfall a character.
As an Titanfall Veteran I don't think it will be possible, but imagine the speed you could gain if it would be the same mechanic as in Titanfall 2. Speeding up to 100kph, although only those who mastered this technique in the past will be able to achieve this speed. Dunking on these "Legends". But I don't think the map is build for this. Even tho looking forward to this event🔥🔥
Yesssssssssss
Every Halloween in apex, spooky, caustic, clown, caustic clown, caustic clown.
the pk
Arreglen los servidores, no sean culos que van muy mal (el juego me gusta )
Oh me oh my am I going to die
wallrunning will finally make people stay in game when they become shadow
Yes
titanfall 2 fans: liked this
Is it just me or was when loba but back on her bracelet it was faster
Where my pilot squad !!! Wya 6-4
We get this event on my birthday!!!!!!
to devs "why you guys wattson that much ?"
BANGALORE SKIN
Can't wait to run around in the OG Fright or Fight event skins that we all bought from last year
Did I just saw WALLRUN?!!!!?!
wall running as a shadow lets gooooo
Wall running?!?!
so basically just recycled from last year??
BANGALORE SKIN
hype
くっそおもろそうやん しかもイベスキンも変えてくれてるし 古参の人も文句ないやろ
Apex seasons are too long now as I notice
*Wallruning shadows exists*  Titanfall Veteran: Its time to come from the dark
BANGALORE SKIN
I'm sorry apex but warzone took my heart
BANGALORE SKIN
my wallet hates your game
OMG THEY PUT EFFORT INTO MAKING AN EVENT
BANGALORE SKIN
BANGALORE SKIN
It's still sad that all the skins from the event are all reskins from the past and we doesn't have new ones ;-;
ウォールランはガチ神！ みんなもタイタンフォールしよう

C'est quand apex sur Switch
The editing of the transitions from the old skins to the recolours was soo good!
Every time i hear revenant's voice i get happy
Lol wow re-skins.  Game changing cosmetics there
Wall runs are being tested   Jack COoper, is that you????
Wall running hype!
Where is my babe wattson?
I SMELL S P O O K Y CONTENTS!
YES
The new war zone game mode was just a copy of last years Halloween event
BANGALORE SKIN
refreshes refreshes REFRESHES FUCKINGGGGG REFRESHESSSSSSSSS
WALL RUN YES
You need to run to evac ship??
Okay but are the new skins recolors? Like do we have to own the other skins first?
Aftermarket: Servers suck Devs: How about Fight or Fright?! Players: It is another rehashed event with wall running.. AND just recolored skins from last one...  Me: *Getting closer and closer to uninstalling*
So it’s basically reskins with practically the same mode which sucked in the first place. Lame.
Same event, same skins... hmmmm... don`t like this.
Oh man I hope theres a easter egg
imagie 2 youtubers commeting on a vido
Otra actualizacion de 10gb :/
Wall runnn! WALLL RUNNNN!
This is going to be fun
Nice, and Better.
There will be skin of Revenant?
IS BANGALORE'S SKIN ARTIST UNDERPAID? BANGALORE SKIN
Me: So, we are getting the same game mode and the same skins but recolered, really?  Respawn: we are adding wallrun to shadows  Also me: *titanfall veteran noises*
Is revenant getting a new finisher?
It is time
i have no money to buy a skin for it man that sucks
Titanfall 2 players, this is your time to clap some movement noobs
estara increible este evento :0  esta mejoradisimo
Octane should get a somewhat Flash skin
Neat it's the same time rainbow six siege comes to game pass
Lol.just recolour.😒
This looks glorious !!
Nothing makes me happier than seeing a wraith stabbed through the chest, wraith players are actual no life degenerates
Respawn: Nerfs Spitfire And Devotion  Also Respawn: Creates a game mode Spitfire and Devotion are good at
Crazy game 😁
BANGALORE SKIN
Wait that’s skull town
I think alot of people dont know that wall running is onlt for the shadows-
The skins are very boring
Why didn't they show the Bangalore heirloom?
😣💕💕💕 i love Apex
BANGALORE SKIN
When comes to nintendo switch?
Like I said, friend! You would turn into a skeleton! Plus, Revenant is having fun!
BANGALORE SKIN
Of all the events that have a legendary revenant skin, Halloween was the more likely to give the best one, big disappointment that there's none, come on, it's revenant's world how could they not give him a skin
Apex: let’s add Titanfall movement  Me: yes
Wall running
BANGALORE SKIN
TITANFALL WALLRUNNING TITANFALL WALLRUNNING TITANFALL WALLRUNNING TITANFALL WALLRUNNING TITANFALL WALLRUNNING TITANFALL WALLRUNNING
Rip wallets and credit cards
Goosebumps once again
闇のゲームの始まりだぜ！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！

What’s the skin at 0:19
BANGALORE SKIN
TITANFALL MOVEMENT LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO proper slidehopping when
So we aren’t running to an evac ship with 20 or so shadows trying to kill us... that doesn’t seem like the same game mode to me. In fact it sounds more like a cross with live die live
Wall running, lazy skins
Dose anybody who want's the diamonds trails back ? Plese Respawn this will be a beautifull reward at the end of the season :) (sorry for the approximative english)
Did I just see mirage wallruning???
content
Reskins. Really? At that price? Poor show.
YESS!!! Apex never lets me down
titanfall2 players right now 😊finally something familiar
YES YES YES YES YES
Did they get the idea to change the colors from Grandma's Boy. The elves on level 6 and the Gremlins on level 9 look kind of similar. Halloween your opportunity to make the dopest skins. Hopefully the pay Piggies don't unite for that
Pog

maad lad revenant
Just want to say when they were making apex it was gonna have wall Running in it but they scraped it because it just didn’t work for a BR like apex they said
Eee pinches vatos dejen ahorrar dinero, no se puede ahorrar ni tantito porque ya sacan otro pinche evento, lo compraré todo pero me ofende mucho.
TITANFALL MOVEMENT HERE WE COME
Happy hallowen 🎃🎃🎃
YOU CAN WALL WALK-- WHATEVER THAT THING IS, OMG!!!!! FINALLY!!!!!!!! (yes, i know, i play titanfall 2, ok?)
The best game mode of this game
TF|2 players: GET ON WERE GOING TO DESTROY SOME ZOMBIES
Did u see?Loba’s tactics ability was so fast.
If i already have the hallowen skins, i get the recolors for free??
pretty sure i already knew about the shadow royale event but cool skins
This looks soooo badass, but probably cosmetic will be too expensive
Lets go pirate queen
Wallrun. Wallrun. WALLRUUUUUN!
wack...no new skins for other legends
Nice
no herloom ; (
Titanfall 2 player: 0:00 - ok. new apex event.  0:20 - Wait what? A pilot? Good trolling respawn heh... 0:27 - OHHHHHHHHHH MY GOD. JESUS. I WANT TO PLAY THIS THING! 0:43 OK. TF3 CONFIRMED. YEAAAAAAAAAAH

When is it coming to switch🤔
Holy moly my wallrun tu respawn i love u
i legit yelled out "we're going full titanfall". y'all think rev ult will be reworked into this??
Cant wait for people to actually cry about wall running instead of just enjoying what looks like a New LTM FINALLY!
Who else waited for this event to come back
Y'know what I'm tired of saving crafting materials I'm getting the bh skin
Respawn: introduces wallrunning as a shadow  Titanfall vets: suicide is badass
Ayy I think Loba's bracelet got a buff. Looked like it traveled faster and she put it away faster after using it.
Fight or fright 2? Take my money
The shadows running on walls ? :o
Random Question but does anyone even remember Fnaf anymore??
the reskins better be for legend token,stop being so greedy...its just a reskin.
Hell yeah we pilots now boys
Pofin lo mas esperado llega
Me: See’s Loba teleport animation faster  Also Me : BOUT TIME!!
Revenant: Prepare for trouble Revenant's evil Twin: And make it double
those re-skins better be able to be obtained if you have the original
Loba teleport animation buff  0:38
Exited, still a bit dissapointed
Alright gen 100 gang. Its our time to shine
Fortnite: sees wall running Write that down!
HOLY SHIT IM EXCITED I DON'T EVEN HAVE WORDS, WHY AM I WRITING THIS COMM-
YESSSS
Same skins, new colors
We want WINTER EXPRESS back please!
I love this
Cool they don't bring in the OG Hellowen Skins
HELL YES THE RETURN OF THE COSMETICS AND THEY LOOK BAD ASS!!!!!!!
テスト期間中にイベントが来るとは…
I sniff some content guys
Who/what skin is that at 0:20? Octane or Revenant? It's the only skin in the trailer I don't recognize.
YOOOOO
Can you buy these skins with crafting materials ?
Imagine they put a duck
Finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wallrun
ついに、前シーズンストーリーミッションで夢見た【亡霊レヴナントvs神化レヴナント】の対決を見られる時が来たのか！！！
Apex: Sube cualquier video   Youtubers: Hoy se se come pichula soy el unico latinoamericano aqui y no me siento orgulloso de eso
YESSSS THE OG SKINS ARE SAVED LETS GOOO
People are here complaining about recolors forgetting that we're in the midst of a pandemic and that it's harder to do the work involved in making new skins because of it.   smh apex community I though you were better than this.
can we still glitch under the map with these shadows?
Skulltown is back legends 🙌🏼👊🏼
So youll bring back old event skins and RECOLOR THEM. Yet when you bring back voidwalker and give a deal for 3 things for the price of the skin you DONT RECOLOR IT
Starts October 22 and it will run all they way till season 7 which starts on the 3rd of November. Prepare yourself for mass amounts of content for months on end.
wallrunning on shadow = Titanfall (reminds me of titanfall)
FINALLY
weakkkkkk
R.i.p my wallet .... thanks apex
Im nit the only one who sees two Pilots run on a Wall right... Right!
Get your wallet ready.
Finally, Titanfall 2 wall running is here
The skin is sick, like more dark
Товарищи ура, будет бег по стенам ура, ура, ура
epico
octane buff?
Honsetly this shit is kinda getting old and repetitive. If this game doesnt bring something new soon its gonna plummet
Yesssss
Me when I see wall running in apex legends: 👁👄👁
OMG WALLRUNS I KNEW IT YOU GUYS 😁😁😁😁 RESPAWN♥️♥️
SLOL
did loba just get buffed?
the skin reveal was for me literally Caustic WOW Gibby WOW Wraith eh XD
Wallrun ohhh new skin?? I want buy that
Holy hot dayum  *wallrunnin*
Everybody’s gangster till the shadow starts to run on the wall😬

I can imagine the last legend alive in a squad camping.
FINALY!
GOD DAAAAAAMN
HOLY SHIT WALLRUNIIIIING
Wait a minute... Is that an improved Loba tactical?! The bracelet pick-up seems faster, interesting!
SLOL
Didn't we just get aftermarket they giving us the content we need
Loba have buff
The new version of the Wraith skin looks better than the original
Wall running lets go!!
Why don’t the 2 revenants team up to finally find the Hammond storage place where his head is?  Because one is just too cool for that
Damn, they recycled last years event in its entirety.
0:32 first time That I scarred from loba
"resurrected skins" -_-
wall run!!!!!????
Caustic uff its nice
wall running legend confirmed
Too late Apex.
titanfall players: its from me)?
ngl those recolours look really good
Legend: *wallruns* Titanfall players: is that...? *sheds tear*
So Revenant is literally assassin creed
Looks lik we better run
No new skins👎
I’m excited for the LTM’s but I’m annoyed that the skins are just re-skins 😒😒
No bangalore skin??? :((((
Only good thing wall run but skins very dissapointed
PeaceKeeper as ground loot confirmed?!?!?!?
WALLRUN
Hes here
I'm gonna miss that exfil point moments from Shadowfall.... 😔
wall riding?? Licio confirmed?? POG
Fate has brought you back...
we can be spider man
レヴナントくんウキウキで草
Ahh yes... *Albino Wraith*
Hes handsome
Wow that was epic  Revenant job is just beating pathfinder ngl 😂
Was that a peak at a new Revenant finisher at the end?
Leggoooooo
Run on walls : Titanfall 3 confirm
only if this is the second time your playing like
PogChamp    Also, play Titanfall 2
Leave OCTANE alone!!!
WALLRUNNING AND DOUBLE JUMP,      CANT WAIT
I saw Lifeline reviving Loba with shadow power and got scared that being revived by a shadow would turn you into a shadow.
Nobody cares.
When there is wall running  Every titanfall player: MY TIME HAS COME
Not a collection event? That sucks... was looking forward for some Halloween skins
nice discrete loba buff there ;)
Wait there are two revenants now, this is getting out of hand!
damn, revenant was killed by revenant
Titan falling
Ooo my favoryte game mode is come back
Only Rev could announce Fight or Fright honestly.
Please sell them separately to because I just want the lifeline her self
Woo! Can't wait to show these off on my stream. Thank you again for helping me find my wife on this amazing game. <3
WOOOOOOOW
Bro watching this makes me want be a shadow
Titanfall OG's are losing they shit right now bro!!!
Wall running wow :D
I had the expectation that Horizon would have been in here
so i’m guessing switch release is over right? *sigh* oh well :(
The things I like that will be in the event are:  1.The shadows running on the walls 2.Revception 3.Loba will be TERRIFIED 4.Shadow Royale LTM 5.NOT THE SKINS!(except 1 and that is the Bloodhound Skin)
Time to pray the wall running is testing for a new character passive 🙏
Yo
I know spoopy shadow mode and wall running and all that but don't be so excited cuz respawn sure has a thousand problems beside every update which obviously doesn't make it to the trailer
Is no one gonna talk about loba's tactical recovery animation speeding up in this trailer
Bruh it's a revanent event but no skin for revenant
The Zombies can run on walls like in Call Of Duty Black Ops III xD but i want today!
when they recolor skins
TITANFALL REBORN
When is this live
Modo para campear
We gettin some Titanfall2 vibes bois
Hi
Why couldn’t they do this event in World Edge instead. It would’ve been nice to see nightfall there, since we’ve seen many night modes in KC..
Apex: Halloween event   My wallet: My time has come.
Nobody :  Revenant: starts insulting and killing himself
Just seeing the Leviathan's again, it gives me chills. Remembering season 0 first time ever seeing those guys while thinking they would one day destroy us all.😂😩❤
yeees wall runnin.
soo where's Crypto? He's the only legend that didn't show up here. At all.
Respawn should make a *i am beautiful* voice line for revenant
great, just used all my money to the previous event
WTF YOU CAN WALL RUN!?!
fortnite is gay x
Titanfall 2 OG's cant wait to become shadows
Kind of sucks the skins are just re-colors. I was hoping there'd be new skins.
WAIT ACTUALLY WALL RUNNING
yes poggers
THE EVENT STARTS ON MY BIRTHDAY!? BEST. PRESENT. EVER!!
the game is dead 💀
Logik-revenant kill revant from darknees lands🤔
Well here goes another op ability wall running..... Its fine i guess...
My question is can I buy these skins with crafting materials?
so how about 0:19 is it new legend comming
Halloween will always be the best holiday for video games.
Still no Nintendo switch I guess
Once again, mirage dies in a trailer lmao
Imagine playing fortnite in 2020
Both revenants roasting each other gives me life
THIS IS ACTUALLY LEGIT!!!
Entonces....... van a arreglar los servidores?
TF2 players:        It's free real estate
So is that revenants new finisher? Just punch a guy ? Wow respawn
Time to show off my Cod black ops 3 wall running skills. Lol
Yes
Man add solo for God's sake, random squads are so bad at the game
Broo the wall running and the recolored skins are the best part about this event
Omg the hipe is real😍
Apex players. I just want you to know, that the Titanfall 2 movement masters, like myself, will smash you.
Cool
Mismo evento que el año pasado. Aburridooooooo
This looks really cool. I really liked the other event last year
I thought it would be cool for a game mode that isn’t limited time but cycles between the modes such as shadow fall which is personally my favorite thing in this game (:
Absolutely zero hype
still no pathfinder skin???
Ok you are finally adding content, now you could fix the game please?
This is the beddream??
ローバの瞬間移動後の硬直が短くなってる！！やっとちゃんとした上方修正きたね
NICE WALL RUNNING
Apex Making events :😎 Apex Fixing there Servsrs:🤤
Wish it was new skins! But still looks dope
Remember when they said they don’t want to copy anything I guess when a game becomes bad enough that happens           Wait before you dislike I did like apex legends I’m fact I loved it until season 6
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That transition between the 2 Revenant Finishers is so nice
EVENT AFTER EVENT!! THIS IS THE WAY TO GO
WALL RUNNING?!
So are we getting Bangalore's herilom still??
Give octane double jump!
Me: sees wallrunning Also me: *Standby for titanfall* (If you don't get it well it's because there's a leaked audio file in apex where the announcer says: "Standby for titanfall")
PLEASE TELL ME ITS GONNA BE REVENANT HEIRLOOM NOT BANGALORE PLLLS
im crying i NEED that BH skin but im just that broke lol
The next thing you know ~ new event new heirloom more money~
The wall running is like Cod black ops 3, and I fuc%ing LOVE IT.
pk?
The pathfinder skin sucks.
MY BODY IS READY!!! Can't wait to show these skins off on my stream! <3  Thank you Apex for helping me find my wife and for making such a fun and unique game.
0:27 pilots from Titanfall? Cool!
Ok
Revenant heirloom please!
Gib me bangalore hierloom
I would love to have the old shadow fall on rotation with the shadow royale but it doesn’t look like we’re getting that
No lifeline 🥺😔
Apex: _teammates disconnect_  Also Apex next match: 0:15
APEX DONT BRING BACK THE OLD SKINS BACK YOU CANT DO THIS TO US
Best event ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OMG
Idk why I passed up on the Halloween caustic skin when it first came out, but I'm definitely picking it up now
Me: I'm ready.  My wallet: No, don't do it.
Ok no new skins
I’ll do whatever it takes for that caustic skin
Ah sh*t, here we go again. 😊
Yo this is lit
The recolors look so good
My wallet once more: Please no I have a family
Oh my god, didn't think it'd feel this good to see wall running in Apex 😭
so, it's squads instead of solos now, can't wait to be yelled at, plus wall running hype
НИФИГА СЕБЕ КАКОЙ ТРЕЙЛЕР СОЧНЫЙ, ЖАЛЬ ШО НА САМОМ ДЕЛЕ КУ 10 ФПС))0000))0))0) МОСКВА ПРИУВЕТ, РАСИЯ ВПЕРДЕ!!!
All we loba mains want is a faster animation for the jump drive at least... The cinematic one looks a lot better than in-game, can we have a animation that doesn't get us killed please
The wall running and everyone's voice acting made that trailer for me
How exactly do you break a robot's neck?                 Design flaws, that's how.
Please have mercy on my wallet...
Holy shit they really put titanfall movement on shadows!
soo you guys reamaked the old skins and hope that we buy them?
well well, guess we testing wallrunning.
As a titanfall veteran I can't wait to dunk on these "legends" with the titanfall movement
Lessgo! I've never played the original Shadow LTM so I'm excited
camp in the corner because your team disconnected event
Pathfinder: I’m sorry friend but your going to become a skeleton now  Loba: Hahaha sure
All the titanfall 2 players are gonna be the best shadows
super trailer
Rampart's underpaid editor coming in clutch for us.
Not bed.
can we just talk about they reusing the s3 skins...
its confirmed nothing for crypto this entire season :(((
players: yay, content! youtubers: stonks
yess. loba buff
So is this a bundle or collection event because if it’s a bundle I’m screwed
One question.. why not today?
OMG IS VERY GOOD
wtf zombie are pilots
Ever look at a comment and say..     *Wow I wish I wrote that*
0:33 it’s alive
O MY GOD ITS HAPPENING EVERYONE STAY CALM
HAPPY SPOOK-TOBER
I think the wall running is a test for the new legends passive😳
WALLRUNNING
Excuse me?! What was that zombie pilot? hmmmmm
またパスファをハブるのか？
I'm sorry friend,but you're going to become a skeleton now :)
Will we be able to buy the skins with craft mats?
Your Titanfall 2 pro gamer has arrived did somebody say WALL RUNNING?!?!?!
Dang that caustic recoler be looking kinda hot
Ahh my favorite event returns again welcome PS love respawn and apex Legends

Twitter and instagram comments: DoN’t CaRe  Youtube comments: I CANNOT WAIT! (Even dying makes it fun!)
Respawn plz put refund I don't want my kunai I want pathfinder or blood hound heirloom
WALL RUNNING INTRODUCED?!!!!
I hope there’s a legend that gets Titanfall style wall running but maybe with a cool down to keep it more balanced. Maybe the first ex titans pilot legend. I love it.
I saw Titanfall wall ride
Wallrun baby
Dude and I freaking love Revenant personality!!!!
Man I was hoping a spooky revenant skin but no...
The shadows give me titanfall vibes   This is where we separate the pilots from the grunts
I font see anyone talking about theWALLRUNNIG OH NY GOD
We desperately need Indian servers
There's a new revenent finisher

Respawn : New Event GUYS !!! LOOK LOOK !! Everyone : UWU WALL RUNN!!!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Both Revenants in the same place   Let them fight
I really don't like how they changed up the mode it's not the same
Hear me out guys imagine  revenant said in a intro "I'm the one hiding under your bed teeth right sharp and eyes going red" 1 day before Christmas reference
Where’s the crypto skin at
Wow so lazy, it's Halloween and all they did was just copy n paste last year's event with a few minor tweaks. The amount of potential and possibilities they have with Halloween cosmetics is crazy and all they did was just re-color last year's. So whack. I see people starving and begging for content and this is what people are happy with? Damn Respawn got you by the balls.
Comentario en español que esperabas No bajes más,  hay gente hablando taka taka
Notice how Respawn didn't show off Revenant Halloween skin.. Cuz they know they got lazy and made a weak and lame skin that nobody likes.. Revenant deserves better.
That Wall Run And Double Jump Stand By For TitanFall 🖤🖤
If they see this comment dont make the bundle prices above 30, for the love of god I'm broke 😭💯
WALL. RUNNING. 👀
Revenant causes a paradox and freaking dies
Dracucrypto confirmed

The annoying thing about this event is that now we know that this is canonical to Apex's story so who knows how this will fit in too the greater story.

ANOTHER UPDATE LES GOO
I'm disappointed in the rehashed skins. Kind of kills the vibe
What?! No heirloom?!
I’m happy they reskinned the old skins instead of bringing them back like they did with previous events because I have the og Bloodhound, Caustic, and Gibby fight or fright skins, and was worried I wouldnt feel as special like with the Voidwalker skin (I have the og Voidwalker as well). I’m definitely gonna buy the reskins though, and the new gamemode looks cool af
SKULLLL TOWWNN!!!!!!
Epic game time

Оху еть, бег по стенам завезли
0:19 Is that new octane skin?
(Only for infinity blade fans) who noticed revenant sounds like the god king?
Wait, how did Revenant kill Revenant and not be the boss leader?
It’s back, and deadlier than ever.
Last time I was this early Octane was the new Legend
Did you know that Halloween is for demons so you celebrating the devil. God believes don’t celebrate Halloween
the wall running and rocket jump, yea, we're getting a pilot
Soooo its squads instead of the original solo... Kinda takes the tension off
Yes boyyyyyyy
Gg
I’m early
Always respawn has to do somthing with my credit card
Anyone else notice they had two of the same Legend in one shot. (Revenant I mean.)   I have a theory which I won’t go to into detail for but story wise, I think this where team respawn, story wise, will explain the disappearance of Revenant Prime and show that Shadow world Revenant will be taking his place. (See the season 5 treasure pack story for why I’m proposing this.)
0:42 OMGF WALL RUNNING!!!!!!!!! LETS GO BOIS!!!!!
Titanfall?
Hostia
I stood up when I saw the wall running. Too bad my monitor is busted so Idk if I'll play.
Bad ending: Vives en Latinoamérica y no puedes comprar nada de eso

Wall running?! IN APEX LEGENDS!?!? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH

OMG
Revenant don’t even like each other 💀
Wallriding though Im W O K E
Maybe i can finnally get a spoopy pathfinder skin
WALL RUNNING IS BACK YAY!!!!!!
This looks cool but shouldn’t they give exclusive skins that are in the trailer to the people that owned the skins from that event and the old ones are in the shop
OMG

YESSSSSASSSSS
If octane could wallrun during the stim, is like the perfect buff
Normally I’d complain about the recycled skins. But I didn’t take of it the first time so I’m actually glad they brought them back. Ima take a L and buy a few lol

In this trailer revenant talks but no skins for him..... Nice
Confieso que se me callo el cepillo de dientes de mi hermana al váter y lo volví a poner sin limpiarlo
This is why I play revenant
These event skins look fire but my wallet aint
They need to stop using the revenant beat down banner pose as a finisher (they also did it in another trailer) if they’re not gonna gives us the option to buy it as a finisher. It looks amazing, it’s so infuriating
DAMN! I didnt Play this Last Year! Now...I CAN FINALLY PLAY IT!
Bro lets goooo
I LOVED shadowfall thank GOD they brought it back
2 events back to back? This is unusual bucko
Es normal esta emocioom OwO
Oh my...

Nah

Wall running just like titan fall I like it

@apex can you guys make an heirloom finisher. When you unlock an heirloom it comes with a special finisher designed for the heirloom

WALLRUNNING????
Back to back events. I ain't complaining.
I missed the "i am beautiful" revenant voice line
I can hear my wallet screaming "NOT AGAIN PLZ!"
HOLY SHIT WALL RUN
OMG YES YES YES WALLRUNNING!!!
gOOD, but where is new map?)))
Fucking yes! Pilot movements baby!
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
The fact that it has been back to back events just blows my mind. But I’m confused, are there not gonna be new skins for each event but instead just recolours?
Spoooooooooooky
Switch users missing everything QQ
Today’s my birthday🥳🥳
titanfall 2 movement for shadows! POGCHAMP
I watched this on Twitter is mirage getting a recolor pls
First mirage now revenant who is next?
I love this new take on the gamemode. Maybe people wont leave like they did last time. Was almost impossible to win as a shadow.
The skins look sick!
