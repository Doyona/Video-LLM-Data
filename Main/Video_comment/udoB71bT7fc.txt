The furry i mean furry i mean furry i mean Fury has been playing in my head time to time :D
<333
Jacob is my warewolf ❤
1:00 THERE'S FAIRIES NOW
even though the director in my opinion on some certain movies with looking for edward's actor should have went to korea and screen any of what was and or is strill exo before exo was famous in k-pop i can't stand that one ceertain gag of an english actor that sucks https://youtu.be/MxWUcafw7yE?si=suvJLHyf0Vf3iyVhttps://youtu.be/I3dezFzsNss?si=L7CPeZbsF9iQNzLZc this is betterhttps://youtu.be/gAal8xHfV0c?si=QaHEBSWd5uRUiAmF https://youtu.be/AUs-hBjU9w8?si=EMVo1ptCvStHo1Pthttps://youtu.be/TI0DGvqKZTI?si=kauqjT5LVoxEdfFP
Hating on plad ?! Truly a crime against Lesbians.
My bro said sims more like simps
.....Its giving furries!
This is my least favorite pack. I once tried to make a highschool werewolf and my kid failed at school and kept beating up the teachers because of the werewolf rage moodlet. And everyone hated her because of the constant fear moodlet the sims around her gained
❤
Turns out Greg just needed some Furrapy
0:26 the way i immediately caught that steven universe soundtrack
The lack of tails is crazy. I don’t even like docked tails on dogs. I have some Yorkies with tails so long they whip my legs if they wag next to me. Let the dogs keep their tails. Shortening tails only makes sense for hunting dogs, so they don’t get caught by other animals. That just doesn’t matter for Sims werewolves
Better late than never? LOL.
When I first saw the werewolves? I saw a cat and not a dog. I've seen numerous werewolf and vampire movies, and I can barely relate to either occult forms in the Sims 4. Vampires and werewolves in the Sims 4 are a pain in the neck, weak, and plagued with problems. If I met them in real life? I would probably laugh, especially with the vampire's uncontrollable hissing. The vampires that I've seen in movies, you don't know what they truly are until it's too late. The vampires in the Sims 4, you can spot them from miles away. The werewolves are just a little weirder than the mentally unstable people that I used to monitor, except the werewolves are actually comical. I don't know what Maxis was thinking except where's the money? Don't get me wrong. It's mildly entertaining, but nothing more. I've done a play through with the werewolves for a day or two, but I couldn't continue because there's nothing relatable to real werewolf's lore. It's the same with the vampires. There is so much lore from werewolves and vampires, and Maxis couldn't even give one aspect that I could recognize? Well, maybe the bat form and transferring from a human into an adorable kitty cat without a tail. But, yeah? Major LOL!
"We need some milk." What the heck is from and about? Major LOL!
3:24 no, modern werewolves are also Wolves in a human shape, but they look scary, not...what Sims 4 did
The immortal enemies...... woww....... yes. This line/pun hunted me so much XD
this video has me dead 💀
Hey, I don't know if you noticed, but sometimes there is a small red dot that appears in the middle of the screen when the camera is on you; it ranges between being just over your hair to the top of your face. I just wanted to say something because I noticed that while watching your video - I'm a huge fan, and I love your content. Keep up the good work; as they say, masterpieces take time, like these awesome videos ^-^ (I know it's not the most recent video but I noticed it in this one.)
STEPH IM WATCHING THIS ON MY MOMS OLD CHROMBOOK IM SO PROUD OF MYSELF FOR FIGURIMG IT OUT
Yay....another ALL FURRIES ARE WEIRD  video.....YouTube surely needs one of those, every 10 seconds.....well. another channel to ADD to my not recommend list😊
Demi Lovato the werewolf LMAOOOOOOO
Your query strikes an resonant chord within the chambers of my intellect. A multitude of affirmations dance upon the delicate threads of my conciseness, each whispering their assent in the hushed tones of a reverent confession. Does a bird seek refuge in a chimney pot? Does a street urchin cover a crust of bread? Does the moon wax and wane in the night sky? This my dear fellow with a measured breath and a reverent nod, as surely as the sun rise in the east, my answer is an unequivocal.
13:41 Ja-could have though
6:37 Yay Pregnant!
I totally didn't find this by searching "sims 4 furries"... AND I DON'T REGRET IT
i LOVE the cupcakKe in the background
I almost called moonwood mill    *furrywood mill* 😔
real ones know its sundays
DEMI LAVATO??????? I just screamed at the top of my LUNGS
Not her calling Tyler Lockwood feral
The developers literally just played The Quarry and went eith that 😂
1:22 PLEASE PUTTING TWICE MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND IS BEYOND IRONIC💀💀💀  edit: ESPECIALLY WHILE TALKING ABOUT GAYS
PLUMBERELLA PIPES 🤣🤣🤣
Furries either hate or will give birth for this pack. Oh god this pack has some problems with the "P" fetish...
14:41 HELP MY NAME IS ESME AND I GOT SO CONFUSED FOR A SECOND
i love me some twilight content but the cherry on cake was defo "what's the prob, dog?" liz gillies my queen
how does steph come up with these ideas lol amazing
Ok but we can wicked whim the werewolfs tho?
The Taylor swift album is crazy but I love ts and Steph
As a furry I think this video is absolutely hilarious 😭
I love her videos because she's just too damn funny 😀 The editing, the little song snippets in between, the jokes...perfection.
Steph I do really like your content, but I have to say that this video's jokes and Ideas are copied exactly from @FakeGamerGirl 's Videos about the Werewolf pack. Especially the furry jokes.
Amazing vid! Loved the Minecraft sounds XD storytelling really good too hah
MUMMY I MISS YOU POST MORE 🫵🏽☹️😞😔😮‍💨😫🫣
peepee poo poo
Is that fancy by twice I'm hearing?😍💅
Just love your content 😂
Well, I have never seen youtubers speaking into vibrator instead of a mic. It seems this model is able to fuck ears as well.
The only time I tried playing with this pack, my werewolf, whom had a daytime job, you know, got temperament that makes her gain fury when working. Then, she got another one that made her gain fury when she was sleeping during the night. And if her fury gets maxet out while she's at work, which takes about two hours to happen, she comes back home and can't go back to work for the day. So basically, that made the gake unplayabke for me since she couldn't work, so she couldn't make money, and there was no way to get rid of the temperaments. I don't like cheating qnd hardly ever do but this time I had too... idk how this is supposed to be fun.
TS3 Player: What mod did you install? TS4 Player: It's an official pack TS3: I don't believe you TS4: I play on a hecking PS4 MATE
1:21 CUZ YOU KNOW I FANCY YOU
I am so sad that werewolves don't have tails. :(
Ur videos are so good fm
You have such American humor
werewolves are actually kinda cool despite them wearing furry outfits
As a card carrying Lumberjack Lesbian I am shocked by your disrespect of plaid
Does this mean that we canonically have a sims 4 omegaverse? DO WE HAVE CANONICAL SIMS WEREWOLF HEATTT???
the twilight jokes-- i can't
THE FUCKING TWILIGHT REFRENCES😭😭😭
love the furries 😍😍
missed your videos
I cannot stand looking at the werewolves because the only thing I think is furries. They're so gross but in the wrong way
Only reason why I'm still playing Sims 4 is because of this pack.
i will say, when i first saw this pack trailer i was like.... FURRIES?
I think they tried Werewolf from Vam Helsing 2004 and failed😂
good god girl i love your content but you completely roasted the aesthetic of the pack lmfao meanwhile i think its the coolest shit we ever got, peace
WEREWUSSY
Any Rory Oaklow's enjoyers here?
WHY AM I STILL GETTING KRISSED HELP love to see a swiftie 😭
The Attack Titan roar at 9:47 😍
ur videos are so entertaining AND give me a good peak at the packs before i purchase. UR GREAT
alyssa edwards
The amount of time I soent trying to find mods to make the wolves look  more like werewolves  and not people in cheap furry costumes
Take a shot (of water, hydrate or die-drate) every time she days furry
YOU LOOK LIKE THE BLACK HAIRED GIRL IN RIVERDALE 😨
I WAS NOT EXPECTING TO BE KRISSED
I am convinced that the leaks are planned.
…….. yeooooooooooo…. Idk what I was expecting but I wasn’t expecting that
u referenced taylor AND teen wolf
steph ur my idol
Hands down this is the best sims content creator
this pack is honestly perfect for trailer park/ trap house builds.... i use the library as a gang hq ;P
I'm pretty sure there was actually at least one furry who worked on this pack. No joke. I saw them tweet about it around the time this pack came out.
today i learned its hard to write fanfiction while watching steph
anyone else here because the newst vid got age-restricted 😭
I was always a team Jacob guy, even though I really don't care for the movies in general and never read the books. The movies really didn't help sell it to be honest...  The only thing I really liked about them was shirtless jacob. Seriously, dude is sexy as hell...
This was and is iconic
Steph is as scheduled as my sleep schedule 😁
some times i forget steph exists and then i remember abt her and im like "well lets see what she uploaded in these past 5 months" and she only uploaded 1 video :,)
Omg ur outfit is so beautiful!🌺❤️
Omg shellsea theme
THE CAR ACCIDENT SCENE EDITING, I'M SCREAMING
When Sim Jacob ran from around the house in 6:56 I SCREAM LAUGHED
The intro can't stop ringing in my head
i really hate these new trend in videos that have all these random cuts it gets annoying after a while though i will admit must take forever to edit lol but its just annoying. it implies your audence is too daft to pay attention to a video that ou have to have some random sh8T happen every 2 seconds why is this such a trend of late lol
Steph is as consistent as my sleeping schedule
Steph is as consistent and my love life
i need steph to create the royal family and do a hunger games type thing with the extreme violence mod. it feels like what all of us sinners need (def not an idea brought on by the queen's death)  and it would be on brand for both the family (drama) and steph
I hope you go back to posting once a month❤️ you are a content creator DONT forget your authenticity
I don't care about sims. I want steph to read the news.
The editing skill. The script. Everything is PERFECTION
OMG STEPH0SIMS IS A ONCE
YOUR VIDEOS ARE ART <3
I have a question and if somebody could answer I would really appreciate it. (My sims stopped working, I need advice.)  So, recently my game stopped working. Whenever I try to load into a household, it gives me an error code and takes me back to the map. I’ve done the 50/50 method, taken out all of my broken mods but nothing works. Most of my game is mods so I don’t think I could play the game without them. (CAS is really important in my game) This happened around when the werewolf pack came out. Does anybody have any tips? I’ve looked online and taken out all the mods that were said to be causing issues, but it still hasn’t resolved. I’ve repaired the game as well.
1:20 fancy by twice
Steph0sims is The funniest Sims YouTuber
You look like someone in my highschool
1:24 is steph a once ??😭
OMG SHE PLAYES FANCY BY TWICE SKDJSJANEJDJJSSJSH  Anyways love you steph ur so funny
steph. you have no idea the amount of pain i endured while waiting for the moment you post again. ily.
I have an assignment that’s due text week.
I’m gonna tell my kids in the future this was Twilight.
I’ve missed you 😩🤰🏻
THE NINTENDO DOG GAME CLIP WAS SO NOSTALGIC
1:03 Fr can I just re-create ihascupquakes series from Sims 3 and have FAIRIES AND HORSES SHIT!!!!!!!!!!!
The "L in LGBT stands for Lycanthrope" is such a clever ass joke.
i always have to turn down my volume when I watch steph
1:20 Fancy you!
Honestly let's stop complaining about her not posting this is a treat she's on a another level this is a holiday happy Steph day  EDIT: We should make Steph day a thing also shes an icon we can't have to much or wed crash  Second edit: Steph is kinda like rich chocolate you eat to much and you'll get sick.    Happy Steph day again
i got an add of an animation of Justin Bieber singing baby before the video started. great start
she had rent to pay so she uploaded 💀
ouuu it's been 2 weeks and it's still sitting at 200k views this consistency has not been good for her
When you said enemies to lover; I knew that you were a person that would get my follow😅
ngl i don't understand why they don't just let sim werewolves be wolves, since every time they've released them it's post cast/dogs, so they have existing large dog models they could use to make the wolf form from...................................but naw i guess furries and weird unshaven people is the way to go
I was expecting high school but this is fine
stephs hair looks so good it's making me want to dye mine red
Oh, wow! That was so funny
yall r sleeping on "the BIG.... the BAD.... the WOOOOLF... greg"
I LOVE U STEPH
Didn't even start the video but holy hell that's a gorgeous woman love the red hair wow
The blood suckers and the moon f- omg
haha so true bestie <3
when steph said body scars the only thing that played on my mind was "baddle scarz🤠"
wild editing
1:24 there was tice playing... steff a twice stan confirmed ?
QUEEN OF EDITTING 👑
Where we’ll see how well for a pull out via service world pack yup I got a pull it out I’ll see you in the world to see
God I missed this
The halestorm music killed me xd
666th comment xx
I DIDNT BELIEVE IT
i love the intro LMAO
Ngl steph you're just like my period. You disappear for months then show up when I least suspect it
This was so fun. You should do more movies like this.
luv ur makeup and hair
When I went for my ADHD diagnosis, I shouldve just shown them Steph's videos and said "this is what my brain is like..."
and she returns when we needed her the most <3
This is the first video of this person's that I was recommended by the algorithm and now I've got "run it down my vagina" stuck in my head lol. Thanks.
OMG!!! THE BITCH IS BAAAAACK!!!!!
yay! glad you're back. i missed you so muchh!!! hope you start uploading more often, but literally i don't care when you upload bc it's like xmas morning
My toes curled seeing u uploaded
I was today years old when I found out the intro is some days instead on sundays
I was out for a week and this happend
She’s alive ⁉️😍
my parents were aguing while this was going on 😍😍😍
The teen wolf references 👍
4min in and the number of jokes and memes etc references per seconds have me brain dead (people with adhd must be thriving!) but it's so much fun lol!
I love that I absolutely can *NOT* watch Steph0's videos with anyone else in my vicinity 💀❤️ the queen of editing.
It's giving Tony the Tiger
this is the first time ive ever stumbled on your channel… the vibes are great
God I wish she'd post more.
why are you the funniest person alive
Can't wait to watch the High School Years video on freaking Christmas lol
The old leader Demi lovato ajjqjajaja
wow i found your channel literally today and you give me fakegamergirl vibes
Steph gives us a video and I’m 10 seconds in and just in love with her hair all over again. I’ve decided the video is elite already
Steph twice Stan ??!!
I tend to hate over dramatic editing that happens every few seconds, but when Steph does it, it’s actually funny. Idk how she does but she’s hilarious
why didn't I get a notification?? :((((
Stunning queen you slayed…. You slayed too hard 😵😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰
how has Trish not seen these yet
i feel like these have just become poetry in a video form and im here for it
Ok Steph. You've outdone yourself. This is your best video. I nearly screamed and choked on my diet soda. Thank you.
omfg the fucking Twilight* blue filter on Steph in the Edward reveal :'D
Never have I been happier that I clicked on a video
I think I had too many of those colourful mushrooms !!!1!!!1 I hallucinated that Steph actually made a video that would never happen
As a chaotic neutral, I appreciate this chaotic energy.
the random clip of fancy by twice
1:22 TWICE AAAAHHHH
I love this bitch so much y'all 😭😭 she makes me laugh so much I'm so happy she posted
i love your story telling and actually playing the game and not just going off the trailer lol
I was born and raised in the state Twilight was based in. This is absolutely PNW culture with all the plaid and lumberjack lmao.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Happy birthdag!!! From you're South African subscribe hope you have a fucking lovely time.
you're so real baby
WHERE HAVE U BEEN IVE MISSED YOU SO MUCH!
This video is absolutely amazing
Only she can review a pack that’s 3 months old and make it entertaining
Sims 3 occults are still superior sorry not sorry
You searched up pregnant furry art for this video.          Will god forgive you?
warewussy
Steph just sometimes appears in my recommended and I'm like 'oh yeah she exists'
I really loved this pack too like it’s the most fun I’ve had in the sims in like. So long
Queen of posting every 4 months and still reaching 100k views the longevity😍
your editing skills are top tier
STEPH STARTED PLAYING FANCY AT 1:23 HELLLO???
You made this pack look good 😆
I love the ending to trishes story. Obviously a better one than in twilight.
I wish I could see how many edits you have on this
A truly gripping tale, Steph. Well done. lol
Bit late innit babes
Love this from you
does Steph realise if she uploaded more frequently she would DOMINATE the sims/youtube community  she is the black sheep we all crave,  PG rated content has left the chat.
Funny Series Idea: Tisha Potatas becomes a mum in a short lifespan save file and tries to have ten generations of kids. Lol. Love the video
Alice!
She is consistent actually, she posts every 4 months 😍🤪
This was the best twilight fan-fiction ever thank you Steph
This is everything I wanted and more from a werewolf gameplay
The award for best editing, writing, and narrating goes to..
omg not fancy playing when she talks about lgbt furries
Steph0 so consistant, she can post a video with dead memes even when the meme lasted an entire lifetime
SHES BACKKKKK
the editing and sound effect and music choices i can’t
These “wolves” 🤢 🤮
Omg the seasonal Steph0 video is here
Stephs are the only reviews I need
Her videos always make my day especially her humour and the editing👌😂
Steph needs months to regain at least one brain cell after traumatizing us by opening her mind. <3
YOU DESERVE GRAMMYS, EMMYS, GOLDEN GLOBES, OSCARS, AND A NOBEL PRIZE FOR THIS ONE LMFAOOOOOOOO
I wasn't sure that the whole "the werewolves are straight up just furries" thing was intentional until I saw the legitimate werewolf smut fics in the game. EA knew what they were doing (for once) and it scares me edit: I forgot that these videos are an emotional rollercoaster and I'm here for it honestly
12:55
keeping the 4 months tradition 😍
Do the high school next lol
yay! a video i can watch over and over until she uploads again in 3 months😍
love your videos!!!! can't wait for the next one.
😂😂😂😂
Stephanie Meyer’s character assassination of Jacob in Eclipse is the worst thing she’s ever done.  She KNEW everyone liked Jacob better. RIP Jacob’s reputation, he will be missed.
tisha going into heat wheres her alpha to take care of her 😩
Help i got Twilight nostalgia from this video.
DID ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THE VECNA CLOCK NOISE RIGHT AT THE START LMAO???
I was not expecting to hear Twice in a Steph video but here we are
Im a new subscriber, and I litterly can't with how you edit your videos 😂😂😂😂😂😭😭
OMGGG SOMETHING POSTED ON MY BIRTHAY!!!!! YASSSS
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Best sims4 video yet

A masterpiece as usual
This video is freaking chaos and i love it so much
steph is as consistent as my mental health
Welcome Back!!!!!
Does anyone know what the song playing at 10:28 is?

Ayyyyyyyy! Best notification to receive
bitch you are late by one expansion lmaoooooo miss your video thoo thank you so much!!!
My brain cant keep up at this point xD
sorry i had to rub my eyes a few times to convince myself that steph did in fact upload a new video
Steph reminds me of my attention span it Dissapears like dad then randomly comes back🧌
I do have been missing steph
😍😍
yasss the a in lgbtqia stands for anthropomorphic animals !!
After seeing this video, I felt so motivated. It changed my whole life, now I’m a successfull person. I got 10 olympic gold medals, 6 oscars, 7 nobel prizes. Next year I'm planning to buy the moon. It all happened because of you. Thank you so much
I love the upload schedule, it's like theorionsounds. The videos are rare but genius
they look horrible oh my god
I dont even play the Sims, but every time you upload a video I have to watch it *immediately*.
STEPH!!!!! 🙏🥳❤️
Steph is that bestfriend that people call weird but it's them that are weirdos
I love her. I love her references. I just freaking love her content.
PLS I WAS SO SURPRISED WHEN I HEARD FANCY IN THE BACKGROUND LMAOO
Do we tell her there is another pack or do we nod and smile ?
Who is this
Did she just come out?
This is a true story: so yesterday i was feeling really down. I have a “friend” who is constantly hot and cold with me since a dumb fight i long since apologized from last year. They had blocked me again and i was feeling really depressed. Fast forward to 11pm im having trouble falling asleep so I go to youtube. First thing I see Steph0sims 6 hours ago. I clicked instantly and shortly felt better. I say this and ill say it again. Steph only comes back when we really truly need her.
Is this a dream...did Steph, returned from beyond  🤩🤩
STEPHHHHH I MISSED UUUUUUUUU
OMG SHE UPLOADED 😍😍😍
omfg no theyre literally screaming the entire CAS experience and I was so ready to end game when I first started lmfaooo
the photo of Renesme still creeps me tf out all these years later 😂😂😂😂
This is the only sims review I'll ever need
YOUR BACK
another banger from the queen of england herself
omg your mind
Oh finally Steph, one of the few funny and realistic simmers
Thank you for acknowledging us furries as part of the lgbt community<3
Did you play nintendogs as a kid too or was that footage randomly picked?
i’m vomiting from excitement for this video. gagging. screaming. crying ❤️
great vid!! see you in 8 months x
YES
is this your coming out video as a bi? 😳 congrats queen we're so proud of you!!!!!! 🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈
Your commentary , the sound effects,  and all the references you fit into one video gets me every time 😂💗
I literally can't express how much I was hoping for another video and its on my favourite sims pack and my favourite sims youtuber I'm just over the moon :)
PLEASE WHAT IS THAT SONG CALLED?!! 10:22
My illness are cursed and crops are watered
Next video will be on Christmas...
I would let Jacob smash in his wolf form 😋
They really just copied forks lmao
The slay is astronomical
Fun Fact: There's a new object called "The Tiny Fungus Among Us Terrarium" in this pact. Yes, it is real and yes, it is an among us reference. The decription is "the terrarium is looking pretty suspiciously cute. Look how tiny it is! Definitely is not the impostor. Just... don't set it down near any vents." I wish this was just an acid dream.
ITS ALWAYS A GOOD DAY WHEN YOU UPLOAD THANK YOU FOR BLESSING US
see yall in 3 months :D
when steph uploads it makes life worth living another year
Sims really fully added the omegaverse into game play and acted like we asked for it
omg so aesthestic 😍😍

Ngl this really makes me want to play the sims
steph i remembered u existed and then u just posted omg

WHY DO I KEEP GETTING KRISSED EVERYWHERE
Shes backkkkk!!!
Omg both oli and Steph stepped out of the cave to bless us with a video in the last couple of days.
Just take my like and sub!🙂❤️
YASSSSSSSSSSS🔥🔥😭 Thank you Steph❤️
STEPHHH
MY FIRST UPLOAD THAT I CAUGHT WHEN IT WAS RELEASED 💅
Steph is like my mental illnesses they leave for a couple months then come back and slay
I forgot how much I missed these monstrosities
I look forward to the high school review, maybe christmas.
At least before Steph’s videos were at least 30 mins long but now they’re 20 mins 😭😭 jk I love you Steph and love your vids even more xoxo
Steph should change her intro to “steph0 does a video…once every three months🎶”
the queen hath returned
😩 the lighting is 💋
SHES BACK BITCHES
always get a snack for your videos they are so good
Had a fucking awful night, Steph used her superpowers to sense that we needed her to return I’m five minutes in and already cackling
Lowkey wish the werewolves looked like they do in teen wolf or vampire diaries like steph showed because I'm in the process of making beaocn hills and I have to substitute so much lol
Finally steph uploaded again!
this is art
I knew she'd come through for this pack. she had to.
The effort you went to for this is impressive. You even did the Cullen house! I was not expecting that.
Hail the queens cumback 😍😍
See you in 4 months dad!
Actually, I don't hate how werewolves look  It's better than ts3
I can't imagine how long it takes for you to not only get thru the gameplay, but then the editing?? So  much work! You do such a great job!!
Lovers to Enemies. my favourite romance stories
Oh my god she posted! Msjejdnwjaknda about time bitch 😂😂❤
This is always worth the wait 🤣💜
Finally the first Sunday in 4 months 🥰 I can’t wait till the next one ❤️
hhhhhh
That hair colour suits her so well ❤️
UR BACK U HAVENT POSTED IN SO LONG
my parents aren’t getting divorced, their just being lovers to enmities!
I just screamed so loud at the sight of this at the top of my screen
I mean it is Sunday you post but Sunday is every week not once a month, but we love you and your content makes up
i love this villian era hair
Lovers to Enemies when?
why are the two wolf packs literally amnity vs dauntless
The time it took to make this. 😵
Your back !!!!
Please post more, your videos are everything! i understand playing though an entire pack like this video takes a long time but I’m sure I speak for everyone when I say we’ll watch anything from you (gameplay, building, whatever you feel like!) of course only if it’s something you’d enjoy
But when the world needed her most, she returned. I still believe that somehow, Stepho will remain to save the world.
lol I love this
so glad for a new steph video on my last day of summer break 🥰🧌
Steph this was a whole nother level of review as usually lol love it 💕
the way fancy by twice played when she was talking abt the gays, they’s and furries i’m dying 😭😭
Best. Werewolf. Review. Ever.
"Werewolves also have a furry-- I mean furry-- I mean furry-- I mean furry-- I mean furry-- I mean FURY........ metre"
bestie i’m so glad ur back!! it feels like it’s been forever since we last saw you. literally so much has happened in the meantime :$ i literally almost died lmao yas 💅
Steph’s schedule is the only cycle I’ll ever wait for
Great retelling of twilight. Such a better retelling then the actual story.

Fuck now I wanna rewatch and read twilight
I got a prolife add on this lmao. Couldn’t be stephs videos
"The Werewolf Reveal!"  LOL after the NEXT pack has been released 🙂
I NEED STEPH TO MAKE A SERIES ABOUT THE WEREWOLF AND VAMPIRE WAR

the lycanthropy word play is golden 🥰
love ea catering to both the furries, the bdsm AND *diet* lycanthrope communities in one single pack  12:09 in the words of our lord and saviour Katniss Everdeen, I volunteer as tribute.
Love you gurl ✨👯🖤 hahaha mint video amazing editzzzzzz as per 🙌🏽
I love the look of the werewolves because they're so weird looking, but I hate that they don't wear shoes.
Omg qween dropped yay
What a beautiful wet ass story.
U late as hell there’s a new pack out already
I was gonna have my 3 am mental breakdown, but it can wait <3🧎
I missed Steph and her dead pixel 😂😂😏
Absolutely delightful - no need to apologize for the delay, it's worth it lol

Steph is like that one sibling at a family reunion, there is never any expectations for her to be there but when she is she steals the show with her brilliance.
Why was I so invested in this story? 🤣
How am i earlier?
can't wait til she uploads the high school pack in 2023 ♥
FUCK YEAH STEPH I'M SO EXCITED!
there are so many sound effects
STEPH
Steph is literally one of the only YouTubers that can make me CACKLE
As a furry, im so blessed for this content steph 😌
cant wait for the high school pack review next year!!💕
Ugggghhhhh your videos are never a disappointment.
Steph uploading is like getting picked up from school early when you didn’t expect it <3
Steph upload consistency is like my baking ❤️ love her
Screaming, thank you, queen!

Lmao i cant with cuppcakke mixed with the twilight theme song 😂😂
steph is consistant as my period
I can't believe I've just been krissed in a furry video
this was so fucking chaotic
i hate the werewolves pack because werewolves go from 0-100 super quick. It's like chill buddy, you were just doing homework, why are you now glowing red and about to go apeshit?

YES NEW STEPH VIDEOOOOOO
STEPH HAS RISENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
I fucking love your videos steph
Thank you Steph, I knew this pack review would be worth the wait!
Steph where the hell have you been loca
This is the best video i’ve seen all day and i’ve never seen this youtuber before
stephosins
Not the diva cup 🤣
needa ya
the queen has returned to my screen
I don't even play the sims usually, but every time Steph uploads it makes my day 🤩 she's so funny and charismatic I'd watch her talk about anything
2 uploads this year were being well-fed
"let me be your diva cup" 💀💀💀💀💀💀
As a furry... Wicked Whims installed and updated!
This video is basically Twilight Fanfic... Change My Mind.
she had ended  3 month streak
so high school review in december? yayy 💕
She hath risen
i missed you my love 💔
I think the werewolves look fine in Sims 4. They certainly look better and more like wolves than in Sims 3. Also, with the no tail thing, that's actually correct. Werewolves in most cultures are indistinguishable from actual wolves apart from the fact Thatcher have no tails.
This amount of content I am sister eating sister gobbling it up
when this pack came out i immediately thought of steph!
Can't believe lesbians are being erased from the community like this 😔 guess we have to cancel wolves now girlies
Hi steph we both have red hair now ❤️👍
I screamed and scared my whole family when I saw that u uploaded a new video 😅🥰💖😫🥲
1:22 THE TWICE IN THE BACKGROUND- 💀
At this point Steph just has her hair dyed differently in every single video.
I can’t wait to see Trisha Paytas get Highschool INSTA BADDIED up✨ And then get canceled.
Fatherless? Nah we are Stephless
STEPH OMDS GET UR ACT TOGWTHER
Every month steph uploads a video, is a good month
🎉😄🎉
"let me be your diva cup girl" i think i've had a heart attack
Steph is as regular as my period 😊 x, I am a male x
the way i gasped when i saw this in my recomended
no one has a more consistent upload schedule than steph <33
thank you for coming back😭
I knew you were gonna call them furries.
YAS SLAY!!
stepho do you play wolfquest ???
Lycan-subscribe 💀
Great video see you again in four months
im so sorry i just can't see the wolves without seeing sims in furry costumes..
I had just liked the video seconds before getting Krissed. Down bad
omg I missed you so muchhh 😭🧡

How can someone have so much GOOD meme knowledge as stepho does? Every single meme reference makes me laugh wtf 😂😂 Great video as always, sister sinner

Always top-tier content THANK YOU STEPH 💕
I'm high as a kite and have now rewinded to hear the intro again several times. Someone end me.
ive genuinely aged a year since you last posted. slay.
The werewolves are hot and I’m tired of pretending they’re not
It takes this long.. because of all the goddamn brilliant references and puns! - it is ALWAYS WORTH THE WAIT!
I am a sub, whenever Steph calls, I’m sprinting at a moments notice.
Guys, she's not late, her wifi is just too slow...
well it was nice seeing you my sinners and sisters, see you all next year when steph uploads.
Steph editing deserves an award honestly 😌
IM GOING TO MCDONALDS WHEN I GET BACK IM GOING GOBBLE DOWN MY MEAL WATCHING THIS VIDEO
when we needed her most she finally appeared out of thin air
Wish they'd make mermaids not shit, they're so boring that steph mentioned _plantsims_ and not them
Loved this!
The Sims 4 furry, I mean furry, I mean fuRRY I MEAN FURRY I MEAN werewolves pack
STEPH HELLOOOOO
The fact that the tile of this video is exactly what i called the pack when it came out is comical

Steph im so sorry, i was the one that said bussy and the beast.   was i wrong tho?

I am convinced that Steph made about 100 videos ten years ago and then died, and someone has just been staggering the videos she made back in 2012.
