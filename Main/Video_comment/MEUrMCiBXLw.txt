มีความสุขทุกครั้งที่ดู
united could only imagine to have such a great owner like this 😔
This is  a real family cub,kudos to all Leicester fans out there!And ..oh yes,to the players/the board ,congrats.
🙏❤🌐
Wow so rare to see good owners
It’s such a beautiful thing that the team and the manager/staff and the owners are so close like family. Just a shame all of the other clubs aren’t like it. It’s what I hate about West Ham, the owners don’t give a f**k. So Leicester have every football fans hearts ♥️
Emotional!
น่ารักเชียว😄😄
So I love two bosses: him, and Roman Abramovich)))
He is cute)))
So in love with this club 🥺❤️
Money doesn't win football. Love does. ❤️
Tears for Vichai
Real loser club mentality
Best owners in the Premier league, as a west ham fan I dream of owners like these. Amazing people 👏🏻❤️
Special moment for me as a Leicester fan
Coming from an arsenal fan, i wish we get this greedy voiceless kronke out and get an owner that cares about the club and the players and fans like Leicesters owner .-.
Underdog by kasabian in the background aswell perfects this video
I’m so jealous  Fair play to them  👏 👏  Makes me realise how far arsenal have fallen
May be a bit biassed , but don't think any owners could do more for a football club than Khun Vichai and his son Khun Top. Thanks Vichai for making us proud !
rio is quick to point out good owners quicker than he is to spread his arse for mike ashley
His father paved the way and Leicester is one of the best run club in the PL
Beautiful moment always
คุณวิชัยบอกแล้วว่าจะทำทีมสู้กับเชลซีให้ได้เพราะแค้นที่เชลซีไม่ให้เกียรติเขาในฐานะแฟนบอลเชลซีซะใจจริงๆ
Love this
Best wishes from Thailand
YOUR FATHER DIED BUT  THE  LEICESTER  HAVE THE BEST PLAYERS
Congrats, Leicester! It's amazing! 💙🦊🏆👍🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
เรารักคุณนะคุณวิชัย​คุณต๊อบ
Cant stand football but even I gave this a 👍brilliant video
รักคนอื่นว่ายากแล้วทำไห้คนอื่นรักสิยากกว่าเป็นล้านเท่า..สุดยอดครับ
The Perfect Boss!!
A Buddhist thai owner brings leicester city making hystory again and again..  His kamma and his team good kamma brings this club win..
He is so humble ❤
👍 Leicester city🤟💖😆😄😅😂💝💯... FC.🇹🇭
For vichai🙏🙏🇹🇭🇹🇭
슈퍼손은 트로피 언제 들어보나 😐
The crooked marble operationally argue because consonant premenstrually shrug below a absurd drug. smelly, naive meteorology
The Leicester City culture is unique. Every professional footballer of course plays for money, but Leicester players use their owner's faith in them to give them that extra edge to perform better. They play like they are representing their family in every game. It is a football culture that can get the best out of a team without relying on purely money as motivation.
I'm a fan of Olympique de marseille , and i'am jealous of leiceister , not their players even if they are better than ours , but that spirit is the kind of things that make me love football .
This man and his late father are loved by all the players and back room staff
ยินดียิ่งจากประเทศไทย Heartiest congratulations from Thailand.
mentality of owner make Leicester a big success . Every player,who  comes  to play like a warrior because there is an emotion which drives each player into a beast mode .
Football won in 2016 n now it wins
สุดยอด🇹🇭🙏🏻🤟✌️💝
As a Thai alumnus of University of Leicester, studying there in Leicester in 2016 when the 5000/1 miracle happened, I could say that time was and has been the most memorable year of my life and the day the Foxes won FA cup brought me right back to that emotional moment again.
This is how it should be with every owner of a football club, he clearly loves everything about Leicester and not just the bank balance
So many rich people just owning their club as their investment tools....but him, as an owner, he loves it so much, he care about it...so unlucky if his dad was rejected by Chelsea for buying this club...then this happen.. So much respect for someone who love football more than just their business
That's the difference between an Asian employer n a western employer. Asian employers ( most ) treat their employees as friends n like family. Western owners ( most ) treat their employees as employees. I'm the boss so I don't go down to your level. That's the difference.
Nunca me cansare de ver esto, gracias por esta temporada 😍😍😍
Nice respect to Top, holding down his family legacy.
the owner isn't corrupt like 99.99% of the corrupt mofos
This is real futball club👌🏆 Business club please back off..
OMG !!!!!😱 Very good 👍👍👍👍👍
Wish Man Utd have an owner like that
Owner Different :))
This made my day ngl. Never been so happy for a chairman.. respect’a. ✊🏽
He is not just the owner of the club he is fan too  congrats Foxes
Tears in my eyes, amazing
Imagine kroenke or glazers doing this..
ดีใจกับเจ้าของคนไทย ดีใจกับแฟนเลสเตอร์ คนไทยเข้ามาพัฒนาสร้างทีม ท้ายสุดอังกฤษได้ประโยชน์ ยินดี
Bayern munich owners are fine as well
1:15 Manchester United football club manager
This makes me cry because foxes have these owners and me as a red have Glazers..
Don’t even like football and this was decent ;)
Absolutely love this... This is what football is... Just wish this succubus kronke would do one. Well done LCFC 👍
So wish my team I support had that a owner that cares
in one word..brilliant.
If glaziers come on pitch the fans would run on to lynch them
น้ำตาใหลตามเลย
Thai.......
Khun Top is the no.10 ricest owner of football club in the world. if he continue managing his team like this, Leicester City will be one of the bighest football team in the future without a doubt.
This is special, such a great club
ทำไมน้ำตาใหล
This is amazing ! I love this game !
A son like his father takes over from were his father left from and make his father proud
Football culture resembles that of a cult.   If people used all that energy and zest for something useful then the world would be a better place.   I mean footballers get paid absolutely ridiculous amounts f money for kicking a ball.
I am Thai, Khun Top, he and his family and King Power Company, Donate lots of money to charity in Thailand. He is a new generation, Have new ideas And very friendly.
O club  que a gente aprendeu amar
What a nice gesture from the players towards the owner. Really happy for Leicester and Brendan Rodgers, they deserved to win and they deserve to play in CL next year. Respect from Liverpool fan.
Gesture at 1.04 towards the sky was 👍🙏😭
Such heart warming sight. Congrats Leicester.
Well done to Leicester,
How people can dislike this video
Leicester is role model for PL clubs without relying heavily on their owner pocket to reach the top. Cheap, smart signing from money they got from TV and UCL to build a competitive team. After myriad of disappointing managers, they believed in Brendan's quality, after his ill-fated spell at Liverpool and dominated "small" league, and they reap what they sow.
As a man united fan I feel happy for a club to have a owner that cares for their club
ฉันรักสโมสรเลสเตอร์ซิตี้ 💙💙💙
Quien es este asiático?
This is so god damn great!!!
I'm football fan: Great moment for Leicester and all real fans. Congrats  🦊
A weekend where the spirits of the dead was watching. Leicester owner  father and allison father 🤔🙏
Well done Leicester. From a Leeds Fan.
Im a man utd fan.ifvi was a leicester fan i would be proud of your owner a shining example of a famiky rum club where owner cares.👏👏👏👏👏👏
Just like his father
I love julia
🎉Congratulations🥳🎉🥳🎉🥳🎉 Liescter city...  Good one fellas.
Top man
A brilliant moment for a great Club. Congratulations to Leicester City.
this shittles my sniddles...wonderful
The owner age is only 35.
I actually smile watching this. And as a Man United fan, I can only smile...
I'm a Gooner and I'm jealous!
since when was ryan reynolds a leicester fan? 0:10
A brilliant gesture, Brendan Rodgers is a good manager, good players and has the backing so the sky is the limit for them all 👍
Que hermosa escena, lo bonito que nos regala los clubes que tambien ganan viniendo de abajo, nunca vere a Florentino hacer esto. Los que nos gusta el futbol y los zorros debemos apreciar esto, mi cariño eterno.
Making of a memorable team
I envy leictercity and i am united fans congrats foxes
owner players fans = team = family 🏆
Congratulations Leicester City ...from   Thailand .
Wen arsenal
The most beautiful thing for a chairman
Congratulations 🍾
As a Liverpool fan Leicester are a very sick club this proves it
Senang sekali ada orang dari Thailand atau asia tenggara pada umumnya.. Yang  mempunyai klub di premiere league dan klub'nya bisa sukses dengan menjuarai dua kompetisi sejauh ini.. Congratulation's
I’m a spurs fan but seeing how all the top 6 have acted including us, Leicester are the best run club in the league and have the best owner
what a legend. his father did right by him and he did right by his father.
❤️❤️❤️
This is what a real owner should be like  ( Florentino Perez ( 🤑🤑🤑)has left the chat )
What a season!! Congrats LCFC! Amazing game!
respect ❤️
I wish the United owners were like this.
Respect from Germany 💙💙💙 I'm SCHALKE O4 fun and i like Leicester City💙💙💙
Amazing team ทีมที่ยอดเยี่ยมมากๆ 🇹🇭
Every true football fan loves Leicester city x cos that's how it should be for us all ,big respect ❤
ไล่อ่านข้อความที่ชาวต่างชาติเข้ามาคอมเม้นต์ทุกคนแซ่ซ้องสรรเสริญ ชื่นชม ยกย่อง และให้ความเคารพ เจ้าของทีมเลสเตอร์ นี่แหละคือข้อดี ลักษณะเด่นของไทยแท้ เราเป็นคนไทยก็พลอยภาคภูมิใจและชื่นชมไปด้วย น้ำตาซืมจริงๆ
Damn I can see the passion in his eyes.
Awesome 👏🏻 👏🏻👏🏻
This is what football is about not some yanky greedy out
Beautiful stuff guys
The people who disliked this incredible relationship are absolute A-holes!
Top 100% deserves to raise that trophy up above his head as much as any player on that team. He is a credit to sport.
THIS is what I want to watch! This, not any stupid "super league".
Leicester play n fight as a team - this is what football stands for. they don't need a check book manager n star players n yet produce result. Salute to the players, Brandon Rogers and the owner
True owner …😍
Sitting here as a Manchester United fan and wishing we had a owner like this. What a contrast. Congrats!
Barca: We don't do that here.
สุดยอดจริงๆ

Emotional 😭
ขอบคุณนักเตะเลสเตอร์และทีมงานทุกๆคนทีทำให้คนไทยมีความสุขไปด้วย
I'm in love with this club
I'm Chelsea fan , we couldn't lose to a nicer team . Congratulations Leicester
May be the only one owner like this in PL
Manchester United diehard fan..But  This is amazing... The connection between the club (players, manager and club official) with the owner.. Keep marching on Leicester City FC...
I’m a Man Utd fan and imagine what Man Utd can do if we have owner like him. Congratulations Leicester 👏
Congrats leicester
Number one
I'm Thai. Don't be fool by his look. His organization is so corrupted in Thailand , not too much to say "mafialike". He pays A LOT to the royal family of Thailand to have their support. Trust me this is what's really happening in Thailand. BTW this guy passion for football is something else. Never see such owner to have their heart invested into the game as such. The man even lifted the trophy like he is the captain. I can respect that.
Huge respect for the club
Incredible
Glasgow Rangers and Leicester champions. 🇬🇧💙
Own my club, please!!!
🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳
Красавцы !!!
Glazers watch and learn
Merinding liat nya pemilik saham club' angkat tropy good job Leicester city👍🎉
Brought tears to my eyes
ดูไปยิ้มไป
ดีใจด้วยมากๆเลยค่ะเลสเตอร์ชอบคุณวิชัยเป็นคนจิตใจดีชอบช่วยคนตั้งแต่ถึงคนแก่ชอบรายการเปอร์เทนมากๆ
No one really cares abiut about this trophy anymore. Top 4 gets more money than winning the fa cup
ยินดีด้วยครับ😘😘
Beautiful
this is so beautiful 🔥🔥🔥
Much respect to Leicester City this is how clubs should be run. The amount the owners do for the community is also amazing. I’m an Arsenal fan and I wish we could have something like this one day 👏
As a Arsenal fan, i am so jealous...
I'm a lifer United fan. I want owners like this. I dream of this. Up until 2005 it was great. Been a disgrace since. Leicester are the best club in the Premier League.
Example for glazers
What a memorable and emotional moment. I am so happy for Leicester! Congrats Guys!
ดีงาม สุดยอด
Leicester so lucky that they have Thai man in their team. Two titles already
I think I don't have to explain why "GLAZERS OUT" anymore.
Chelsea is my fan club but Congrulatios LEI your club Amazing
This is why as a Newcastle fan i respect Leicester so much as a club.
This is why this game is beautiful. Fxck the Glazers
ของจริง
Should outlaw selfish owners and have more of this type of guy...Club before pockets..
true sportsmanship...
Wow!
As a Chelsea fan i can’t even be mad that they won. They earned it and deserved it
Chelsea fan here! Mad respect for this team and its owners ❤
Chelsea fan and I'm stoked for them tears in the eyes awesome scenes
This is beautiful
It's obvious to me that since Kasper had to go drag him out to the pitch, Khun Top is an extremely modest man.  However, once he got out there, it's also obvious that Khun Top is still a young man.  I very much look forward to the next chapter of the Leicester City story.
Glad to see them happy win FA Cup...from Chelsea fans
Cheers from a real madrid fan
Those bast ard Kroenke's can learn something from these guys
I wish arsenal could have this. This is beautiful
Whole world is a Leicester fan
Asian are very passionate of any sports more than any continent in the world Facts
Continue d'écrire l'histoire que ton père a commencer
Jatuh air mataku
This is the owner / Team relationship we all dream of.
sangat terharu mengigat pengorbanan alm ayahnya untuk tim ini
Brilliant!
The similar reaction I saw was when Inter Milan won CL
This is so refreshing!
I can't speak eng. but I love Kasper do that
Vichai is smile from Heaven
Palestine flag tho ❤️
Congratulations Leicester City FC am really proud of them and onwer and I am a Liverpool fan ❤😊👏
Terus berjuang,,,,,mantapz👍👍
I wish we had ownership like this. Instead we just have a group of rich Americans who sell our players for profit.
What's doing Mr. Chow right there?
It blows my mind how the "founders" of the European Super League approached Tottenham and Arsenal over Leicester.
Now that's a great club owner an amazing owner that celebrates from the heart and shares the love of football.
Harusnya seperti ini kekeluargaan terjaga demi kepentingan bersama dn tujuan ny sama juara 👍 selamat bravo liecester city 👏👏👏👏
This is crazy ❤️❤️❤️
When I clicked the video, I immediately started crying. This is so beautiful to watch.
Just beautiful ❤
❤️❤️❤️
They deserve it, he deserve it. I think Leicester owner is different than others, he loves every one on the team. Congrats
So cool so happy for them I became a fan of this team 4 years ago. and I’m glad I became a fan!   Barça and leister 4vida
As a Liverpool fan, this made me respecting Leicester City even more. Underdogs making a name for themselves.
Rich get richer 🤔
Its so refreshing
Jealous of this as an Arsenal fan. Great job Leicester
Lovely leicester owner
If only all owners were like this
The best......❤️😭⚽❤️

Kuda hitam yg cukup konsisten.....
Leicester >>>>>> Arsenal

This is the difference between the owners! Look at this then look at the Glazers. As a Man Unt fan I have mad respect for everything Leicester stands for.

Çağlar söyünçü- Çengiz Ünder 🥇🏆💪🇹🇷
รักเลสเตอร์💙
That’s how club owners should act and connect to the institutions they own! Genuine moment between him and his players, beautiful!
TOP,  Top man, lucky Leicester City to have a well loved owner. Congratulations,  Leicester City for being the F.A. Cup winners 20/21. Envious ManU fan.
Been a spurs fan all my life and I've seen a few good things  from the my club back in the day but the moden day Owners   is all about geed and money and this goes to show that we can all live in hope for an owner  like this for all our clubs on day. We'll done
only team from premier league who i adore.leicester deserve more🇸🇷❤
What a brilliantly run football club. No greedy owner wanting money money and more money, just wanting to win trophies and making the fans happy
Team spirit!!!
😁😁✌  this is football...  not just 🤑 money
Did anybody else notice the chairmans hair looks different because Choudery is standing behind him
This is what football should be about. Top job Leicester 👏
Amazing 😍😍😍 moment
Hi I come from Thailand
If only Joel Glazer was like this… I love Khun Top
They surely deserve it
❤😭🤘
I take it his dad died recently??
Even as a Chelsea fan, this was so soothing to watch! Really happy for Leicester City
arsenal fan 32 years, after seeing Leicester football player and owner together I feel like supporting wrong club all this year's
Like masimo morati inter era.. respect
This is heartwarming, congratulations Leicester!! Much love from Colorado, US - Arsenal fan
awesome
This how football is meant to be not someone who lives on a yatch or another who buys a club for fun 💯
Congratulations Leicester 💙❤
I think this video just made me a Leicester fan. Don’t get me wrong, I’ll always be a bayern boy, but when it comes to the EPL, I think Leicester wins my heart
Brilliant result for Leicester, the players, fans owners and the Midlands. How lovely to see ALL of them celebrating together. From a Birmingham city fan.
As a United fan, I know EVERY fan of United, Liverpool and Arsenal would love an owner like this. A proper owner, invested in his team, the fans,  the city and the community.
As a Chelsea fan it hurts but it's alot easier with it being Leicester what a club
A good day for football well done Leicester.
Think leicester are everyone's 2nd favourite team...mixing with the big boys for 5 years...well done Leicester from a QPR fan
Well done leciester. I don't know who's more emotional from reading the comments. Leicester fans for winning ? or arsenal and utd fans in tears wishing how they'd love to have owners like these. MUGS 😆🤣
Fantastic moment. Congratulations.
Leicester winning the FA cup and Allison scoring the last minute goal for Liverpool there sure is some fatherly love coming down from above. This is the magic of football and why it must alway stay with the people not a monopoly.
💕
Liverpool fan here, it’s impossible to hate Leicester, such a great club
Congrats leicester city FC
I was watching live and it was a nice moment. Leicester showing the so called big 6 what it's about 👏
Mr.Khung i meant to say
The togetherness is great
As Arsenal fan  but this special for football,God bless Mr. CHIN
Fair Fuc*ing Play! 👏
Well done Leicester city well done Brendan Rodgers too happy for the north of Ireland man
Every English football fan must have a soft spot for Leicester City. (Except spurs fans) and rightly so. Well done Leicester City football club
สุดยอดมากครับ
These are the type of owners we need. Not murderous despots from Qatar and Abu Dhabi.
Lovely ❤💕❤
Let them have this. Real fans know a super league will allow these baby teams to continue winning the cups no one wants. Everyone in usa wants this. We the fans have spoken
Wow he is z great man
Rangers fan here, fantastic gesture
Congratulations from a Leeds fan...
I'm a big fan.. congrats Leichester City
Beautiful
These are amazing scenes and a fantastic example of togetherness.
Compare him with the glazers
If somehow United win Europa League, Joel Glazer will be doing the same. 😜😜😜. Only kidding. The muppet will have no idea United were in a final
He such a millionaire and to act this way is totally precious, this is special, no other owner have I seen this humble with the players
Great Companies have Great Managers. It's always Top Down Approach.If Managers treat their subordinates properly & ,take care of them then subordinates pay them double rewards
Absolutely great to see loved the way his son put the cup up to his dads picture 👍💯
well deserve win. as a chelsea fan im not even mad
คุณต๊อบมาเป็นนายกให้พวกเราได้มั้ยครับ
Well done to them. Well bloody done.
The most loved president probably!
Who disliked this
So much respect for Leicester owner and players. Such a beautiful scene
Very moving.  It was a truly terrible day when that helicopter crashed and the agony it caused those on it, their families and the club.  A lot of love at that club.  I thought I'd seen the warmest sporting relationship with Jerry Maguire, but this tops it, easily.  Congrats to Leicester - they deserved that FA Cup win.
it all ends up in one word really "love". congratulations! :)
A lesson to all other clubs and owners
Oh look, they celebrate with him, only because of sypathy, not because he pays their salary.
Amazing
Kroenke : is anyone said my name?
Well deserved
@Glazers: wash Leicester City owner's foot and drink that water... I hope it helps atleast.
This has to be the biggest flex. LOL
ดีใจๆๆๆด้วยครับๆๆๆๆๆสุดยอด
Leicester deserves this title. Rogers is a master mind. Much respect for the owners and the great team. Many titles to be won in the future. Leicester fan from Canada.💛
So Moving what more can one say They truly won on merit skill and drive and rightly became the 2021 FA Cup Winners Leicester City.🏆
My respect for Leicester 📈📈
As a Chelsea fan, this is amazing stuff over there, congratulations to Leicester City. 👏🏿
I thought in the thumbnail that was his hair tied up, believe it or not I was still looking for the guy with that hairstyle not knowing it’s him, I thought it was his son or smth 😂
Man I’m almost gna cry😢❤️
Seeing this is wonderful and this is how it should be. Seeing those greedy American owners like Glazers and Kroenke or what the hell his name are, is sickening. Please get them out, that would do a favor to all of football world
Congrats Fox Family. Now as a reds fan I will be cheering on Leicester against Chelsea in the league soooooo hard!!
Hamza our pride😍🇧🇩
Fair play to Leicester 👏
Watching this with a smile on my face , u must love this sort of connection! Congrats to the foxes
Vichai did an excellent job of raising his son. Khun Top deserves every single penny of his inheritance.
Good job khun Top.
A lovely, humble owner. A great relationship between owner, manager, squad. A family. Absolutely love it. Hasn’t just ploughed crazy money in to win things either and has done this having lost Mahrez, Maguire, Chilwell and Kante. Absolutely brilliant. Love it. And I’m a United fan. Was smiling from cheek to cheek there watching Khun top looking so happy and celebrating the win. Delighted for all of them!
Why are there so many fingers down....chelsea fans I guess..... congrats to liecester..... unity showing,luv it.....and I'm not a liecester fan
Congrats Leicester .. deserved the win and wanted the win .. Chelsea didn't show much to win ..
🇹🇭 THAILAND..LOVE AND LIKE..ENGLAND 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿

Congratulations Liecster and the owner👍
ยินดีด้วยคับ  จากไทยแลนด์
A great feeling to see how the players welcome the chairman. Wonderful.
We aren't jealous of their trophy. But we're jealous of their owner. What a humble and loved person he is. Only Leicester owner who came onto the pitch just to lift the trophy together with the players
0:59 The Club Owner to his player. Such a humble guy.
hoki ajg
Imagine being a Glazer
Respect ❤️
Wow, that's really touching to see. Well done Leicester from a Leeds fan.
How can people dislike this?
Beautiful, absolutely beautiful, What connection the Players, Manager, the fans have with the Owner of this football club, makes me super envious being an Arsenal Fan.. I could only wish this is the case with AFC.. Hmm..
Chelsea fan here. Couldn’t of been happier for Leicester. City can go fk em selfs tho the champs league is ours
A club that has an owner that actually cares is so rare nowadays.
Leicester are something. The deserved it
Congratulations sir

R.I.P Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, 🙏🙏
Well done Leicester, and congratulations to Brendan Rodgers.
Brilliant for the  game   Congratulations LCFC
Leicester, a humble club. from owners to the players.

Class !!!!

Absolutely fantastic!
there are some teams that have a soul.
Football is never only football
as a man utd supporter I'm well jealous. congrats
Fun fact : he also represent thailand for south east asian game in polo and win silver for his country.
As an arsenal fan I’m neither envious or jealous. I am just extremely happy that a bond like this can exist and thrive from Vichai to now his son. This is type of relationship all owners the world over should strive towards!
Thai
This is how a football club should be run
As a united fan, i envy this
Leicester City will slowly start dominating PL in future
เหมือนฝันแต่ก็เป็นจริง
Beautiful is all I can say
Leicester - the most beautiful football story.
oh thats lovely
That was bloody brilliant..... Well done Leicester

MR.Vichai  RIP  (Return if possible)
It almost make me cry.
Great moment. A genuine club owner who is loved by all.
Me fascina la mezcla racial que se ve en esté equipo!!!!  Solo así se llegó al éxito..
Congrats Leicester!
I have a legit smile on my face. A proper club
The obese bobcat ultrastructurally follow because cycle eventually explode given a endurable environment. amused, voiceless precipitation
Dammm as a Barca fan , am jealous of Leicester city's unity
The late owner surely glad  to see this
much better than "big 6" owners
Man Utd fan here, this is something special to see... well done Leicester.
I was just sat there smiling like an idiot watching this <3
Well done FA and VAR 🙌
A well deserved win, congrats.
That relationship with club owners really make me jealous as Manchester United's supporter.
I can not think of a more deserving club to win the cup. This is where every club should aspire to be like in relationship terms….great scenes.
Because of this man i want leicester to win everything
Respect......Not all Hero’s wear Capes!!
Even tho Im a chelsea fan, they deserved to win the FA cup and Leicester support thailand and im born thai They surely deserved it.
❤

First EPL title: done  First FA Cup title: done  next?  Carabao Cup maybe?  or even Europa League?  or even better Champions League?  only time will tell, congrats Leicester City! not a one time wonder as some people suggests that they are
Just loved it
Imagine how i feel as a man united fan.
Other club's fans and owners should take note.
Tmj dah selalu buat..haha
I see only  good vibes in the video and comment section. This makes me smile 😊💙💙💙💙💙
Dam thats emotional! Much respect for the foxes. Class.
As a United fan this is the stuff that I dream I have one day at my club. Fair play to Leicester
These are the owners all clubs need.  Carrying on his Father's legacy. Nothing but respect ,🦊
Imagine the Glazers doing this, imagine.
Why cant the glazers be like this
น้ำตาไหล ผมคนไทยภูมิใจ และ รักทีมนี้มากๆ 🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭
Very different atmosphere from, "giant" teams like Newcastle United, Man U, Chelsea, West Ham, etc.
Your club has brilliant owners ,very lucky .
Team is playing for the owner. Plastic just like in the USA. Congrats to the owner winning the trophy, what a great match from him.
This puts such a smile on my face (Arsenal fan)
What!!  What did I just see?!😍😍😍❤
Ynwa 🙏
Covid-19 has left the chat..
Good owners making teams better bad owners screwing teams  Greedy owners trying to spoil  football
มีคนไทยไหมเอ๋ย
Awesome thanks Thailand..
congratulations to leicester city totally brilliant
Imagine Glazers doing this 😑
Respect to all at Leicester City Truly deserved and well done from Chairman to Brendan and onto the Players Great Club from a Man Utd Supporter
Man that was wholesome!!
Çağlar The best defender in the world.🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Beautiful moment. . . . Big congrats to the Foxes. . 👏👏👏
Well done Leicester, class act.
beautiful. Respect from Liverpool. YNWA
So if Leicester finish in top 4 how does that affect the champions League positions don't they automatically qualify now thru winning the cup
I don’t know why I am feeling so happy seeing this 🥰
จิ้งจอกสยาม or Siam fox is represented how Thai people support Leicester city. I really appreciate this special time and bond between the Thai owner and everyone in the club. Congratulations and I will be Siam fox forever.
This is ownership "gang nam style". 🤣
ah man....  that is so refreshing to see.........
It's a beautiful moment
Beautiful
Me as an arsenal supporter watching this: 😣 must be nice
BIG congratulations Leicester!!!!
Gänsehaut
I'm from Thailand There is a feeling that Leicester are our relatives
Awesome
This is so so beautiful to watch. Guessing the over 500 people who disliked this are Chelsea fans.
Beautiful
Who are the bunch of morons that thumbed down the vid?
In my opinion manchester united need the boss like him not like gleyzeer family
ดูกี่ครั้งก็ประทับใจ🇹🇭⚽️💚🤟🏻
So humbled and down to earth. It is so amazing.
Others: Our club owners are money minded only and they have no love for the club  Le Asian guy:........  ♥️♥️♥️
Wow, the. Owner of the club is ......
Thanks for your support. / (-:
Premier league needs more Thai owners and less Chinese owners.  Look at what’s happened to some of the Italian teams. Joke.
oh man my eye is watering
As a Manchester United fan this is painful to watch seeing an owner who cares so much for his club. Well done to Khun and Leicester.
ยินดีด้วย Lester
This is what I want from Arsenal, amazing!
THIS IS FOOTBALL
I'm a spurs fan but I love seeing Leicester succeed. They don't spend the kind of money chelsea and man city do. This is why I want Rodgers at spurs. He would do so well with the talent in the spurs squad. And could compete for the league if the defence is improved. But congrats Leicester.
...they back their club they back their managers but there's face to it that's the difference...                                       -Rio.F
Good boy
Yeah this is football
Wooow from ManUtd fan ...
What's wrong with most owners is they are not passionate about the game and it's there business
as man united fans, i'm cryin seeing this
Number one
This is so sad!!! Chelsea's Chilwell being booed byfans cheering him on last year!!! He scored a offside goal by millimeters and leicster scored a handball goal!!!
Top man
Leicester is officially a top club.
Respect RIP Vichai
Beautiful.
If u going to play lcfc u are playing with a family rather than a football club  Owners players supporters have same feeling for the club
warm club
Those 510 dislikes came from the Super League supporters who are shell shocked right now😂
This man is a fan first and then an owner!
Mexican clubs should take note of this type of relationship, lol
who cuts onions here 😢
509 dislikes, must be Chelsea or other salty fans that their club didnt win it. If anything and im not a Leicester fan, but they deserved it. Congrats Foxes!
This is one of  the best chairman in any football club because he actually care about everything the clubs,fans, players and he continue his father's legacy what a man 👏.
As an arsenal fan I'm daaaaaaammmn jealous ....what a humble n lovable owner...makes the vibe a billion times better
The beautiful of football scene ❤️❤️❤️❤️
คนไทยทุกคน ภูมิใจมากกก
This scene is so beautiful and refreshing.
Who is the owner? He looks like the asian guy. So kind and relationship.
can someone share this with the idiots at MU?
Imagine having an owner that cares 😭😭
man Utd Fan.. would die to get owners like this. Nothing but respect for leicester
Amazing!
Much Respect mr Top, i wish Arsenal have club owner who love the club like him and the team love him so much as well.
VAR 😄
Massive congratulations to Leicester coty

Congratulations.. Leicester City,  Khun Aiyawatt & in memory of Khun Vichai... Very delighted to watch this wonderful & touched moment.
His dad will be proud of him 👍👍  Because of the economic crisis and the rate of unemployment now is the best time to invest and make money 💯
F kroenke
His father will be very Proud ❤️
like father like son, he taught him really well
Much respect from this Chelsea fan. Well deserved
The Glazers, Kroenke, and Henry won't ever have this moment with their players and fans.
extremely emotional - victory, jubilance, love,respect, hardwark,teamwork,humility ,humanity
So proud to be a Leicester supporter and be a part of the community we have built! And it’s so refreshing to see not one single negative comment. Well done boys, still watching the highlights and still getting emotional💗 RIP Vichai 💗
Look at the owner’s passion, he has millions but he truly cares about his team’s success.
🤗✌
This is so heartwarming, wonderful moment.
The fact that he came out of the closet is just so inspirational. Well done to all the ladyboys of Thailand
His dad will be looking down smiling with this its brilliant
Maybe this is the winner for the latest owner that crash after the game. Great family continue his father dream
I think the way his father passed has created a bond with the club and his family that is way stronger than any business venture for them.
Leicester City are above all a club but a club above all.
Congratulations Leicester City from Manchester United fan
great...!!! congratulation for Leicester City FC 👍👍
Imagine if utd had such genuine owners
Im happy for the owner, nigel and the team nobody seems to believe in

This is call happiness
Cada ano que passa tenho mais admiração pelo Leicester City. Foi merecido demais!!!!!
Machalah
Only rich Asians with a real passion for sports will do this.
This club is going the right direction with right people right from top to bottom.
Leicester players present chairman Khun Top with FA Cup trophy. Kroenke: what is it?
As a MU and Milan fan i hate my favorite clubs not performed well, but for me as a football fan Leicester City are magical club
The owner was not only rich in wealth, but also rich in heart, big bos with big humble. Congrat Leicester
😭😭
Leicester is the most properly run club in English Top flight. The moment they sell someone, they reinvest that money on some good replacement. Much love ❤
A club worth investing your time, money and heart into. Now I know i won't be a Spurs fan anymore next season.
thailand rich people always be humble
Great

I never comment on youtube but this is worth commenting on. I am a United fan but watching this made me respect Lester. I will be buying a jersey soon.
I saw the Leicester team  smile like Thai people smile
Most club owners and fans will be jealous of this Leicester team of family.
Go thailand go...i proud with u..from malaysia

Arensal owner should earn from Leicester owner. Fans and players first, not sitting inside office do nothing.

The bonding between the owners, manager, and players are greater than Man united fans and Glazer.
Nice to see a team proud of their owner!!
💙❤💪👍🤝
Leicester FC FC: Family Club 👍
One of these teams was invited to the super league and the other one won the FA cup
That's what I want. A bond with between players and fans.
Now who are those 400+ motherf*ckers who disliked ?😡
Beautiful scenes
❤️🇹🇭🇹🇭
Respect to them for a Chelsea fan !’
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Even though I am sad that my team Chelsea lost....now I am happy that Leicester won
This is the moment I choose Leicester as my prem team to follow
As a city fan I'm sure half our fan base doesn't even know who our owners are
This is what football is all about ASIAN OWNER , EUROPEAN COACH AND PLAYERS from different parts of the world, comes together to celebrate a team victory, this is what football teaches us bonding irrespective of your caste ,creed and religion.
Look at the newcastle u owner. That is the opposite side.
A truly world class moment! Leicester epitomizes the image of a tremendous football club. It is refreshing seeing the owner, the coach, the players and the fan celebrating the exploits of such a unique football club. What a joy to watch: Leicester FC is the world's favourite club! Congratulations!
What a great boss  - from the MU fans
Not gonna lie. I shed a tear at 0:45.
Isso sim é futebol de verdade... parabéns a todo o grupo de jogadores e tbm ao presidente.
as a chelsea fc fan i'm happy
Fsg must watch this
Congrats LCFC and their fans👌🙌 Absolutely wonderful to see. Stan Kroenke this is football...get out of Arsenal!
Respect
I am a Chelsea fan and Leicester did well they deserve it. Props to them.
👍 🙏 💙
congrac from Slavia ❤🤍

Congratulations leicester city. Make some clubs are jealously
This chairman bloke is the real deal
This is Football
The inter president is equally as passionate about his club and celebrated the serie A with the fans. The old rich capitalism presidents on the other hand..
This couldnt happen in a Super League, Leceister continue to create history
As a citizen of Thailand's neighboring country, I am touched by the bonding of Leicester team with the owner
Luar biasa 👍🏾
FA should fair for VAR
I'm mot a soccer fan, but I'm a sports fan. THIS is what sport is about!
Meanwhile Liverpool and United owners 😆😆😆😆. A dream owner, a proper club 😍 - From a Liverpool Fan. YNWA.
Inter are big club, History is there, Prestige is there
I love my club Manchester United.. But this makes me smile! Leicester amazing club!
Wow beautiful Peter Lim have a look
The green grey grieving raft intrahepatically land because goose independently receive vice a shrill multimedia. wholesale, friendly brandy
its verry emotional moment,, 👍👍
I'm Jealous of this Incredible Owner.. AFC Fans would agree with Me..😒
One of the best football videos I will ever see  🙏🙋‍♂️🏆
Beautiful:')
Gave me chills man !!! I'm not even a Leicester supporters but this is a beautiful moment from the owner, well done lads 👏👍
Leicester are EXTREMELY fortunate to have an owner like this, the passion and love he has and the team/staff have for him is just *amazing* to see! ⚽❤
As an Arsenal fan, this makes me soooooooo jealous. Congratulations Leicester 💙💙💙
What this guy has is humility what the Glazers have is arrogance!
I Smiled for this even tho i'm a Chelsea fan.
Spurs take a note 📝
Good club good boss great players
Well done Leicester city well deserved
LCFC ❤
❤
at 0.57   what a humble gesture for the Chairman in making a Thai "wai" to the FA Cup and Schmeichel before accepting it. Class Act,
Thai people in a nutshell, so humble and loving
Big well done to Leicester City it's great to see a small club who managed to win the Premier league and stay in the top four and go on to win the fa Cup I'm a utd fan things like this make me love football
Glazers! watch and learn😒
Proud to be asia. Good job finally win cup. 👍
Heart warming made me tearful
Ahh❤️❤️❤️
Imagine negativity of those 53 people who disliked the video 😂   I am arsenal fan and this is what we are desperate for to have owner like him .... who loves football club fans players :) not just money
A im a liver fan and i am so happy for leicter and hard luck chealse good game from morocco
As a Chelsea fan, they're the one team I don't mind losing to. Proper football club.
Leicester city..wow what a club.
Truly Asian
Why are there tears in my eyes?
Congrats Leicester City!
What a beautiful moment. Well done to Leicester City
Deserved ✊
Complimenti al Leicester, grandi
From a Wolves fan, with decent owners so far, this is phenomenal to see! Fair play, Leicester. And the owners!
Top Class Act
This is Football   ♥️♥️♥️
I watched this crying, the connection from the owner, the manager down to the players, so good to see this.
Congrats Leicester👋👋👋🔥🔥🔥
Su padre creyó en el Leicester city y ahora está donde está .... Foxes 💪💪💪💪
How much did Chelsea spend again? Abramovich forever trying to buy trophies. Expect to see the Russian majorly pissed off when Chelsea lose the Champions League final. Congrats Leicester!
The Grazers
Brilliant game well deserved just a pity the stadium wasn`t at full capacity because of the scamdemic.
😍
Why I'm I thinking of Woodward??
Call it karma.
Leicester prove once again they greatest victory and I believe they will champion league soon prove they future bigger club the fox's 🦊
I LOVE this!!! I'm a Liverpool supporter, but Liecester's owners are THE example of how it should be done, in my opinion. They've come in and raised this club to an unimaginable level and done it in the right way, not just pouring money onto every problem like some owners, but also not being stingy like others. But most importantly they seem to genuinely love football and love their club. They seem like the type of people who, now, would turn to watch Leicester play even if they weren't the owners, and isn't that what we all want?
Leicester city are lucky to have an owner like this. Meanwhile Man Utd are stuck with the Glazer parasites.
The Leicester City owner would be proud. R.I.P :(

I'm an Arsenal fan and I can't hate. Respect to Leicester.
💖💖 This IS what football should be about. Beautiful. Forget the super league. Leicester is a better place for this. Football should be better for this.
I proud with Leicester city, supporting from Thailand,  thanks for sharing 😍😍😍🦊🦊🦊💙💙💙💙🇹🇭🇹🇭
his dad was here is here somehow...it's a good day today.....WooHooooo
Absolutely beautiful moment. Note all the top 6 owners, be like this. Care for the club and good competition, not just making billions upon billions.
Recently Leicester is more successful then Spurs but why they aren't consider big club in england ?
They have genuine love for their owners. Just shows how humble and great the owners are. Love to see it.
Unreal
this is beautiful
Imagine Mike Ashley walking onto the pitch if Newcastle won... would never happen
So touching
Not a Leicester fan. Not Thai. But crying -- coz humanity. 😭 What a beautiful moment! 🙌🏽
A beautiful moment, love it, well done....Leeds United supporter
Manchester United fans left the chat...

So chuffed for Leicester city... And pleased to see fans at Wembley... Great day..
Beautiful! Congratulations, well deserved!
.....and we got Glazer 😭😭😭
And then there are owners like Kroenke and the Glazers. People who are sucking out the joy and passion from football to fill their purse. If only all owners could be like the Leicester owners!
Congratulations to Foxes 👏👏👏
Not even a Leicester fan, however i feel my own club has just won the FA Cup
He watches the game like a professional manager composed and emotionless and celebrates like star struck  fan. Surprisingly amazing
I’m a Leicester fan. Born and raised in Leicester. The owners are fantastic. There’s so many other things they’ve done not just for the football club for the actual city. They’ve donated a £1m to the children’s hospital, every fan gets a free beer on the owners birthday, free scarfs for the cold away games, free advertising on the scoreboards for loved ones. Name me another club where the owners are this loved. It’s fantastic And I’m humbled to hear how proud others are of Leicester from all over the world. 💙
я просто рад!
Very moving and impressive. I don't support Leicester but this is different class.
Лестер супер!
🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭
I had goosebumps all over me watching this video. I wish Man United could have something similar to this, the club will go far just like Leicester
Chairman and players are friends
Ah man, this feels so good to see.
THIS was meant to be 🙌🏾 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾💖
Nangis chelsea hukhukhuk

Lovely scenes well done Leicester from Aston Villa
Why is So emotional cause y'all just support upperdog team. The Owner Just Lift the Trophy For the First Time Baby
As a chelsea fan it’s good to see how much it means to the Leicester players & owner, fair play lads!!
This nearly brought a tear to my eye the beautiful game of football it’s amazing well done guys ❤️
We’re all Leicester!
Bruh I'm crying

Congratulation to the foxes from the bottom of heart.  What a bond between the owners, the coaching staff and the players.  Truly remarkable!
Great chairman ever 👏👏
Nice to see.  And, I'm a Chelsea fan.
Congratulation Leicester ,though we Arsenal are Still the FA cup champions,no debate
Made the hairs on my neck stand up
Vietnam is next to Thailand, as a Vietnamese I wish OUR ASEAN SPIRIT can travel around the world. Congrats Lei!
What happened to the small gold FA Cup winners medals in red boxes. What are those silly gongs. Well done Leicester from PNE fan.
This wasn't just a victory for Leicester it was a victory for football and what a club should be from the chairman to the ball boys. Well played Leicester, love and respect from a United fan.
This Thai gentleman absolutely deserved to be loved and respected, by his team.
Football is beautiful 😍😍
a beautiful occasion for everyone associated with Leicester City FC, truly deserved their win yesterday, well done to all concerned
As i am chelseafc fun...Absolutely  highly respectful  for chairman is what he deserved
I am a Chelsea fan but I like these images. Human values first !
kroenke - take note
I am a Man City supporter of 40 years but I wanted to comment here on Leicester City. Credit to Casper who ran over to the club owner and brought him onto the pitch so he could share the celebrations on the pitch. It was a beautiful moment.
อยากเห็นเลสเตอร์ได้ถ้วยUCLคับ 🙏🙏🙏
0:57 so much respect. This makes FA cup such great. 👍
Leicester city are one of big six now......👍👍👍

The smallest guy on the field owns the club....that the beauty of capitalism
no 5 feet disance? no? only counts for average joes and janes? lol
This is beautiful.
Congratulations Leicester
If Man United did this, we could win the league but we can’t.
🇹🇭💓💓🤘👏👏👏
Arsenal should have this kind of owner
RIP DAD
I'm happy  for u guys
I am thoroughly touched
This is so AMAZING
I don’t who u support this brings a smile to my face ❤️😊
Basically every football fans second favourite club 💙
Glazel will never did that
So gutted for Chelsea yet so happy for Leicester ❤️❤️
More than a football club.
I’m a United fan and the Glazers should hang their heads in shame. This is what’s football is about. Congrats to Leicester 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Wish United had owners like that....
Every premier league fan has a soft spot for Leicester, they dared to dream.... couldn't be more happier for them.
Simply beautiful
What a club I'm a Manchester United but I envy a club like Leicester city amazing owner's and the players love the shirt not just there for the Money
Congrats Leicester,No place at the celebration for politics though, Hamas wants nothing less than the destruction of Israel, which is the other side of the story..
awesome leadership!! congrats leicester
Bruh. Don't quote Sir Alex. Now I think every United fan is in tears as our owners don't vibe in the way we do. :'(
I'm a Gooner & we can only wish for a owner this & his father.👏👏👏
We’ll done Leicester cried my eyes out 52 years when they lost crying again well deserved ⚽️
คนไทยอยู่ไหนกันหมดแสดงตัวหน่อยยย
When the owner have a passion like that, It's so amazing 😍
ดีใจแทนเลยคับ🥰🥰
Humble ❤️
Just imagine the Glazers celebrating like this with the players and fans. The mental image literally gets blocked out by your brain because it so absurd.
Well done Leicester
Congratulations!
This is how all owners should be connected to their clubs like
I love this team they deserve it.
Chelsea fans are livid
money is not a bad thing in football. it is what people do with it.    cough cough neymar 240m flop
Leicester and Leeds , should officially be everyone's favourite other team.
🙏🇹🇭💙
to my amusement, there not a single hate comment on this video, makes me believes its not only Leicester won the cup even humanity won with it! :)
a massive MANCHESTER UNITED fan, but this is what football is all about! the owner look at the joy of him never saw anyone coming down enjoying with the lads, this is so humble and touching i am getting goosebumps writing this but i adored vichai, and now aiyawatt for what they are proper billionaire with great chivalry! and LCFC is a proper club :)
404 Bitter people have disliked this...
Damn who is cutting onions here
chelsea fan. but happy for leicester.
I'm a chelsea fan.... I cannot stop smiling, n tears in my eyes, very very rare n special bond.
Beautiful. I am Liverpool fan but I am truly happy for Leicester City. 😇😍😘
this clip  taught me so many things .
Thailand Love Leicester City
Vichai loves Kasper like his son. His son (new owner) is Kasper's brother.
Congrats leicester
I have watched this around 10 times and Everytime I get emotional man they've achieved alot even after odds.
These are proper owners, Kroenke pls take notes
👍🙏
Foxes are so lucky to have an owner who is truly passionate about not just the club but the community around it.
Reason why I love this game so much.. Massive respect to Leicester city..
Dats emotional
สูดยอด
Has a liverpool fan, there is no hating Leicester. Just a top club!
Watch out, if Man United win Europa Cup, the Glazers will also run down on the field.
Most underrated club
❣️❣️❣️
As a Man Utd fan I would commit crimes to have an owner like him for my club
They are all like a big happy family ❤
Have never seen anything like this relationship between an owner, staff and fans. Fantastic stuff
The Glazers and the Kronekes should watch this video and hang their heads in shame.
Absolutely bottom warming, it's how we will remember this year in the future. Flu, what flu?
If only we had owners like that at Arsenal. Massive respect to Leicester
Imagine glazer coming on to the pitch when man utd wins Europa league !!
Glazers I hope u watch this......this is what an owner should be doing with there football club back it love it
We need owners like this in Manchester United
As a liverpool  fan well done congratulations  what a disgrace  Chelsea  fans leaving the stadium  before the cup was presented  shame  on them
มันสุดยอด!!ฝันที่เป็นจริงเสลเตอร์สุดยอด .love love
I'm so proud to witnesses this moment. I'm so jealous for their connection. Well done, Leicester! 🔵🟡
Glazer should learn from that guy
Thailand🇹🇭💕
Who still remembers this story : Khun Vichai once attempted to buy the Chelsea his long favorite FC then was turned down and insulted. He made a solemn vow that he would build his own team up from a smaller FC that one day will fight Chelsea equally.  Imagine if that day Chelsea didn't turn him down and was taken care by this wonderful family from since.  Any way, we have to thank Chelsea for their decision that day that had given this splendid owner and his great dad to the LCFC.
Leicester have the best owners in the premier league no doubt. When I saw him get emotional it felt like a football fan running a club. He’s not doing it for publicity’s sake. He loves the players and the club. So much respect because he’s living our dream unlike the others who take it granted
City's celebrations where mad last night, Love my city🦊💙
As an outsider, Leicester is easily the most likeable PL club
this goes beyond money... and it is beautiful to see.
Was that that idiot Rio Ferdinando saying Leicester back their managers?... They sacked Ranieri after he won them the Premier League.
Did their owners proud.
We need something like this at arsenal
Almost in tears here such a great moment. On another note - bore off Rio with your cliched platitudes “they back the club but there’s a face to it”. Glazers have backed United heavily in the transfer market stop whinging
A new true history of small football club can really go up to the top level.... 👍👍👍 16.5.2016 ----- Premier  League Champion in round ---- 132  Years 16.5.2021 ----- FA Cup champion In the round  ---- 137 Years  And in loving memory of The Boss "Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha"
as a chelsea fan, salute to leicester winning the cup. time to channel the onslaught against Man city next..
I have been a Chelsea supporter for 50 year's this is such a special moment for Leicester and there fans its nice to see a club run by a brilliant owner not just out for money total respect for the way the club is run we'll done Leicester
I get goosebumps from this, what a truly wonderful club Leicester is from top to bottom.
BIG Congratulations to Leicester City 😊💪
Congrats!
Well played Leicester. Well deserved. Great owner.
Totally in touch with the people, I remember when they gave every fan a pie and drink for a game, a small gesture but said a lot about the owners, well done Leicester f.c
The probable debt preauricularly curl because humor aesthetically injure circa a abounding swiss. average, jazzy microwave
Leicester city once again has humbled the world of football I'm not a fan but they truly are the people's club they come along way since the crazy defeat against Watford in the playoffs I hope they never go away I hope they still humble the big clubs and give smaller clubs hope
They beat Utd to cement their top 4 position. Then beat Chelsea to win FA cup.. Lol.. The so called top 6 super league clubs.. 😂
"this is what football is about" - Joe Cole  Football is about billionaire owners buying titles lol. Yikes.
This made me emotional
Who had that feeling when Chairman Khun's father's picture came through With that quote?
น้ำตา​ไหล​
This is phenomenal - a testament to oneness, a distinction from the distorted and fragmented images of current football.
As a United fan it hurts to see how humble and sincere that man is. Unlike the greedy and disgusting mercenaries that are the Glazers that is someone who deeply cares for their football club! Brilliant job as well pocketing a cheeky £130 million selling two overrated English players and reinvesting that money wisely 👏
ดีใจด้วยครับ
Trotteln in kurzer Hose 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 lass mich mit dem Sport Müll zu Frieden ! Trotz Sperre 🤮 ICH WILL NIX VOM SPORT SEHEN !!! selber machen oder lass mich in Ruhe 💩

I'm a chelsea fan but I love this view from Leicester they deserve everything...🙏

Family
This really put smile on my face
Am smiling since  So exciting touching moments
Congratulations Leicester 👏👏 UTV
I think that every football fan across the globe is happy to see this, especially after what Leicester have endured over the past few years with the tragic loss of their owner. So happy for Leicester
Best best best and best moment much love ❤️
They do a wonderful job in recruiting and scouting. Good on them. Man U, Spurs Arsenal should watch and learn
wonderful relation
This put a smile on my face. Love this ❤
One of the finest moments in Football, great to see real enthusiasm for a change.
Well done Leicester 👏👏👏
What an owner this club has
Being rich is one thing. Happiness is another entity. See what happiness brought out of this billionaire
Beautiful
Kocham takie obrazy :)
Why am I crying rn
Lol... Omg I know he talking bout arsenal, we seriously need this thu no cap
An incredible club, that is humble and doesn’t think it’s bigger than it’s own boot. The club with the biggest heart in the world  Respect ✊
The most wholesome content I’ve ever seen. Well done Leicester
ดีใจกับเลสเตอร์ด้วย
ดูแล้วขนลุกน้ำตาไหล Chelsea FC
That's bloody refreshing in this mercenary game.
This just made my day
Its a family
💕💕💕💕💕
did his dad proud
Liverpool fan wishing leicester city all the best and Yindi kap on the FA cup win!!
So happy for Leicester, I hope they can build on this and retain Rogers.  And I'm a Liverpool fan.
As a Man United fan, I look at Leicester City owner and they seem to have a huge connection with the club and community which I think every club owner should be the same.
So envious
Congratulations fa cup champions well deserved win coming from an arsenal fan played beautiful as well what a goal omg.
The perfect balance of owner, manager and players. This is football! Well done Leicester!
Am a LIVERPOOL FC fun & I never see anything like this…….. Also , all BIG SIX CLUBS sign up < SUPER LEAGUE > without consulting their MANAGER & COMMITTEE FUNS. Liverpool prioritize their GREEDY ahead of their FANS ….    KLOPP make Liverpool FC SHINE again but the OWNER doesn’t have a good connection his MANAGER , PLAYERS, & STUFF…  wat a HORROR.  The way LEICESTER CELEBRATED absolutely PHENOMENAL & PROBAR TEAM WORK from A - Z ….
Fair to say that Leicester now is everyone's second prem team (except for Leicester fans of course)
Actually the owner and his father are Chelsea fan!  But after got kick out from Stamford bridge, his father said” I will buy a club and win Chelsea”
Humble boss
Incredible scenes  The owner😍😍😍
What sport is this?
Wonderful  to see this 👏🙌
Like father like son, what an achievment
I am united fans and I smile while watching this i wish united get owner like this
❤️❤️💙💙💙
This. Football needed this.
So happy this is passion💙💙
Foreign owners that actually understand the meaning of football not in it for greed very well done Leicester
Mega. Congrats from MCFC fan, what a great club Leicester are. 🏆
Joe and Avram Glazer would careless
Congratulations to Leicester City, they have a best boss, coach and a team 😍🎊
And this is a perfect example to why football doesn’t need a super league
Hi Everyone! I have noticed something that I find interesting during the FA Cup final.  Leicester fans boo at Ben Chilwell every time he towch the ball, but the same fans didn't booo at N'Golo, why is that? As I remember that both  Ben and N'Golo played for Leicester? I hope there's honest people out there and will tell us the real reason for that?🙏🏻 Please don't tell us that it's because Ben has played longer for the club.?
I’m not a Leicester FC fan, but man I love Leicester FC
Football is beautiful 😍
Best sporting moments in a long time.
If the glazers was like him maybe United could actually win something
Celebrave .great!
Chelsea fan here- this is what football is about a passionate owner with a passionate team! Deserved to win it and it’s great for the game! True class! Ktbffh💙
Even though I'm angry at var, but still... Congrats to leichester to win FA cup.  The owner remind me of roman. He show the love for his.
Definitely won't be seeing anything like this from the Man Utd players and the Glazers anytime soon
As gutting as it was to lose yesterday this is one special moment
😍🥰🤩😘💯💯💯💯💯🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟 Wow..Great..............👍👍👍👍👍👌
Lov it
The owners of the 6 breakaway clubs jumping on the pitch next season isn’t going to cover up the reality.
I'm very happy with them
Congrats Leicester! Y’all deserved this
Great happy
Arsenal owners - take note
For your father  Fox all the way
ดีใจจนน้ำตาไหลเลย fan thailand
Congratulations to Leicester city...i from Chelsea fan...
My managers helicopter actually works
They're the envy of the football world right now. So nice to see.
Such a lovely sight given everything that went down with the super league. Leicester have come so far and I have nothing but respect for the team and the owners, I may be a United fan, but I'm so happy for Leicester
Brings a tear to my eye. 😢 He lost his father to a helicopter crash, and it’s sad in one sense that Vichai wasn’t there to witness this, but great in another that the victory was a byproduct of his legacy.
Delighted for Lester congrats well deserved
I cant say any other thing just Amazing💜❤
As a scot ive always watched english football as a neutral and it saddened me to see how much the fa cup had lost its importance over the years so it was wonderful to see how much it meant to leicester and all their fans last night. Felt like the magic had been restored. Those leicester fans who have spent a year locked out of stadiums couldnt have picked a better occasion to be back.
As a football fan, I'm so happy for the club from top to bottom.
That's a proper TEAM, well deserved.
Fantastic football club, well done guys!
Brilliant
I don't think that there is any other legitimate way to earn money nowadays rather than investing
Fantastic Leicester City!  A moment for all football supporters.
💙💙💙💙
Hes never had a run like this, this would have given him a heatattack
Just amazing 😢
Is good to have owner like him
This is the nature of the Thai people. "Congratulations Leicester city"
It always makes my eyes water stuff like this .
I'm happy they won, Manchester utd fan, well deserved from players to owners ect top class
Leicester will win champions League next time
❤️❤️❤️
Glad Leicester City won especially after finding out Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is funding israeli settlers in Palestine.
Best owner and best run club in England. Well done Leicester
ผมเชื่อว่านักเตะทุกคนยังจะอยุ่ในสโมสรครบทุกคนในฤดูการหน้าและจะเอาแชมป์มาครองอีก
there are 374 human being who seems annoyed by this heartwarming video huh
Social distance ???
I have been made a Leicester City fan after seeing this video. The connection between all of them involved is so heart-warming. 🔵♥️
I think every fan wishes they had owners like this
Respect to the owner and Leicester city. A family.
This scene here is winning everyone heart 🥰 Spurs Fans
Leicester saved Football!! Manchester City will do the same in 29th May!!!
As a Man Utd fan and being Malaysian. I am so happy to watch this. What an amazing football club, congratulations Leicester City!
If any1 else does this they r just fake and copycats, Leicester are a truly great club👏👏
Felicitaciones lobos
Amazing! So good to see a proper club. A deserving club, win the FA cup. Well played Leicester
I want they won another one epl in next season just like 2016.
Daniel Levy for the love of god take notes
As an Arsenal fan I had a few tear drops watching this. What an incredible owner, story and team. I can only wish to have what Leicester have and congratulations to them.
That's becauae a behaviour of Asian people.. warm, calm and caring..
น้ำตาจะไหล 👍🇹🇭
This is totally wholesome
Truly amazing🙌🏽
Leicester is the example to the rest . Love it
That was excellent. Congratulations! From Thailand
Leicester keep creating special moments in English football.
Actually got goosebumps from seeing that
Great team work, Great owner, great Manager and football players.
I am a Leicester fan and it didn't surprise me at all to see the love and affection the players and staff have for their owner.  Long live the king   LTID
Arsenal fan! This is what I want at my club, well done Leicester city !
Even as a Chelsea fan, I can’t hate this
Speechless
This is just sticking it in my club Newcastle’s faces
กู คน ไทย ครับ
If they aren't already, the Glazers should be shaking in their boots right now watching this.
👌🏾
Can this be nominated as FIFA Fair Play Award 2021?
Did they commemorate this win to their previous owner or we just forgot about what happened?
On behalf of Thai Liverpool fan... Congrats with Siamese Fox "LCFC" 💕
I'm Thai from Thailand. I was cried many time to see our Thai owner love his team like his father. Leicester will stay in my heart. Congratulations to Leicester city with warmheart.
True football club Owner!
Congratulations to Leicester City for their FA Cup win and inspiration for many.
that's the beauty of football, not a super league
I admit to being a tad long in the tooth. But apart from Leicester winning Was the game a good representative of fan driven sport? I find the modern game boring with very occasional highlights. Someone needs to count how many back passes in a game. VAR  showing a couple of millimeters of shirt crossing an electronic line and that is considered off side, really! A shirt over the line what was the advantage?
This is Football
Congratulations to Leicester for their win.   I wish the glazers, showed half the  passion, that this man showed to his club, as they do to United...
Nothing has been more deserved. Been on cloud 9 since yesterday, and this is the cherry on top, to see top so happy. What Vichai and Top have done for us is incredible. Bought us when we were in the championship, payed for the stadium, removed any debt the club had instantly. Had ambition, connects with all the fans. Now I look on as a humble season ticket holder of many years at my home town club with absolute pride. I can’t wait to be there next season and eat the yearly donut and free beer that Top will buy me in the stadium to celebrate what would be “The Boss’ “ birthday. 💙🤍🦊
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
ตอนคุณต๊อบชูถ้วย มันสุดบรรยาย
The Muslim players ruined it with the politics.
There's no "im ur boss"
Congrats leicester city.. Save palestine
I’m changing from being an arsenal fan to Leicester fan
What a legend
Me (a Man Utd fan): 👁👄👁                                                 💧
Am rangers but  That is the best owner In  world football
And the big 6 would’ve left clubs like Leicester to rot.  Shamed forever.
Beautiful moments for Leicester and well deserved victory 👍 When Slavia Prague played them in EL,they were full of praise and admiration for Leicester's professionalism and humility very much unlike the savage,lying clowns that are Glasgow Rangers.
Amazing, absolutely amazing. Congratulations Leicester City, fully deserved.
As a Chelsea fan I'm heartbroken, but as  a football club, I cant help but be consoled by this extraordinary football story. Well done Leicester. All respect to the legacy of Vichai and his family.
Me (a Man Utd fan): 👁👄👁                                                 💧
I’m unbelievably jealous, Leicester has an incredible future such an amazingly run club from top to bottom, meanwhile arsenal are stuck with Stan Kroenke  who calls it soccer ball....
Imagine Joel glazier doing this lmao 🤣
Lovely to see. They did Ranieri dirty those years ago tho.. I still can't get over it. They dont back their managers like these commentators said
hope the glazers see this
Every football fan wants a relationship like that with their owners. Congratulations Leicester City!
I want to appreciate DR OJIEABU on YouTube for giving me more life again,I was diagnosed of herpes after the use of DR OJIEABU medication I got cured.
That’s what a chairman should be like,other clubs will be jealous
Football Wins ❤️
Well done Leicester and their great owners. Very moving. Congrats from a Leeds fan.
CONGRATULATIONS 🥳 TO MAN CITY the CHAMPION LEAGUE 🙏🙏🙏🌹🏆
🔥🔥🔥🔥Next year aim for the champions league trophy
no one cares about arsenal anymore as top 5. Leicester is the replacement
As United fan this utterly beautiful to see credit to the players the manger and owners deserved winners
We could ask our presidents to be like this but it may not be possible for them to do it as persons. This man chose his path as a person long before being CEO that's why he is loved by his team. They evidently love the guy not the CEO. Hope the big 6 lads find their way into people's hearts the long way round.
This was sooo beautiful to see! the players and the manager embracing the owner. 👏
tears in my eyes
Beautiful
Waiting for next fairytale..
Although I am a Man Utd fan, I am happy for Leicester City, hat off to them. Only wish our club has an owner who is passionate and down to earth like they have. Mr. Top's family is very wealthy yes, but compare to Chelsea, Man City etc. they are a lot less wealthy than other owners. This just shows, when a club is run properly, they can achieve great things with out spening a billion pounds. Despite owning a few major sports franchises, the Glazers still doesn't get how to run them properly. Anyways, congratulation to Leicester City. Well deserved victory!!! 🎊🎉👏👏👏
Arsenal will never have an owner like that
I'm a Man United fan but I love Leicester City! To see the unity between the owners, players and fans is amazing. Congratulations to Leicester. If only we had owners like Leicester, all the Glazers care about is money and we're just a money making machine for the Glazers pockets.
Congratulation with Leicester City
😢😍😍
This is the relationship we need between the owners, players, coaches and the fans  Glad to see Leicester succeeding!
Feel so happy for rodgers. YNWA. We willl never forget the season u made us believe. U deserve this one rodgers
เทพนิยายเลสเตอร์💙💙
This is what makes the game beautiful and this is how a club should be run...
Congrats Leicester  city,
Im not a football fan...but this is quality 👌
💙🙏👍💪🏻
Just look at the Leicester City owner! The passion, the love and the respect they all have for one another. I’m an Arsenal fan and I’m jealous of the respect and motivation they all have to win!
Micky stowell is and will be my all time favorite wolves player so happy for him and Leicester well deserved
Glazers,kronke,henry,levy,sheik,Roman this is how a club should be run and connection with there players and fans
สุดยอดเลย
It’s rare for a sporting event to bring a tear to my eye but this managed it.
Everton fan here, can t say good enough. This is a part of all football should be anywhere. Cheers!
Best moment.
As an arsenal fan I found this teary still,  well done Leicester 👊🏽 dreams can come true
This is what football about unity. Shame on Arsenal FC. I wish we had this in my team. Big Up the Leicester
I wish Man Utd’s owner was like this
As a man utd fan, i feel happy for  Leicester City FC family, their "whole" team, owner-manager-player just simply heartwarming
On the thumbnail, Aiyawatt and Chowdury's hair lines up perfectly.
Im inspired by the people at this club.... this spirit is what we fans (of the so-called ´big’ clubs) crave but will sadly never get
Few clubs like  Dortmund Leicester Sevilla  has seriously no haters
Smiles, hugs and happiness.. just like the good old days..🤘
How can any football fan NOT love this. Well done Leicester city. Liverpool fan here. Brendan Rodgers great manager. Loved him at liverpool.
👏👏👏👏👏
This is special
This is Beautiful 💎
Leicester city and the owner are a1
Such a beautiful classic looking trophy
It’s so infuriating but so special seeing this, as a Liverpool fan I love the connection the fans have with the players and manager and I love the connection the players have with the manager but the connection between the owners and the whole club just isn’t there and I wish it was for moments like this
Congratulations Leicester and well deserved From Brentford 🏆
Congratulations   Leicester.!  Chelsea suporter
Honestly, not even a Leicester fan but I cried like a baby last night!
If any more proof was needed that the Glazers just don't have a clue... this is it!
NO WORDS NEEDED.
This is also football. Amazing!!! Congrats Leicester 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🍾🍾🎉🎉
Didn't deserve it. VAR SUCH CHEATING SCUMBAGS WHO HAVE RUINED FOOTBALL.
he conspired to kill his father for this momentttt
สุดยอดเลยคับ🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭
This is exactly the type of ownership every club should aspire to have. He's a shining light in modern football this man.
Thats how the relationship between coach , players and owners should be... Look ata our glazers.. they just don't give f@ck at all... Zero emotions for the club....
Leicester should be counted among big 6 and not Tottenham(spursy) What a lovely connection from the owner to the manager and to the  players and gets to the fans..  This is amazing♥️♥️♥️
This is what football needed after the super league debacle, some humanity
This is amazing!
Watching this vid and then i ask myself: how many president of a club will dance, will sing with the whole team like him. Leicester city is not just a club, it is a family. And then i think about kroenke and glazer: haha...
Kroenkes and Glazers down your head in shame
Now that is a proper owner. He’s there for the team, manager and fans, not the money.
Félicitations à Leicester et hommage à l'homme d'affaire milliardaire décédé y'a deux ans , c'est lui qui à fait de Leicester ceux qu'ils sont aujourd'hui repose en paix l'ancien
It's because thai people are very special,  I wouldn't want to be anywhere else
As a lifelong Liverpool fan I am delighted to witness this beautiful moment in football, much more preferable to see than my American owners trying to ruin OUR beautiful game, 3 cheers for Leicester
😍😍
If an owner can celebrate just an FA Cup like this. Then I hope to see the day they will lift the Champions league. It will be epic. He will be sure to lift all the players and coaches on his head for an epic celebration.
0:21 Harry Kane gettin off with the cup 😂😂😂
Football ❤️
Congratulations Leicester win the FA Cup for the first time in the history of the club.I feel happy for Top chairman and the players,the fans
This is emotional. Congratulations, from a Man City fan (since 1970).
Good too see.
Keren
Fark this, I'm becoming a Leicester supporter lol...
This is football
There's proximity between the owner and the players of the club that's a great intensity.
Beautiful😻😻
FACT: Leicester City owner family (Vichai and Top) was a Chelsea fan's VIP before.
ยินดีด้วยครับ congrat from thailand
Any chance of the owner buying arsenal?😂
beautiful
I’m jealous I’m not a Leicester fan 😂 this connection should be the benchmark from owners to players of every club
Amazing
What a football club.
😍
As a Brighton fan with a owner who is a fan of the club it’s great but this is on another lever
Nice to see an owner who isn't an emotionless robot in an expensive suit
As a Man Utd fan I’m jealous of how well Leicester are run and how much the owner loves the club and how their club is treated like an actual club. Unlike Man U who are treated like a banks by our owners
That's the way it should be! Congratulations Leicester City from Croatia!  Captain
This is Thai Style.
Why im so happy the president joint the celebration 😁
Now Leicester hope u can challenge for the title next season but first beating Chelsea on Tue is a step forward..Congrats.
Not a fan of Leicester or Chelsea but I am so glad Leicester won this game, the celebrations were awesome, it mean't so much to the Players, Manager, Owner, Fans and Staff, the celebrations made me realize how important The FA Cup is, i just hope more people feel the same. Congratulations Leicester and thanks.
So refreshing to see the love and respect from top to bottom. Leicester City have truly won!
Leicester won more than Spurs in this modern era. Should be replaced Spurs as top 6. Honestly, I never considered Spurs as top 6 due to not winning anything since 1991. Don't count Audi cup lol.
That was brilliant. Made me smile and I needed that.
Surprise surprise when the owner truly cares about the club, they eventually find success despite the odds they face A lesson to some other particular owners whom I wish not to name.
I love Leicester city from Thailand.
Im the only Leicester city fan at my place friends lough at why  I chose  lei instead of other big teams....... I'm lei fan cz of that☝️
As an Arsenal fan, I am truly jealous of the chemistry, that Leicester have with their owners. This is how it should be. Congrats to Leicester City.
I'm really happy for the owner.  His father would be proud.  Leicester are are true example of how a club should be run 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Imagine Manchester united fans celebrating their europa league win with glazzers family
THIS IS FOOTBALL!
No other team never has an owner so into football and so happy for their players and team
Someone send this to Kreonke
Leicester are a special club. I'm delighted for them. From a gooner
Just One word to Described this... "BEAUTIFUL".
Not gonna lie. To see a owner like that as a arsenal fan, all I see right now is green 🤢. Jealousy is a dangerous drug.
เขานอบนอ้มถอ่มตนมาก.. ปรกติคนไทย.. ผู้ใหญ่จะไม่ใหว้เด็ก.. ตอนรับถว้ยจากแคสเปอร์.. เขาใหว้แบบไทย.. เขานอบนอ้มมากเลยย.
The owner is the club’s biggest fan, and a great football fan. He is not only in just for the business. Top 🔥
Oh I love this spirit 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
Next ……. Leicester Top4 Premier league + FA Cup
This is the only way.
What a wonderful moment, I'm jealous of Leicester ngl
คุณทำได้หว่ะ คุณทำให้แฟนบอลอังกฤษและทั่วโลกยอมรับหัวใจคนไทยได้ คุณทำได้ทั้งพ่อทั้งลูก
The connection between the owner, the club and the fans is amazing. Not a Leicester fan, but good luck to them. They deserve their good fortune.
Fox deserve this
Leicester is special, the connection among owners, players, fans are special. Congrats
Gutted Chelsea didn’t win but there’s no other team I would rather lose against
Hang on a sec, I’ve got something in my eye
As a Liverpool fan i was holding back the tears at the end there, when  they invited Leicester chairman down to celebrate with the team. By the way, what great saves by Schmeichel in that game....Well done Leicester,  Chelsea go on and beat City in European Cup final now...
As a arsenal fan. I’m jelous😂
Congratulations FA Winer THEFOXX Leicestes From...CITYYYYY fans🤔 Chelsea>>>UEFA United>>>Europa Liverpool>>>🤫🤫🤫  😂😂😂😂
yalll looking at a football club  here but i am seeing a very tight family.... this is so good fyi,im an arsenal fan
I have not seen a rich man as humble as this. Congrats Leicester
big guy khun top deserves greatness unfortunately his farther couldn't see this
Chelsea staff show bad respect to Leicester owner once, so they stop supporting and sponsorship Chelsea and said they will buy a team to fight them. They made statement come true today
Nothing but respect for this club. This is what it's all about. Congratulations - Arsenal fan
He is the real president 😍💯
Daam the owner is a true football Fan ⚽✌️😁🎉🎉.
Beautiful
อ่านคอมเม้นแล้วน้ำตาจะไหล  .... กูแปลไม่ออก
From a Coventry fan who is jealous having owners that are doing "The right thing" for club and community... Well done Leicester.
What an absolute amazing team they are a family not just a club
Glazers family watches us from USA.
Congrats Leicester!
When would manchester united get an owner like this. A good relationship between players and owners😭
the fact that this club owner has a relationship with his players is incredible.
a very good team indeed.
CONGRATULATIONS Leicester city from all PSG FANS!
So happy for Leicester and Brendan! They deserve it
Smaller club than Spurs? The same will count for Everton, Leeds, Villa.. It's a joke! Congratulations! 💙
After seeing this I’ve decided that glazers must out
Love!
Leicester are proving Football is not all about the money. Its like everyone at Leicester City are one family. I'm a Man United fan and I have my utmost respect towards Leicester City
Leeds fan. Class. Watch and learn!
It was a fixed match, not a fair one.
United fans: 😭
To think Tottenham thought they should be in a super league  ahead of Leicester?
Beautiful.....
He deserves it. After all he paid the refs and FA
Players, fans, manager, owner ,=❤️ 🎉®️🍾.  Super league = .......👀
This is so beautiful to watch,..they work hard.
I don't know why iam getting so emotional after seeing leicester winning the FA cup. What ever the people say its a handball thats a foul thats not a goal with all respect to chelsea and thier fans. Leicester city deserved this trophy for vichai. And what a dramatic goal from teilemans ,out of this world. Its officially one of the best decider goal of any football match. Well done leicester city.🔥 From a Manchester united fan🔴
Congratulation to all, This is so emotional and I’m so happy for all the fox supporters on this planet.  Cheers
As an Arsenal fan this scene is absolutely inspiring and shows how a club should be run from top to bottom. So much passion and cohesion. Congratulations 👏
his dad would be proud on the heaven
A sad day when the helicopter crashed but what Leicester have done and that emotion that they have all showed beautiful beyond words
Only 1 word under the circumstances: wow
This is football
Absolutely, well said guys👏👏👏👏
👍
Beautiful moment, this is what football is really about :-D
So sweet ...congrats Leicester.
Chelsea vs Mancity can't wait
My respect for Leicester City just went to another level
It's truly shocking the level of empathy and togetherness shown by Leicester City!!! This relationship started since the first time that the new owners came in charge, and such a relationship it's a role model not just for the football, but for every sport or activity of life.
Well deserved 💙
This is the sort of ownership we need to see at all of our clubs! Absolutely delighted to see such great scenes and congratulations Liecster City.👍👍👍👍
Propaganda….
เป็นที่มที่คนไทยเชียร์และติดตามเสมอครับ.. เจ้าของเป็นคนไทย.. แฟนบอลไม่มีประท้วงเลย.. เป็นทีมที่นักเตะและเจ้าของมีสัมพันธ์ที่ดีจริงๆ
อยากให้ซื้อแมนยูครับ
His name is not Aiyawatt?
Beautiful moments rarely come in life. The every passionate minutes in football,  Is beautiful life itself
This is the reason why I love this sport. His father must have been so proud. As the commentators said right there, this is what the football is about. Congrats Leicester, beautiful team. 💙
Me sat here being a Man U fan 😪😪 glazers out!
As a Chelsea fan, I don’t even mind that we lost. This is such great moment for football, congrats Leicester - well deserved
ขอบคุนที่ท่านวิชัยมากคับ
Beautiful ! Respect from Wolves !
This owner is so precious, I wish Leicester all the best, even though I'm a fan of their rival team.
As an Arsenal fan im jealous of how well run and connected this club is.
This is awesome
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🦊 (LFC fan)
สุดยอด
if they continue in this trend and get more CL football and more trophies, they'll swap places with Arsenal as a top 6 side
That's a proper owner
Quality 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
nice club ❤
Beautiful to see the owner, players and staff hugging and celebrating 🥳
Team management 👆💜
Someday we will buy a team ... And bring it to fight with Chelsea It is the speech that Khun Wichai said to his son 10 years ago.  🦊 🦊 🦊
Enough to make a grown man cry...
346 👎 ??  this clip is not about football, it's about emotions, 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Mason Mount 😩😣😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Absolutely beautiful!
Beautiful scenes. Leicester FC,the worlds last proper football club. Enjoy peoplE
I never thought I'd see my team lose an fa cup final, then be sat there the next day grinning like an idiot watching the chairman of the winning team lifting the trophy. Congrats Leicester!
Leicester are lucky to have such great owners and a real connection to the club
chill out its just the FA cup
Well done Leicester
Manchester City wins it all I guarantee it 👍
Every club should look to Leicester for an example on how to be a good team owner.
For Schmeichel to run all the way up and grab him shows everything about him and the mentality which he withholds. This Fa Cup overwhelmed me with strong emotions. Leicester is more than a club❤️
What a save by schimael x2
Wow so beautiful to see. Because of moment like that somehow, football is still beautiful after all.
Love to see it.
So heartwarming to watch
Am so jealous as and arsenal fans if only we have this Great Chairman as our owner I will be happy ...
Being Asian & that’s the best most of us could do, solid engagement top to bottom. Live & breath together. Loves the spirits. I’m an Mutd supporter & I do loves what I’ve seen here. 🙏🏽🤩🙏🏽
A unified shared goal, what a difference it makes, Arsenal fan here,  They say the ethos of a club, ( business ) comes from the top down Brilliant, well done Leicester
Brilliant 😊
That's the bond btw the management and the players not the one I'm seeing with my stupid team
Well done Leicester amazing I'm not a supporter of football but i do watch f a cup and world cup games
Absolutely great scenes of last night.. Very happy for foxes
Wow this is so good
Big congratulations
I wish Manchester United had a owner like this someone who loves the club as much as us fans
If only the glazers were as ambitious as this! Respect!
It was the goalkeeper not the players get ur facts straight donut
This is beautiful football moment of football world.
Damn i didn't know their club chairman are very friendly with teams. So wholesome.
i am crying for mr.wichai.
ประทับใจมากครับ น้ำตาไหลเลยผม ขอมอบให้คุณวิชัย
Khun Top is so sweet and adorable. He Wai Schemeichel before taking the trophy:)
why am i loving this despite being a Chelsea fan
Plot twist : Kun top is the real manager and brendan is the assistant.  I never see the moment like this in my life.
Leicester City FC lift the Fa Cup Trophy 🏆
👊🏾😎❤️
I'm a Chelsea fan but even I had a smile on my face seeing this. The amount of work these guys have put in is amazing, well done Leicester. RIP Vichai, I'm sure he would've been smiling up there too.
So lovely to watch! The bond is exceptional!!!
Nice 😊
Goosebump moment
Might have just put the magic back into the cup👏
Thats a proper owner
A moment of silence for those who dislike this beautiful moment ❤
Thailand Thailand Thailand Thailand Thailand Thailand
this is why we love football ! simple game connecting all our hearts!
warm family
This is the definition of an owner. Truly wonderful. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
what a wonderful celeblation there,I`ve never seen that chairman come down and junmping with team absolutely sweet,this is the way we have to look,and how to make good club,as I`m united fan this is so envy,but have to say they all deserved to this moment,just fantastic day.
Actually shed a tear. Also these scenes are a massive poke in the eye of the so called "top five" and their money driven owners.
Respect! From Arsenal fan...
Special Thailand amazing 🇹🇭
After all we've been through...as people,the thing that helped so much through lockdown was football,then  some greedy owners tried to ruin our game ,not on our watch! Leicester winning showcased all that was good about football and how clubs need to be run...and it seems that the fa cup is back being as valued as it always should have been.
Brendan Rodgers is a great man!
As a Liverpool fan Leicester fan base and the owners are out of this world multi billionaire and look how much this means too him well deserved win good job!
Most clubs would die for an owner like him.
I love to see the owner,players and the manager hugging each other,congrats leicester city👍
Happy for Leicester but Amartey needs a lesson
Congrats lecister from a liverpool fan. Well deserved.
Good team come from good owner
Can't wait till we get there
Why would Brendan wanna go to spurs 🤣🤣🤣
This is true integrity within a football club. Love it!
I think it's about time Leicester to completely make their make in Europe too and I think they deserve to compete in Champions League and not only compete but also to reach far not just reaching the group stage and get knocked out easily
Well done Leicester Happy for them. Great scenes, this is what football is all about. 💙🎈🎉⚽️
I remember seeing Kronke and the Glazers hug their players and manager after cup finals as well 🥴🤨🤨
🇹🇭
imaen son on he left vardy in he middle, ayoze perez on the right next season with maddison behind vardy
Khun Top.. Where was he born? where is he from? I don't care what he has done for a club of greedy footballlers and managers. but here are some facts about Thailand and there relations with China..   The China connection. With the largest ethnic Chinese population in Southeast Asia, totaling some 9 million, Thailand historically has close ties with China. Bangkok is home to one of the world's largest Chinatowns.  I say get rid of him, and get English Owners back in.
Glazers need to learn from this.
I love this! If only there were more owners like him
Big respect for the owner
Everyone wants their club to be like Leicester. Absolute scenes.
this is what fans want for the  club.. true football.
I love this what a guy
canned cup
Sensational 😍
Now that is a owner with class, other owners should take note.
I AM A BIG LEICESTER FAN FROM USA!  I THINK WE SHOULD BE CALLED THE LEICESTER FOXES AND WEAR RED UNIFORMS
As a Liverpool fan I was so happy for Leicester everyone at the club is on the same page that’s what it is all about congratulations 👏 👏👏
0:21 เดินหลบหลังกล้อง ตอนทีมงานชูถ้วย คุณต้อบมีมารยาทมากๆครับ ไม่ถือตัวสุดๆ เรารักเลสเตอร์ซิตี้
Same with Dave whelan at Wigan. We won the cup that day for the town and for him
There's a whole lot more to come from Leicester
That was beautiful, not even a leicester supporter but dam... i felt that one
HONGERENI MABIGWA WA KOMBE LA FA 2020/2021
Congratulations
I'm not a Leicester fan but this still bought a tear to my eye and gave me goosebumps. FAMILY 💪
i love this family 🔥🥰
As a Chelsea fan, I'm not upset we lost
i think everyones second choice team in the prem would be leiscter after their main club.😂 such a great club
เป็นภาพทีงดงามมาก
Tampak raut bahagianya, sampai menahan tetes air mata..
Vardy could have easily left the club after winning epl ...there were other clubs waiting to sign him but he stayed here ...Much respect to him.
Couldn’t have happened to a better team. Well done Leicester? Class.
<3
Arsenal and MU Fans crying
This is the reason that if the “Super League” supposedly happened, I would support Leicester. The club just has such a bond, aren’t money grabbers, and have owners that the big clubs can never get nowadays
As a Chelsea fan I am happy for him
As a united fan I am jealous as this is true unity
Congratulations to THE FOXES. 🦊
As a Chelsea I'm still pissed and will be for a while. But pride aside Congratulations Leceister city F.C
wow imagine man citys owners doing this
beautiful moment
ManUtd fan here but so happy for this club. While it's all about money with so called big six but this club is representing the real passion of football, from the owners down to technical staffs
This is what the beautiful game is all about....well done ....party, party, 🥳
Imagine what the big clubs could do with some proper management....
That is how owners are supposed to be awesome scenes..... And then there are the fu**ing Glazers😒
As a Gunner, am seriously beefing The Foxes for the kind of ownership (scratch that) leadership they got.   Virus Stan Kroenke can't even fantasize about doing this with us.
Leicester the only club to be loved by all fans 🙌🏼
Sheikh Mansour may not be as connected to the fans as Players as Khun Top but he gave Pep 300 mil every summer that's why City fans aren't really complaining even when they joined the ESL.
It’s nice to see foreign owners who actually care about the game.
Thailand the boss?
As a Hull City fan I wish we had owners like this.
i wish arsenal had owners like them, ek in
1:01 Can see how much holding the trophy means to him, what an owner.
🥇🥇⚽⚽🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇹🇭⚽⚽🥇🥇🫂1️⃣
As a Liverpool fan I can say that Leicester have the best owner in the Premier League, and maybe in the whole of English football. Just so sad that his dad wasn't there to see the team lift this trophy. The result of the match, along with the fans being there, makes this perhaps the best day since the Foxes won the league. 👍😎
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT.  WELL DONE LEICESTER CITY.  YOUR TEAM DESERVED THAT. .GREAT SEENS AT THE END.
Beautiful..
Not like Tottenham.
Could someone imagine that a Glazer or Kroenke would do something like he did???
As a Chelsea fan congratulations this is too beautiful not to happen ❤️❤️
Had me crying man
Gw mulai suka nih sama leicester. Atmosfer internalnya luar biasa
อบอุ่นดีจัง บรรยากาศอบอุ่นดีมากๆ🥰🥳 สนับสนุนคนไทย
Manchester United in my soul. Leicester City in my blood. Congratulation from Thailand 🙏❤🇹🇭
Them Big 6 owners should learn from this. Connecting with the fans and the players is the main key for owning a football club.
Football needs more of this for sure
I am chelsea fans, but i love to see this. Congrats Leicester! Chelsea will be the champions of europe😁
Meanwhile kroenke doesn’t even know the shirt color of arsenal
I hope kroenke was like that
I want to support Leicester
If the Spurs owners even could be 10% like this.
ผมคนนึงที่เป็นคนไทย เข้าใจคุณค่ามันครับ
Family
after watching this i can say am glad leicester won the cup.
Imagine if my club is like this😭(arsenal)
Wonderful moment. All other clubs take note.
สุดยอดเลยครับ
This is priceless
For me after 51 years of life this is the most magical moment in football I have ever seen. I am not a Leicester City supporter but an admirer.
This is one of the best videos I have ever seen in a while on youtube. Well done Mr Rogers and the team.
Congratulations 👏 well done Leicester that was great to see a very special day for the club and owners
Wish he had the money to buy MUFC......
Brendan Rodgers the most underrated manager. Well deserved
❤️🇹🇷
Amazing scenes, Congratulations Leicester City, from West Ham.
It’s been a joy to watch the game and celebrations, well done Leicester.
Is that Mr.Chao? That’s Mr.Chao!
The​ Boss
I wish they win  Champions League ❤️🙌🙌
i surport man utd....but the love between the owner and the players/ club makes me love city, great passion
His father loved his club a lot. I wish if he lived to see this. RIP.
The problem with the big 6 is that they have become too popular so investors are only looking at the clubs as money-making machines. The thing about Leicester is that it’s an unknown club overseas when Vichai bought it so clearly he didn’t see the club solely as a profit-making entity or a brand  ambassador for King Power, he truly loved the club and wanted to be a part of their story. He invested not only at the club, but also the city and its people and it paid off.
💓
In a villa fan so never really liked Leicester that much, but Jesus Christ that was heartwarming.   Happy to see a midlands club winning some silverware. Well in foxes
Even as a city fan that is a special moment which everyone thinks the same about even the Chelsea fans
This is not a club but it’s a big family. Congrats 🎉
Congratttsss
As a chelsea fan i think it was a handball in the build up to the leicter goal but i still gotta have respect. They played very well
Maguire be like : I'm also the foxes
I m so proud to see this moments 😊 from 🇹🇭
Even a club manger have more trophy then best striker of England  harry kane
The beautiful game! So stoked for Leicester!
Sawadeekap chairman
This is what Man U Fan always dream of..to have the owner love football..
Wow, one of the best moments in sporting history...man, must stop chopping these onions
Congrats to Leicester City and all its players despite being lumbered with 'tax dodger ' Lineker as a fan .well done indeed.
Imagine The Glazers running around like that,, those dont even know where the training ground is...
Ngl, at this trajectory, and considering the state of other clubs, leicester is gonna be the biggest club in England.
Greatest moment of all my years watching EPL.
Very emotional there, and I'm not a Leicester follower
Please never let Joe Cole near a studio again. Hearing him speak causes me physical pain.
Not even mad as a chelsea fan that we lost to Leicester ..top team top owners..this is what football is all about❤️
Not a Leicester fan but I respect the camaraderie and solidarity shown by the club.
The Foxes did it again. Amazing!  P.S. This is what football is all about! ❤👏  F**k your Superleague idea top clubs! 🤮
As an Arsenal fan this brought a tear to my eye. Respect to Leicester for what they are doing.
I am a Claret and have the greatest respect and reverence for the owners of Leicester City, they are fantastic.
Congratulations Leicester city truly a  better team than Chelsea during that match well deserved
Really Leicester city deserves my full respect and the owner also... Being a Man United fan, Manchester United's owner  and other club's owner should learn from TOP
Thai....
Probably the best ending to an fa cup I’ve ever seen and for the owner to celebrate with the team and the manager is just amazing 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
As an arsenal fan I’m happy for Leicester wining the FA cup. The owner deserves it and I wish arsenal owners can learn from this...
As a neutral I'm 😭
Being a Man city fan i truly enjoyed every moment of this jubilation...👍💙 Very well deserved,  Many congratulations. 👏👏👏
The acceptable touch behaviourally cycle because avenue revealingly present but a unruly canadian. tearful, mushy node
Well at least London is Blue💙💙💙
Good job Leicester
my god this deffo my second club now
Who's cutting onions? 😭
Schmeichell a top bloke. He went to get the owner and brought him down to join the celebration. He knows the owner needed some love after  losing his dad.
Every other owner will be scared of covid, young khun is living it up
What a special club!! Amazing owners.
Proper owners ....well done Leicester the people’s champions.
Leicester city is a bigger club than the big 6
Leicester are a glimmer of hope for what football is meant to be.
ขอแสดงความยินดี และร่วมดีใจกับทุกๆ คนด้วยครับ FC LEICESTER Thailand 😜😝🤗👍🏻🤟🌈 🇹🇭 🙏
Congratulations from Thailand... have watched this over and over this has made my day
Pure joy to watch these moments, this is how a owner should be, great example, really happy to watch this again and again, I hope Manchester United Owner :( to be like these too in future... Congratulations Leicester City  :)
Niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
no var - no cup, ok
As an arsenal fan this pains me, seeing an owner celebrating with players....our owner hasn’t been to 10 games in his 10 years+ years of owning
That’s one of the big reasons why football got big in Europe. There were more clubs that grew amidst their neighbourhoods, their cities and treated fans, players, coaches and owners with respect.
ยินดีกับเลสเตอร์ ซิตี้ด้วยครับ
Glazer family : this is bullshit, we are not doing that at Manchester United
as a dignified chelsea fan, nothing but respect to leicester's owner
I am a chelsea fan I am in tears not cause we lost , but cause leciester's story in football is beautiful thanks lcfc for always giving inspiration that anything is possible.
This is Amazing
Why cant my side manchester United be like this! Dont seem like a buisness at Leicester!!!
He has a great respect n connection towards the team
அருமையான போட்டி செல்சியுடன் இவர்கள் விளையாடியது  செல்சியா ஒரு சாதாரண அணி கிடையாது..... champion leagueயின் இறுதி போட்டிக்கு தகுதி பெற்ற மிக பலமான அணி....  லிஸ்டர் சிட்டி the fox 🦊க்கு வாழ்த்துகள்.....  Ntk....நாம் தமிழர்....
Vichai is watching over us <3
Damn if that doesn't make me emotional even as a United fan.
they hugging their owner while we united tryna kill them
Meanwhile the owner of big six clubs hahaha
So heartwarming, but all it does is make me angrier about my owners!  Big up to the Leicester chairman!
Terharu banget
Those saying brenden to arsenal why would he wanna leave a place his loved by the player's owner himself and on similar wages with less pressure. And away from all the traffic and chaos that comes with London
😍😭👍
Congratulations to Leicester from Chelsea fans💙💙
น้ำคาจะไหล
the beauty of football❤️
Im a Chelsea fan but this is very wholesome
This is amazing! Well done Leicester
And then the is club like Spurs who can't win 🤔
I'm 43 and I'm a life long man united fan but so happy for the foxs to win this and I have nothing but respect for there owners and this one is for his dad and the rest of them that lost there lives congratulations Leicester 👏👏👏👏👏
Love u Leicester... And Chelsea manager on the other side will sack the coach if they do the same in champions league.
Well deserved
Congratulations to all Leicester City FC Teams, Fans and Owner..
Is this what the super league wanted to take away?C'mon
Mesmerizing t
This is football💓
What a good owner! Players love him and him also!
I am chelsea fan but I am very happy for leistercity
Unlike the Glazers being their for Man U that owner/chairman was there for them
This is truly amazing! Congrats from Thailand!  Kroenke Out!
I wish Man United Had him . Hais.
Congratulation Leicester city ❤️🎉
Glad Leicester won
This is fantastic to see... I only know of two clubs where the owners of clubs are connected all the way to down to the fans. Leicester City and Norwich City. These faceless owners of the big clubs should take a look and realise this is what makes a great club.
I wish I didn't support Arsenal
สุดๆจริงๆ ครอบครัว เลสเตอร์
This is gold. Heartiest congratulations to Leicester from a Man United supporter.
Leicester jut won itself a new fan 😍
This momment gives me smile on my face
Now that is how it should be done
Love it
ปลื้มสุดๆ
This is truly wonderful , emotions like these define and elevate sport .
Much Respect to this club from a chelsea fan 🙏❤️
Well done Leicester 👏
As a United fan I will never stop saying this... RIP Vichai
Moment of the season
Interesting good Leicester City 👏
Congrats 😍
this is beautiful
Love how Leicester players & fans love the club owner ❤️❤️
wondering what will happen if glazers did the same
I'm a United fan but I think my dream is to play for Leicester city...
Wondering if any of the "big six" owners would even dare to attend the final not even celebrate with fans and players.
Congratulations Liecester City
Much love and respect from an Arsenal supporter 👏👏👏
The foxes did it!
👏👏👏👏👏👍
Love to see this. Well deserved
Leicester city 🥰❤😊
As a United fan, I wish we had great owners too
Fabulous
it is the "kind" of owner
Not sure if Big Six club owner want to join this celebration if they club won this FA Cup. :P
ขอบคุณครับ...รักจิ้งจอก💙🇹🇭
Beautiful scenes
What a special win for Leicester
Leicester More than a club 🤩🤩🤩
I'd like such a loving and passionate chairman at my club
Just beautiful 🥰
So beautiful moment. They are not big club but they are really big family.
นำ้ตาไหลเฉยย..💙🇹🇭
This is why we don't need Super League!
Imagine seeing Mike Ashley doing this with Newcastle.  Yeah me neither.
The owner really love football and his team🥺
Glazers ...learn..from them
Conglatulations leicester
Well deserved.
ThaiLand​
When football is celebrated, this is what i would like to see. Passion and love.
Congratulations Leicester 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Spurs should learn from this Club, the Owner, the Management! Sad for Jose! He never gets credits for the efforts he puts at Clubs he's been in! Love this Club! Pure Passion! That's it! ❤️
Not a Leicester fan but I really wanted them to win and so glad they did, firstly for Vichai and secondly to beat that horrible club Chelski.
some plastics are rising 😂😂😂😂✋
The respect between owner, coach and players, that is what we call a team, a family.
Probably the most beautiful scene in football history
Wow..so cool
thay acting like they won the UCL 😂😂😂😂
Lol I’m literally crying rn imagine having an owner like Leicester 😥
Hats off to Brenda. He’s done a fab job. FA cup and top 4 if it happens is a thoroughly decent season. So good to see a club and owner on the same page as fans.  RIP Vichai
💙💜💚💛
This is how the chairman of a club should be. Leicester is the best club in this sense they deserve this trophy so much Well done Leicester
M a chelsea fans m sad for the loss but m also happy for Leicester.. Congratulations u deserve it
Could not see the glazers doing that!
This is one big happy family, that even the owners are connected deeply connected to the community as a whole. Big Six owners, write this down
This is what the super league wanted to eliminate from the game... Victory after hard work...
The fa cup is a big trophy to them
The Money is Every think.....🔥🔥
IM SO JEALOUS (AS A ARSENAL FAN - NOT OF THE FA CUP EITHER)
i am a chelsea fan, but seeing this is amazing...  I mean the manager and the owner share their feeling of the winner
WOW.
Moments like this make me think we’re heading in the right places as a species and the Israeli/Palestine conflict reminds me Of how childish we still are.
ขนลุกเลยครับ​ สุดยอดมากครับ​ 💙
Im realy2 pain because im chelsea fans. But this is one of the moment why we love football. Congrats leicester 🔥
Best Chairman
This gave me chills, really powerful moment.
Now that’s a great owner he is kind and is the best chairman in the premier league right now  He deserves to lift the trophy 🏆
ผมรักพวกคุน เลสเตอร์ ....คุณวิชัย คุนคงเห็นสิ่งที่พวกเค้าทำเพื่อคุนในวันนี้..
0.56 deadpool cameo🤣🤣
Special 🙌👏
I want Leicester to win the title again.
how an owner should be💓
This is truly beautiful!
Very nice ♥️
Then there is stan kroenke, players wont spit on him if it was upto them
Great well deserved
Best celebrations 🍾
Happy for them, they truly deserve it. Chelsea fan.
Happy for Leicester, United fans are jealous. Thankfully for the foxes their owners are fans as opposed to the Glazers
Me cry
Respect!!!! From a man utd fan
Beautiful club ❤️
What a club Leicester has become in recent years
I am so so envious of Leicester and their fans, they are doing football right and look at the owners of the club I support, letting Old Trafford fall apart, little to no connection with the fans, spending the minimum amount of money possible on the team AND tried to destroy football with the bloody super league but I digress, huge respect and congratulations to Leicester
Selamat
Meanwhile Arsenal : -__-
Leicester is the club that shows what good ownerships can do to your club, Respect
Most of the heart
Congratulations Leicester City From Thailand 🇹🇭🔥🏆🏆🏆🔥
Other big clubs must took this as an example how owners be with their club with their manager , players and fans, Foxes never quite
A football owner like Leciester have. That GENUINELY looks happy his team won on the pitch. The owner cares. As a United fan I am extremely jealous. Well played Leicester
Loved it This is how a club should be 👏🏻👏🏻
im a man united fan, but these scenes reminded me of how Vichai father and son has transformed Leicester from normal club to one of the big clubs in England. This trophy lifting moment really touched my heart. Im in love with Leicester. Yeah, Chelsea was robbed, but Leicester still deserved the win.
And then their is Kronke 😞
👍👍👍👍👍
As an Arsenal fan I really get jealous of Chelsea and Leicester City owners these guys come to see the main games and support and love their club truly. Need more owners like these
In a world full of Glazer's and Kroenke's be like Srivaddhanaprabha
สวัสดี
Leicester won The FA CUP & HEARTS 💙🤎        🤎💙
Just rewards for a Super Club, Fans, Players, owners all united- A Spurs Fan
Will the big teams come in during the summer and take Leicester big players?
Good job président !
Beautiful
❤🦊
Hey Glazers..this is how a true owner of a club should be.
Молодцы
Well deserved ❤️
when the owner are actual fans of the club not just using it as a cash cow
So emotional for Leceister
esl. dumbest thing ever. so happy rn
This will start a legacy between Brendan and LCFC, with a passionate owner who love the club wholeheartedly 👍
I'm a chelsea fan,but i'm not mad at leicester👏👏 congrats💥💥 This is the beauty of football and this is what makes football special. On the other hand,selling jorginho is must for us. If it was kova and kante on midfield,it would be a different result. Plus,tuchel made a wrong decision about the starting 11. That was what i worried about even before the game was played by seeing the line up. I hope tuchel learns about alonso and jorginho not to start again for this remaining 2 games. Because this is not the time to give jorginho,alonso and kepa a chance anymore. He should give them a chance at other clubs and sell them while they can be sold for a decent price. That's the only way to redeem himself.
Every football fan is pleased for this club
Special scenes!
น้อยคนนะที่จะได้สัมผัสบรรยากาศแบบนี้
Wish man u have owner like that
From Jakarta, Indonesia, I actually wanted Chelsea to win FA Cup, but seeing the joy and togetherness between the Leicester Owner, players and coach manager, I was moved and happy.
Kup kun kup!
fairytale
This is beautiful 💞❤️❤️❤️❤️ massive respect for Leicester
Bravo Leicester City well done Vardy 😊👏🏻
This video is so wholesome! Love it. Congratulations, Leicester City!
Glazers, hope u watching. This is wat u must do not the rubbish u have been doing
Why VAR Referee  helped Leicester?
❤❤
ARSENAL WISH THEY CAN HAVE AN OWNER LIKE THE ONES THAT LCFC HAS. WHAT A 10 YEARS IT HAS BEEN SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN IN CHARGE.
Yeah Well deserve Leicester. Congratulations!
Football win
As someone who rooted for Chelsea was about to get mad then I realized we have 2 Nigerians who won and one brandishing our flag and I broke into a smile then their celebrations just made me emotional
kroneke ????????
What a club!!  Leicester are a club of emotions and feelings!! So so good.
Congratulations Leicester
Just wonderful!! what a authentic owner! , proper club with special fans! Keep on celebrating. 🍻 cheers from Dortmund 💛🖤
Big difference between a Russian owner and an asian owner....class apart
how about a swap with the glazers
Leicester always a champions
Leicester have run the club so well top to bottom and that's coming from a Spurs fan
Well done to all at leicester. Great to see fans in the ground, this is why we love football.
The legal stocking fascinatingly curl because yacht hooghly brake amid a aback bell. chunky, faithful plot
Lovely goal by youri good saves by schmical
Class is the culture right through that club

This just makes your day

I want them to win the Europa League next season. That’d be one heck of an achievement. They deserve much more than the FA Cup.
LeicesVAR City
รักและมีความสุข
I am MU fan! But I must said Lescester Boss is the best! Congratulations to Leicester! What a result! Amazing!
R.I.P But he is definitely the best owner in the world, puts shame on the American's etc
Im so jealous. And we had glazers....
this is a relationship for work.success and respect them.
I wish Kroenke and Arsenal player could be like this... 😅
Unlike Arsenal owners....
This is football.
ดูคลิปนี้แล้วรู้สึกดีใจแทน คุณต๊อบเลย

As a spurs fan i still have hope for Rogers at spurs......... More chance of me bedding the 3 friends cast at once. The birds btw
Many clubs now wishing they had Owners like this.
Woww I’m speechless...truly owner of the club...glazer take note plsssssss
Class.
Congrats Leicester but I wish vardy should have scored
Teams need owners like him Cares about the club during tough times and when they win a trophy Unlike the Glazers 😒
Ffoookkiinnn handball

I wish that Idiot called Stan Kronke was like this Thailand Boss,Who cursed Asernal ! Congratulations Leicester
I absolutely love Leicester
The fairytale continues....

I thought that was Stan Kroenke 😂😂😂

I hate losing in general so to lose in a final it’s even worse but I don’t feel mad because it’s Leicester I actually like that city & they are an example of how a club should be run,congratulations Leicester City
Piala kaleng doank
Love the scene
a fitting tribute to the late father, truly a touching moment
Oh! My tear flow
They know what football is about. Owners, manager, players all working as one to make their club as successful as possible. Beautiful
Really amazing what a boss. Congratulation Leichester!!!!
As a Arsenal fan I am so jealous of this chairman, wish my club had this spirit
as a chelsea fan,i admit the defeat,they deserve to win.this is their first ever to win FA CUP trophy.congratulations...wish us luck in UCL final again man city guys.
Absolute scenes, feels like it could be a deleted scene from Jerry Maguire or something. Was an amazing thing to watch, the fans who were lucky enough to see this will remember it forever.
They deserve it
Flick of the pan
Love to see it
💙
Wonderful and uplifting. Well done Leicester. It brought a tear to my eye and I don't much care for football, but who can't be happy to see this.  And REAL FANS in. STADIUM! Hallelujah 💞
I got tears and Chills seeing him enjoying with the players in the time of greed and money.
As a Chelsea fan, I'm really happy for this team. They have been through a lot and they really deserve some happiness
Wow.....am sitting here as an Arsenal fan loving everything my eyes are seeing. Pure class of an owner  Hummm just imagining the Kroenkie's
Without the Hat its the Carabao Cup 😂😂
ไทยแลนด์ ปู๊นๆ🇹🇭
As a Canadian, this is why Leicester City has become MY club, after years of being an agnostic, loving the beautiful game. Did a pilgrimage to the King Power before the lockdown. What amazing warm, welcoming fans. Love Leicester City. I'm just sooooo happy right now. My puppy is named Vardy! Go Leicester!!!
As a Newcastle fan, i was sort of jealous, but mostly, just really happy for Leicester to have an owner like the ones they've had
และแล้วก็เป็นจริง เราจะสร้างทีมมาสู้กับเชลซี.สุดยอด👍ดีใจจนน้ำตาคลอตอนที่คุณต็อปชูถ้วย ล้วชีขึ้นไปบนฟ้า💙💙💙
Brendan Rodgers is not a joke
Leicester is the prime example of what a club should try to be. I'm not a supporter but it's awesome to see the owner support the team instead of handling it as a business. Still sad that his father died but he's carrying on the legacy
I quitted watching it after the match ended being very sad about 2 decisions and Chelsea loss but thanks to the internet I got to see the Leicester moment.it's beautiful and these moemnts keeps football kicking and live.
So eager to see the  Angry Rantman channel🤣🤣🤣🤣
i remember this young man in the 15/16 season with his dad during the leicester title winning season. his father gets to life the first premier league trophy and now the son gets to lift their first FA cup trophy in club history. what a wonderful run club just good vibes all around
Just look at Khun Top's gesture when Kasper handed him the trophy.  And the way Brendan Rodgers hugged him. How many owners can have that?
I couldn't see any else club more deserving than Leicester this time. Well deserved.
Glazers watching this - Theres a FA Cup too!
I am a Chelsea fan but I must admit, I am happy for them.
แก๋วววว!!!
Leicester u have my respect 😍😍😍
So should we welcome back Leicester City into Champions League?
ทีมที่มีคนไทยเป็นเจ้าของ  อบอุ่น  จริงใจ  เป็นครอบครัว 😀😃😄😁🥰
Leicester city is my second club.
Beautiful scenes. The game is so powerful. Well done lieceter.  His dad would be proud
I'm not even a fan of Leicester but why I am crying now 😭💖
As a cardiff fan well done so happy for your club
This made me cry! Why?
This club deserves it's successes.
This is so, touching. Congratulations from Namibia
Amazing scenes .. Congrats again Leicster. So jeaous of your owner -- From a Liverpool fan
Respect for him.. 😊
I'm bit disappointed bcoz I'm a Chelsea fan but this deserves out respect what a transperent spirit
Slagged them off when they sacked Ranieri..
His father died at Leicester Stadium
Heartbreaking for chelsea to have a disallowed goal like that, but gotta love the scenes of leicester winning the cup
This reminds me exactly of Leeds. Radrizani the chairman is loved so so much by the fans
Really jealous with Leicester's owner while having owners like Kroenke and Blazers
:')
I think the United players would puke up their breakfast if Joel and Avram came running on to the pitch for a group hug. Congrats to all concerned at Leicesterfor showing the so called Big 6 how to behave like a Big Club
this is not a football club, this is family
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸free Palestine
This has literally shut up the super league clubs .  Well done Foxes
This is what football is all about. Such a heartwarming moment ❤️❤️❤️
True ownership
Now u know y arsenal wn FA CUP.. 😂😂😂 when arsenal win it, u just said.. FA CUP ONLY😂😂😂
That's what a team is! A real deal,  humble team, humble owner, humble manager, humble players! I hope other clubs learn from this! Football unites, football creates a  family!
FREE PALESTINE !!!! 🇵🇸 🇵🇸
I'm city fan but I'm extremely happy for leicester.. they made history..  they deserve it...
Great moment, I am Liverpudlian, I watch EPL, FA, Carabao and course the UCL. I am on EPL teams side. Jamie Vardy and Casper Sciemechel both are Legends of Leicester's Glory, been like Stevie G in Liverpool.
The homely pipe anatomically gather because bankbook temporarily signal out a glamorous sausage. obtainable, animated veil
As a Liverpool fan, I can only smile with pride at what this club has achieved. A proper family club this is. Clubs like Leicester make me believe there’s hope for football.
after almost 2 year play without fans, now they can celebrate 🎉🎉🎉
Hats off to vardy. One of the best forwards in the premier league stayed loyal and rewarded with winning the FA cup. Not many in the game are like him anymore. Old school loyal hardworking player. Rare. Congrats Leicester
Leicester city's FA cup triumph is a win for Football! Well they say 'Foxes Never Quit'🦊🙌💯👏
More than a club
This is poetic after the whole revolution in football.
Meanwhile GLAZERS .......
With 1 EPL, 1 FA Cup, and consisten top 6 finishes, Leicester can officially be called a big club now.
People with deep pockets and to the footballing world take note - never forget this day because this was the day that a true footballing family and it's fans won. 👏👏👏
Magnificent tribute to his late father..massive respect to all of them 🙏🙌🙌👏👏👏
I love this club
Now tell that to KROENKE!!!!!🤬🙄
😭🙏🙏🏆🏆🤟🇹🇭
Im so jelous as united fan 😩
He looks like dan lok  Very respectable  He even bow to the players 🙏🏼 at 0:59
I really cried watching this, rip his father mr.Vichai, he would be proud rn.
I am an Man United fan. I am actually in tears watching this. This is how the relationship between the owner of the club and players should be like
เลสเตอร์ทั้งใจ🐕🏆🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭
I am a Manchester United fan...and this really got me emotional too.....well done Leicester team and especially Kasper to encourage him on the field for this .....
As a Liverpool fan, I admire The Foxes and its owner since they won EPL 2015/2016. I really hope both Liverpool & Leicester City will secure their spots for UCL next season 💪
Pretty sure Leicester city players will get big bonus as well for this
โลกทั้งใบให้เลสเตอร์ครึ่งหนึ่ง
ดีใจด้วยค่ะ❤💛🇹🇭🇹🇭  congratulations 👏🙌🎉🎉
I'm so jealous damn... whose cutting those damn onions?! Wish some of the other owners were like him...
Congratulations 🎉🎉👏
Lester, my congratulations! Every member of team played selflessly! Great!
If only Manchester United had owners like this. Congratulations Leicester City 🎊🎊 A very well deserved win
That's is  a true love of football ❤️❤️❤️
This is so touching and beautiful.
The difference between MANU and LEI
And then we have Kronke 😣
Watching this I feel like football won today. Beautiful!!❤️❤️
Top is the Ambassador of Quan
As an United fans,Leicester is touching in my heart.keeping smile when I watching
Wow
ยินดีด้วยครับ
love it!!!!
Hendo shuffle. Well done Leicester from Liverpool supporter. Awesome 🤩 to see fans there and what a sublime goal.
Congratulations Leicester.
Imagine MU have owner like him
He looks very much like his father. <3
M a chelsea fan I was frustrated with the result and this moment came...then I knew why Leicester deserved to win... Such a wonderfull club..respect and love from Chelsea 💙forever blue💙
This ting had me tear man WTH 😂😭
Glazzers cant relate
This is heartwarming
Congrats Leicester nd am more excited to see Snr man Iheanacho wit the Nigeria flag
It's a beautiful game
Huge admiration for Leicester City from a real madrid fan in central America!!✌🌎💖
Then there are owners like Stan kroenke
It's all about Leicester City FC, nice try BT Sport but when it came to choosing BBC or BT Sport for FA Cup - no competition. Feature with Gary Linekar on the street where he was raised and his reaction was epic! Memorable! 💙 Congratulations Leicester, relationship between Top and players is rare. What a keeper Schmeical is - Kasper that is😂
Dislikes are from the initiators of the superleague booo hoooo
Leicester City - This club is growing bigger and better ❤️
As Man Utd fan, i wish many success to Leicester in many years to come. The owner are absolutely amazing
Reminds me of when spurs beat ajax. Poch levy the fans the players loving life. Now we're jealous.
That is why the owners are needed
Leicester always have good celebrations.
Hope Rodgers comes to Tottenham but will be happy if he stays also
Truly a wonderful moment, why can’t arsenal have an owner like this?
Football is a Very Beutifull
send this vdo for Glazers.
I never saw this kind of relationship between a club and a chairman or a owner.
Amazing, as a non-leicester fan, I can say this is a proper club. Real happy how everybody from the top till bottom is closely knit together. And the message "if we have the courage to pursue them, our dreams can come true" really resonated
At 0:14, do I really see Claudio Ranieri or not
im a liverpool fan .. but im just loving these scenes . joy💙💙💙
Can’t see the European super league club owners being involved or interested like this well done Leicester
united fans will never feel this 😂
This is the only reason why I didn’t want Chelsea to win. I don’t hate Chelsea but this one was for football.
ฤดูกาลหน้าคุณจะเห็นเลสเตอร์ยิ่งใหญ่กว่านี้
Leicester owner just did a Patrice Motsepe
🥲🥲🥲🥲
As an Arsenal fan, envy is to light of word seeing this chairman.
he is a true owner coz he owns his teams respect and love..
I have never seen an owner celebrate with the players like that. In contrast to Man U, LFC, Chelse, Spurs and Arsenal this is quite refreshing
This what football means to everyone. Its more than just a game
Beautifull relationship in football
❤️
now this is a proper football club owner
What an expression
fan's club.
As a Chelsea fan n human being . Congrats Leicester Chelsea will win Champions league City the premier league cup All happy  Lets end this Trophy drought. I wish Arsenal could have won EUROPA cup
How can somebody dislike this video... Such a heartwarming moment..
As an arsenal fan, I admire Leicester with their owner right now 👏🏿😀.  Absent club owners should be kicked out of English football
It seems like he actually knows the players, Mr Ashley take note
Everybody loves Ngolo Kante Everybody loves Rihanna Everybody loves Leicester City FC
สุดยอดมากครับ🇹🇭🇹🇭
How's the song go? What does the Fox say 🎉🎉🎉🤣
I am so jealous right now... What a club... Players , owners and manager on the same page... A big shame to those clubs who were interested in breakaway league.
The ball already hit the hand of ayozu before he passed to tielemans
I hope this agnelli dude is watching this. This is what football is meant to be.
Another fairytake victory by Leicester congrats to them. Too bad pages like espn fc or sky sports never gave them the coverage and credit for reaching the final
Chelsea was being robbed
This is what a football club owner should be like. True passion and love for the sport.
This should honestly be on one of those “This is Football” emotional videos... big congratulations to Leicester!
Leicester is a role model for how Premier League clubs SHOULD be run. Other PL clubs take note and learn from this. Absolutely delighted for the fans, the club, and the owner 🙏 (sawadikub).  From a lifelong Liverpool fan 🏆🦊
His father would've been proud of him!
จัดไปๆๆๆๆๆ
this is an owner who really cares about the sport not just the money. he takes the time to be with the players and celebrate with them 💙 just a joy to watch
Hence they call it 'The Beautiful Game' ❤️
I wish Manutius have owners like leister top top man
Fully deserved! One of beautiful moment in football history.
Every owner should be like this... That give energy 🍺🍺
As a Chelsea fan I am sad.... but on the other hand very happy to see Leicester city lift the fa cup trophy...a team with such togetherness from top to bottom...everyone's second favorite team.
Daniel Ek can celebrate with Arsenal just like this when they win a... oh, never mind.
Lovely scene ❤
Congratulation from indonesia
This is lovely
Foxes never quit
kapkumkap
Respect 💯❤️
Stupid goal handball first.
The best owner ever ❤️
If it was the glazers, theyd be dead.
Awesome
The dirty half dozen take note
นี่แหละคนไทย ทีมคือครอบครัวค่ะ ❤️❤️❤️
Chelsea are a great team but we should give credit to Leicester where it’s due wonderful team with sensational players and a great manager and tielemans what a player congratulations Leicester city
Best chairman from Thailand
Respect to Leicester from Arsenal.
not a leicester fan but VICHAI WILL BE PROUD OF THIS HISTORICAL ACHIEVEMENT DONE BY BRENDAN AND THE TEAM
Special
Leicester City Family Club
This is the best moment with chairman
The chilwell goal was disallowed by the controversial VAR but well deserved foxes
What a respectful moment! The players, the manager, and all staffs showed a deep respect and appreciation to the president! It's because the president is so humble and thinks my players are my assets
I didn't even expect chelsea to win any titles they reached the champions league final because they were lucky that real Madrid was not at its best
Who cut onion in front of me? Im not crying..... 😭
I want them to beat Arsenal in the Champions league final this owners deserved so much love from football fans 😭✋
Everyone lost ....shamed the fa cup by kneeling to Marxist anarchists
A chelsea fan and Leicester are just an incredible club.
Next stop....Winners of the Champions League
After seeing this....Leicester has officially become my second favourite club...I hope the owner here gathers some cash and bids to buy Manchester United
Forever Leicester city
Let the Glazers see this
Respect
haha u can tell he's more than just a businessman, he's a pure football fan just like many of us. love from liverpool
Wow get in, happy for yous
Sawatikup, Vichai!!!
Laporte And this man passion
From tragedy to triumph, I am so happy for Leicester City, the People's Club.
This is so special! Leicester is becoming a special club.
ร้องไห้เลยครับ
Congratulations Leicester city for the champion 🏆 with love from Thailand 🇹🇭
THIS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IS WHY THERE WILL NEVER BE ENGLISH TEAMS IN A "SUPER" LEAGUE...
Proud

🇹🇭🇹🇭คนไทยไม่เเพ้ชาติใดในโลก💗💗
What did he do? He never spend much money to buy player
This is so inspirational and emotional. Football is all about these moments with fans, owners and players connected.
This Is The Way .
Can this guy buy Man Utd as well?
ยินดีด้วยน้ะคับคุณต้อป...ถ้าคุณวิชัยยังอยู่คงภูมิใจในตัวคุณมากๆ...ทุกคนต้องรวมกันเป็นหนึ่ง..ตั้งเเต่นักเเตะโค้ชเเละเจ้าของสโมสร..วันนี้คุณวิชัยคงมองลงมา..ร่วมฉลองเเชมป์คงยืนยิ้มเเละปรบมือเหมือนที่เคยทำ💓🎉🎊
hope united would do the same to glazers if they won europa league
Glazers family : what is that ?
Rio be like : Ay yo glazers man better take note or leave!
Congratulations!!! From a real Arsenal fan!!!!
Good owners, like Villas. Maybe the “BiG SiX” owners should take note.
สุดยอดเลยครับ👍👍👍🙏🙏🙏
Nothing but love ❤️
Respect to King Power Groups that brings history to the Leicester City FC, last time The Premier League and now FA cup !!!
real life master leauge team lol
Imagine Glazers doing this with MU players and staff🤣
The only chairman all England fans want on the big clubs.
They kind of owner Arsenal needs
I just feel happy for them.. Chelsea fan ☺
beautiful <3
Beautiful from the woner..beautiful scenes.. just love the whole thing..God is great. God is kind. May God have mercy upon us.
FIRST TROFI BRENDAN ROGERS
คุณวิชัยเคยแล้วไว้ว่าจะซื้อทีมฟุตบอลเพื่อเอามาแข่งกับเชลซี วันนี้คุณทำสำเร็จแล้ว
Super happy for Leicester
ข้าคือคนไทย "หัวใจจิ้งจอก"
Leicester has something that Chelsea lack of. The passion for the club and the hunger to win the game.
Even I'm not a Leicester fan but as I am Thai, I'm so proud of this club. Leicester City under Srivadhanaprabha family has been making history. What's next can't wait to see. 👍🇹🇭🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿👍 Leicester City U23 is also doing well with the Thai player.
That's the power of football
All football clubs should be like this, as an Arsenal fan Leicester is showing the best example of beauty of football. The way the club unites the fans, owner, manager, coaches and players is incredible. This is how football should be and not be ruined by ownership of clubs due to greed
I just cannot believe Leicester's luck Both father and son are so loved by the fans and they love the fans dearly While at Arsenal, we are stuck with a garbage owner with absolutely no ambition whatsoever
And then, we have the GLAZERS.
Well,well deserved
I am happy for the two Nigerians because they my people
Best owner good chairman not club it is Lester city family
Laporta has done this already ...
in EPL only Abramovich and Vinchai really love their club
United fan, well done Leicester
So, not a waste when I'm coming to watch football soccer again and pick Leicester as my favorite team this early season. I chose Leicester because they won EPL 2015/2016 as underdog. So, they are really special. Fox always fox. 💪🏼
As an arsenal fan. Im so in ❤️ with the Leicester owner how proud his father  would have been right now. He is so down to Earth and to celebrate the cup with all the Players just shows his pure class act. A lesson for other owners as well. Learn from him he just showed what Football is all about.
Great respect to the owner who shows us all about his love to the club
Congratulations Leicester City..👍👍🙏🙏
I’m a Chelsea fan but I’m almost more happy to see Leicester win it than us. Props to them 👏🏻
If the club have an owner, they need an owner like this one. With passion, love, and spirirlt for the club. Not the one who splash all the money or 'stole' the money from the club.
I am very proud of the Thai Toy Club because I am Thai. ❤️❤️✌️
We are thailand!
Not a Leicester fan… but I am happy they won it
I am a Chelsea Fan but I don’t know why seeing Leicester winning this match didn’t make me sad. I was all smiles even though my club lost. Had it been city or united or Liverpool i would have been absolutely gutted. Happy for Leicester city FC and their fans.  We will beat City to win Champions League. 🤞😀
Wholesome 🤧
leicester’s board is way better than arsenal’s, that’s ironically sad
special moments, special bond with the players and staff.
I’m not sure if I’m weird. But I just cried a little.
Hope this motivates Daniel ek to buy Arsenal
Role model owner of football clubs
I'm a Chelsea fan but I can't hate or even dislike Leicester.
That man city owner would never do such things
I am a Chelsea fan always but believe me Leicester win and these feelings give me chills. Happy within👍️👍️🙂🙂
Why does this loss hurts so much 😭 The only light is we lost to an honourable team like Leicester City. Congratulations👏💔
This is how club owners should be.... 👏 Kroenke-watch and learn
0:47 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
😀😃😃👍👍👍💯
I would be absolutely mad if we lost this against the big six, but this leicester tho.. it's just proved that something went wrong with our "full stars" squad
🇹🇭🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🏆
No Goal Hand ball Leicester City
Congrat leiscester city big winnn😍😍😍😍 i see only this club respect the owner they celebrate together woowww i dont have any word for this big winn i can only wish good hrd work good team work next seasson
I think kun has robbed money from roman Abramovich unknowingly to make chilwell goal offside
Congrats 🎈🎉🎊🍾
“Credit where credit is due” Well deserved win..Leicester should be a top 6 club instead of Tottenham or Arsenal tbh
Leicester สุดยอด!!!!!
Leicester is the best.
Ok let's skip the emotional moment, did Chelsea just lost FA cup final again ? 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
Congratulation  leicester
สุดยอดโว้ย
Leicester city fans,owners, managers and players Having good relationship Manchester United fans:glazers out
That’s the love towards real football! 👏🏻  Hardly see owner celebrating with players! Hate for Super League which destroys football 🤮
Thai people go crazy 😁😁🇹🇭🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🎊⚽🥅🥇
"Connected from top to bottom"
free free palestine❤️❤️❤️🇯🇴🇮🇩
I' m MU fans, i think glazer can't celebrate win trophy like leicester man. Congrat to Leicester for the game n the trophy.
20yra liverpool,  i support rogers as a mgr and his team,  leicester city much (much impressive in performance even dunt invest a lot of $$$$
Couldnt find a single reason not to love Leicester City F.C.  They are everyones dream !!!!
Congratulation to Leister City&Khun Top, from yours FC.
Gdansk 26.may  Glazers: *Congratulations on winning the Champions League*  Ole: *No, no, Europa League*  Glazers: *What? But we were in the Champions League*  Ole: *Yeah, but...never mind.*
Not our day, anyway congrats 👍👍👍👍
Meanwhile the owner of a "big 6" club once sat in the stand and asked which colour their team was wearing...
But why he sacked ranieri?
Dayum i am crying
Beautiful
I want that GLAZER WAS THE SAME FOR MAN UNT instead of stealing money
Absolutely beautiful to see!!
This is actual football owner happy for them
Congratulation Leicester👍
This is the best club  president from Thailand 🇹🇭💖
Contrary to Another Asian Singaporian who destroyed Valencia to ashes.   Told fans to fk off and Remind them he is owner and he can use the club for profit.  Absolutely respect to LC owner for not giving the Asians a bad name but Rather   Increase the Respect.
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇨🇷🇨🇷
Wish united had this guy..
Manu united fan and i think that's the way it should be .
Proud to be half Thai
The most beautiful things seen in football nowadays
Just love the togetherness of LFC...lots of owners don't even know players in their team but seeing this club makes me love football even more...a true victory for football ⚽⚽..may all the owners be like them🙏🙏
Congratulations Leicester City
Congratulations to Leicester City....As Arsenal Fan, I'm jealous of the close relationship between owners, management staffs, players and specially fans... I wish Arsenal had similar relationship in our club....
Wished our owner was like this..  Arsenal fan
this is so beautiful i couldnt stop watching it
I don't mind losing this one looking at that smile of passion and love for the club🥰
LCFC - A club with 0 rival fans ... take a bow!
And manu fan just wish that their owner drop dead
goosebumps
In few years or so people will definitely  kicking themselves in regret of missing the opportunity to buy and invest in crypto currency, believe  me when it comes to crypto   currency trading Mr Jayden mason is the best, I lost £1200 carelessly trading on a platform then I was referred to mr Jayden mason he recovered the loss and made an extra profit of £4600,since then he had  been managing my trade for months and I keep making profits every week , made $9,130 last week
The Big Six Owners should feel ashamed
That will never be Stan Kroenke ...
Very cool 🤙🏼. Togetherness....even with the owner.
This win is not for fa Cup, its a slap to other super league clubs that football should not always have privilege.
asian owners do it differently 🤩
Beautiful beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is beautiful, do they have enough money to buy arsenal too
As an Arsenal fan, I am so jealous not because of the FA Cup title, but the bonding between coach, players and the owners...
Now that is a man that cares about his family.
best owner in the world, and they are Thais. I couldn't be more proud :)
I am a Liverpool fan. But, at least for a day today, I am a Liverpool fan and also a Leicester fan! I love the facts that the owner Leicester loves the club, players, and fans so much, and that he is so loved by the club, players, and the fans so much! What a joy to watch!
Well done to Leicester. As an LFC fan, I'm particularly happy for BR. Brilliant job guys.
Because football is Asia’s favourite game. Football is almost every Asian country’s official national sport.
เเจ๋ว
As a man utd fan I'm jealous of leicester
ดีใจกับพี่ต๊อปด้วยครับ😄😄😄😄 is Championss🎉🎉🎉
ซึ้งว่ะ
Damn im arsenal fun jelous look this
Beauuuuuuuuuutiful moment. Amazing.
A Club with decent overseas owners. Ones that have invested without being all about money, and have actually enhanced and moved the club on within its own identity... Congrats Guys.....
Wow this is so special..this is what football is all about!!👊
Which are the players that will be bought and leave..just like 2016
Pemain indo kapan ya hahaha
I'm in tears mehn 😭
Mrs Rose Robert and her method works like magic I keep earning single week with new strategy
Congrats to Leicester City and Khun Aiyawatt. Khun Vichai must be proud.
Man Utd and Arsenal fans will be hell jealous tho
Se lo merece vamos a celebrar
They have gone beyond the limit of one club.  They are like a real family. Khun Top's love for Leicester is immeasurable
His father, The Premier League Champion, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha used to sponsorship with the Chelsea but his family got kicked out of the vip by a staff. So his promise to himself to own a club just to compete the Chelsea. The great king-power.
WOW 😲
Imagine buying a club to not support it.
Passion over money
well done, good business, good owner, Khun Vichhai...
Congratulations To Leicester City.
So happy for Leicester City and everyone that is associated with the club, that club is a family and they care, shame my club Arsenal is a shambles of a club, one day I hope we can be a club I can trust and believe in. Well done Leicester 👏 🏆
The success of Leicester City winning the FA Cup in 2021 is dedicated to Khun Top Srivaddhanapraba, The younger brother of the late Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. I as a Chelsea fan who dares to accept defeat congratulate Leicester City on winning this tournament. What such a wonderful journey for the fox. Best regards from Chelsea fans in Indonesia.
This is sooooo refreshing man😌 And then we had Bartomeo 🤣🤣🤣
As chelsea fan, of course i feel sad. But i just can't hate leicester, congrats for the win. Well deserved to the owner 👌 remind me of how happy abramovich back in 2012
Joel glazier I hope your watching this?? This is how owners should be it should mean as much to them as it does to players n fans alike
Hahhaa...gilo chairman pon
As Newcastle supporters, i wish Newcastle got this Owner to Run beloved Club. What an amazing Character and very kind Owner.
Big respect for the team
This made me emotional 😭
Lại môi thằng đc thưởng 1 siêu xe rồi
His father paved the way
Chelsea robbed!
썸네일 보고 왜 윤계상이 있나 했네
That we call a chairman... Not like chairman Manchester United 😒😒😒😒😒
Glazer wont do that in million years
Touching
Still a better celebration than City's win
Wonderful. Arsenal Owners has a lot to learn f
Leicester great team...PSG fan
No wonder Leicester player are so loyal to the club 😍
And then there are Glazers 🤦‍♂️ What sin did we ever commit !
Leicester Won As A FAMILY🥰🥰
This is Absolutely beautiful moment
I was going for Chelsea, but after seeing these images I m very happy for Leicester. Classy of Schmeichel to give trophy to the owner.
can u guys imagine kroenke face ? 😅
Var
Tbh this is the role model we need 🙏👍
Love this so much
No other club owner would have done this. This is what makes Leicester so special and so loved, the owner literally and directly connects with the players and the fans. Any way Congrats for the win once again.
Respect for Leicester. From A gooner!
Down to earth owner's club
KING POWER!
How can anyone not be happy for this club? What a great scene!
Congratulation to Leicester... first time FA Cup Winner! (*_*) Also to Khun Top... His father would be proud up there in Heaven.
i wish glazer were like this with man utd.
Incredible ❤️
Love this!!!...
Leicester deserves a spot in our hearts and Champions League as well
I am not even Leicester fan but i am happy for them.
Im so glad they won, just from the scenes after. The owner deserved this and so did his father. Amazing. Respect to Leicester.
If there were fans 😥
As an Everton fan this is fantastic to see , well done to the foxes
As an Arsenal fan i am not in the slightest bit ashamed to admit that these scenes actually made me well up..   Huge respect for the ownership, the club, the club's philosophy, the football they play, Brednan Rodgers and his staff, and the fans.   Congratulations!!  The whole sport of football and every worldwide fan of the sport are all winners today 👏🏼
One of "the real big six" If u know what i meant 😁
Everyones second favourite club.
Dia siapa? Face oriental
They really had an incredible season. Congrats
Glazers watch and learn
Money don't buy trophies for Chelsea 🤣🤣 The underdogs Leicester city 😎😎 The talented team
Oh that's beautiful U need one who can celebrate with pride
Brendan is just so happy to find someone on his level.....

That's what football is all about guys ! What an emotional moment.  From AC Milan fan
Welldone Leicester inspiration for many clubs.
Lecistar city is more than a club 💙
Amazing team
masio uduk fans,,, seneng aku ndelok cuk,,
Amazing to see this. Ynwa
Stan Kronke need to see this
They seem to have genuine love for him. It’s very special.
Cant stop crying man 😅🍾🍻🦊💙
This is amazing that a club without billions to spend win against those teams
they needed this most
As a United fan, I can't help but be jealous of Leicester & their owners. If the Glazers try this with us right now, i'm sure there would be a riot on the pitch.
For Vichai! 🦊💙
❤❤❤❤
I'm not a Leicester fans. But, this scene was beautiful. ❤️
It's amazing! Awesome! The club owner joins the players to celebrate the victory ...
Arsenal need owner who love football like this.😭😭😭
I’m happy for Leicester, well deserved ❤️❤️❤️
Why are all/most clubs in the premier league owned by foreigners?
VERY HAPPY FOR LEICESTER. AND WOW THEY ALL ARE SO CONNECTED. AND CONGRATULATIONS TO THE BACKGROUND STAFFS AS WELL THAT GOAL WAS STUNNING AS HELL WISH US LUCK IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL FOR MAN CITY. AND SURELY AND INDIRECTLY LEICESTER CITY HELPED US WITH OUR WIN AT PREMIERE LEAGUE. THANKS.
Cant hate Leicester that’s what footballs all about
Wow, how good is this celebration? Never seen anything like that. Congratulations Leister fans!!!
As a Chelsea fan I’m ashamed to not get the win but happy to see that Leicester are enjoying it especially after the passing of Vichai.
The efficacious lock ganguly wriggle because degree proportionally drown pace a cheerful january. meek, disagreeable sail
The dad won the premier League and the son won the Fa cup with the team. How beautiful is that..
Congratulations to Leicester and what a goal to win it as well they’ve been so good all season deserved something and they’ve beat some good teams to get there as well good luck next season
he mite be a great owner, but as a person hes an idiot and corrupt businessman!
Delighted for Leicester and delighted for Chelsea
THAILAND PROUD🇹🇭🇹🇭
Man they have great chemistry between player,club,fans and owner. Now i know why mahrez so sad and emotional when vichai passed away even at the time he played for manchester city
Manchester united, take notice !
2022 wc:ur breath is counts offside
This is what a owner should be, not the glazers and kroenkes. We need more like Leicester
Good job Leicester city
I would bet my house that this chairman does not refer to anyone as 'legacy fans'.
Huhuh. Arsenal Jealous
I like Leicester and I like seeing them succeed, but this game was handed to them by the ref.
Palestine
If it was Man Utd or Liverpool owner, instead of hugs they gonna get eggs from the stands
Chelsea just bottled two Fa cup finals like it was a just coca cola cup
Khun Wichai's intention is true that "One day we will do a team to fight Chelsea," congratulations on Leicester's success as well.
Great team 👍
The owners really cares for his football team
Tielemans got so emotional there, the owners father would be so proud, I'm so happy for him
Rio throwing shades at the Glazers 😂
Salute & respect...eventhou kante & mahrez r out...team with remarkable fighting spirit...may this team cont creating history in football..
Amazing!!!!! From the top to the bottom that’s a class club!!!!! I’m villa but my Nan was Leicester born and bred. She’d have loved this. Big result for football!
Tahniah Seluruh Warga Leicester City 💪🏽👍🏻
Lovely to watch and congratulations to Leicester city
We as United fans need this sort of ownership
Oops they did it again !
สุดยอดครับ
As a united fans, i hope man utd has a great owner like him, the relationship between owner and Players it's just really wholesome
Seems like a nice guy but the money is still "well dodgy" - getting the exclusive duty free concession at the Bangkok airport, then every Thai airport, with no bidding involved - typical 3rd world graft ( of the kind that is becoming commonplace in the UK of course ). It's still part of the rotten world of questionable ill gotten gain in which football is completely immersed.  No doubt he is a better owner than Kroenke or the Glazers but this is in part because he has made his dodgy fortune elsewhere and isn't looking to use Leciester as his personal piggy bank. Behind every club with money there's a crook.
Congratulations Leicester FC!!!👏👏👏
Congrats  “ Leicester City 🥇🏆🏆
Absolutely class thats what football should be about
Truely wonderful, Congratulations Leicester!!!!
🦊🏆💙
Such a show, such a drama. In the real world Chelsea would have won, but for media and crowd the story is needed. Now Chelsea will win Champions League final
The best owner a football club could ever have
And look and united with the owner
Im Man Utd fan’s, but hardly i have to admit that i being jealous to see Leicester Owner’s paying special gestures to all of them.. which is i think Man Utd couldn’t reach this kind of treatments from the Owner nor Woodward/Father of The Football will giving same things..😭
Not about a business, but a glory, class!!
With this trophy now, they should really be bacKhun Top
Such a good moment
Dangote for Arsenal.
Leicester owner showing the other premier league parasites what football is about
I'm so jealous. Can spurs borrow the trophy?
Champion league next season
As a Chelsea fan all I can say is well done to Leicester ! Their journey and their conduct in these recent years has been nothing short of inspirational 🍻
That's why Vardy is still in this club
He is the best club owner I have seen interacting celebrabting with players and staff ....fantastic
and then there are clubs like Manchester United who are dissatisfied with their owners.. Its amazing to see Leicester win this!!
Liverpool in my soul. Leicester in my blood. Congratulations from Thailand.
Leicester deserved this
Warm winning for football fans, even i'm supporter from chelsea fc❤️
As a chelsea fan, i hope the ziyech fan boyz will quiet down!  Let the manager do his job! Our fans are a shame...they were cricket at the stadium. Just old heads n crack heads smh
Kroenke . Glazer . Roman & Mansor . U guys should learn something🤣
it gets kinda emotional to watch this
Happy we did it🔵 feels like we play too even tho we just watch with excitement 💪🏼
ผม..ชอบ..ตอนที่..ยกมือไหว้..คับ....เพราะ...วัฒนธรรมไทย...ใคร..แก่กว่า...เราต้อง...ให้ความเคารพเขาคับ....
Congrats Leicester City! Well Deserved FA cup winners
Leicester city defined that Football is for everyone
congrats foxes 🤙🏼🤙🏼
GLAZERS learn from this
Glazer Would Never.
Yeah~~~~~~~!!!
Dude continues his father legacy.
Class Act!
คุณดีใจกัน...ไม่ต่างกับคนไทยเหมือนกันครับ Champion FA Cup 🏆🇹🇭
Highest transfer paid for a single player at 45m euros for youri. 87m and 67m received for Harry Maguire and Mahrez. Still managed to win a league title and FA cup. What a club! Congratulations 🥳
As a fan of football, a liverpool fan. As native Thai, I am proud of this man. The man that will follow his his father's legacy. This is what the 'big six' needs. Owners who are willing to listen to fans, managers and players. And not make it about them. Congratulations Leicester city, your FA cup champions. And a well deserve trophy to the collection. Full respect to the owner, board, manager, staff and the players. Incredible job.👏💪
God i wish, my club owner would back the team and celebrate like this🙏, well done to Leicester city 👏
I'm feeling so envious right now. I think I'm falling in love with Leicester too 😅 and, yes I am an Arsenal fan😂
Oh man this is so beautiful
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
None of the players wanted to take the trophy back off him after he lifted it and quite right. So much respect to the owners.
Nice
I’m Manchester United fan and our club owner just invested money to make more money. He doesn’t care about fans and players feelings. Look at that guy, he is insane and I would say that’s called football. Anyway congratulation to the Leicester fans and entire team.
How to run a football club ft. Khun Top. Classs
This is so so special
U deserve it respect from Chelsea fan🙏
Simply amazing ❤️
This bring tears to men hahaha
What Leceister city football club has produced in the last 5-6 years has been just simply magnificent. If any team deserves a documentary series, it has got to be Leicester City FC.  From winning the 5000/1 title, the story of Jamie Vardy's rise. Selling players like Mahrez, Maguire, Kante and yet still having a team capable of challenging in Europe. Losing their team owner in a devastating crash, that happened next to the football, and yet their resilience showed by the whole Leicester team from the top to the bottom, has been truly wonderful. What his son carried on from his dad on building this football club and connecting with the fans around, has to be something every other football club ( mainly the so-called top 6) should be jealous of. Even the work Brendan Rodgers has done to this team, as much as I enjoyed Liverpool's collapse during their title race in 2014, I am happy for him, went away to Scotland, increased his stock price, came back to England, took over a solid team, and made it more consistent. Although they fell off last season from the UCL spot, I do hope they do play in UCL next season. Even big shout out to Hamza Choudhary for representing south Asians and being the first player of that descent to win the FA Cup <3  Overall, Leceister city made us all love football again, and they continue to show us what proper ownership can do for a football club.
I'm a liverpool fan but leicester is the true embodiment of a football family, the people's club. Respect 👍
Wow it’s amazing win
Im looking forward to Stan Kroenke lifting the Arsenal trophy in 1,2,3 or 4 years..     :-(
Arsenal should to sell to ASIAN Owners, not White Male Owners. It's time Asia takes the lead, the West is a joke, especially American white male owners. Kroneke pls pass on.
Owner - Players - Fans connected ❤  Arsenal and United Fans can't relate 🤣🤣
Leicester is really great team work &their chairman ภูมิใจมากๆค่ะ และยินดีด้วยกับความสำเร็จค่ะ⚽️💖💟
Big respect from an Arsenal fan, Leicester deserve this and good to get hyped from an amazing performance from Leicester, also to have an owner like that it’s amazing
Beautiful atmosphere
WHOLESOME AS F**K
this is the most beautiful moment in football for some time ♥️
พวกคุณสุดยอดมากๆๆ
I envy this football club of being one from top to bottom. Great victory and well deserved
Every team owner should learn this  from leicester city boss.
Am an ardent Man United fan and to see the Leicester owner celebrating with the players, I can never imagine that happening at Old Trafford. The way he looked up at the sky, thinking of his father, got me teary eyed. The whole club seems to be together and today, is a win for Football. HUGE CONGRATULATIONS TO LEICESTER CITY. :)
210 people are bots paid for by the Glazers
Manchester united Fans Can't relate 🤣
Manchester city here but that is beautiful respect from the chairman
This explains the protests that happened outside Old Trafford last week. This is exactly what the fans want and Manchester United is not even close to Leicester City in terms of how the club is run.  Maybe now the people criticising the protest will understand why it really happened.
Must be nice to have owners that turn up to games and love the club
aww soe good 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🇹🇭
now i see why leicester player like jamie vardy wont leave the club
This Family is what every football fan dreams their owner would be like
Blessed club. Win for football, win for the sport.   American owners, take notes
This owner we wish all super club have
As a chelsea fan. I think this relationship beautiful. Congrats the foxes 💙
Was that the famous dion dublin from homes under the hammer??
PL big six 6 can buy any player but they can’t buy this owner
I salute this victory. He brought warmth and win to the big leister family
i WISH arsenal had owners like this
Respect!
Quite a contrast at Old Trafford...
I am in tear, it so touching moment.
where are the glazers? laughing to the bank?
🔥🔥👍👍
Yes my upmost respect to this club. That's what a football club should be. 👏👏👏👏👏... Salute
I am a Chelsie fan but seeing how much they wanted it tells me the right team won. Well DONE 👍
As a United supporter I am so unbelievably envious of Leicester City in terms of how they're run and the relationship the owners have with the club as a whole.
Respect perfectt🔥🔥🔥
สุดยอดไปเลยครับท่าน อยากเห็นนักเตะไทยไปชูถ้วยแชมป์ด้วยจะสุดยอดมากๆเลย
Big respect to Leicester! Awesome to see how a football club should be run compared to billionaire owners who couldn’t care less
Can u imagine the glazers be embraced by their own players this way? 😅😜
they need to chill. they still need to make champions league.
As an arsenal fan - this is beautiful.  This is respect and I think as Rio mentioned I have never seen an owner come down to celebrate with players. Wooowow.

*I have never seen a club connected from top to bottom*- rightly said by the commentator
Respect from the blues
The 207  dislikes are from Chelsea fans
u guys should try n find out the story behind the name King Power......it has a very interesting story how Khun Vichai (🙏🏻) got that name.....😌 this is for u, Khun-Vichai...
Chairman Khun will definitely dedicated this win to his late father who died in the helicopter crash couple of years ago!
now i m fan of L :)))
Браво Лестер 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊
Thanks to that Chelsea guard who almost hit Vichai's chin. Now he bought the club and beat Chelsea finally..
I envy Leicester as an arsenal fan
Well done Leicester, great to see owners who care about their club
I’m a Chelsea fan, definitely gutted about the lose. But that’s football, nothing’s certain or guaranteed.  Seeing this beautiful moment, brought tears to my eyes. Really amazing and touching moment. Congratulations Leicester City FC and the fans! Enjoy this moment! 👍🏼
As an Arsenal fan, I'm jealous that there's that kind of connection with the owner. With a heavy loss, he has gained a large number to his family.
This made me smile , what an achievement! Deserved winners
Football has won.
And world says Asian don't love this game, if Asian were to fund clubs this is what you'd see, but love for Leicester went to moon for me, I'm a City fan though.✌️
1:27 Daniel Ek try to blend in as a photographer and see what is it like to be an Arsenal owner one day
And there is the vulture Kroenkes
my 2nd favourite club from the prem by a country mile✨
I m Thai so proud with him and his dad
One of the most Loved and humble owner (Lecester City) the Premier League has. He is so down to Earth.   Had his father(Vichai) been alive, he must be very proud seeing his Club lifting this precious Trophy after so many years. Shout out to Licester City for winning this Trophy.
Khun Vichai is smiling in the heaven.🦊😊👋💯
I find some of there comments rude. Leeds owners are like that also.
I wish arsenal had a owner like this family, they love the club , the players
THIS IS AN OWNER!
I'm now a fan of Leicester
Well done Leicester City. Such a well run club. Congrats!
Respect and congrats to Leicester! U guys did great! From a Liverpool fan..
That gesture 0:59 🥺🥺🥺
now itz time for Chelsea to win the champion league dats how i predicted ,mancity pl n c.cup..
Continuing his dad's legacy
Massive respect for the owners of leicester city 😘😘
คนไทยไม่แพ้ชาติใดในโลก 🇹🇭
It's not just the owner . Leicester's team may not be as technically gifted as many of the so calked ESL teams. But they play with their heart for their club and fans , unlike the prima donnas in the bigger team who are only in it for themselves. As a man United fan , can't help thinking what a really great player Pogba would be if he were to really play with desire to make the fans  proud.
Within a few years Leicester will win the champions league... I wouldn't put it past them.fa cup.prem title.and consistently up the top of the table
Spurs fan-  I honestly didn't shed a tear I swear I didn't!  What an owner and just look at the genuine love between them all! Respect and huge congratulations to Leicester City FC.
Top club what a club should be like and ideal owners happy
Give ur players huge bonus...
I'm a Utd fan-could not be happier for Leicester. No bitterness at all in losing to them and these scenes are just so incredible. This is the kind of stuff that football and just life in general needs.
This is so touching
RIP for his father, He is making history for LCFC 👏
0:01 슈마이헬 사회생활 가동 중..
this is for Khun Vichai..🙏🏻🤝😌
Mengharukan
It sounds corny, but having a family connection with your team and managers is important. They are all people working together, not wealthy robots
So wholesome❤️
leicester probly won't ever have the same amount of silverware as these top 4 teams but every silverware they get after climbing from the very bottom feels that much more sweeter. congrats to LCFC & their fans
This is what a true owner looks like! The love and respect he gets is amazing just shows how much work he and his father (R.I.P) have put in.
Leicester city >> Tottenham Hotspur and Kane !! 😂
Look at how the owner looked to be loved by all players. They all look like a family to me. I hope, MANUTD can have this kind of owner
I love licester city❤️
So proud of Leicester
let’s celebrate with kathoeys
This club or family is a great sight from a boss
Beautiful
that energy🔥
คิดถึงคุณวิชัย  ขอบคุณทุกคนที่ทำให้สโมสรนี้เป็นเหมือนครอบครัว  ดูแล้วรู้สึกอบอุ่น  เป็นมากกว่าฟุตบอล  เลสเตอร์สู้สู้
I love the club...The owner adores the manager and the club and give him the transfer he need within the capacity....
Kroenke could never... 🤦🏾‍♂️
Arsenal fans were we at? 😪😪
I truly can’t understand an owner of a team not being there every week they’re available and cheering passionately for their team. I think it would be awesome. But then I’m not a billionaire either so I don’t know.
this is no club..this is one big "Family"..dream that all players wish for...congrats to Fox ...😎🍺🍺🍺👍👍👍🏆
Tak kaya takpe tapi cukup menjaga hubungan sesama management staff dan player. Ni pun dh cukup menyenangkan bagi sesebuah kelab. Itu lah kunci untuk someone stay dekat sesebuah kelab. Leicester salah contoh dan aku nampak man city. Even org kata oil money bagai tapi bagi aku management mek siti sgt okay. Hope jadi ikutan kepada kelab2 lain
Football:1 SuperLeague:0
KROENKE OUT
Though I am a City fan, I give my best respect to the owner.
Congrats to Leicester City from Dortmund. Well done!!!
The best football owners in the world , LCFC deserves this champion
Great news. Not a Leicester fan but damn this brings so much pleasure to watch. At the end of the day, we're all fans of the sport. ❤️ Congratulations Leicester!
Congrats to the foxes
Gooo foxeeeesssss gooo soyunzu Goo tielemansss
I think we’d all love a boss like Top
Saludos desde Chile gritando campeón Leicester
The Premier League title, European Football, the Helicopter Accident, Coronavirus and the FA Cup, to go through that, and come out on top of it all. That. That is what a football community should be like. From Ball Boy to Chairman. From Harrogate Town to Man City. Everyone can learn something if they watch the togetherness of Leicester City Football Club. They are a role model.
Damn, this ninja cutting union
As a Willem II Tilburg supporter, good job Leicester! We never won the FA cup nor did we ever got an invitation.
Covid: I'll give the lads a rest today. Today is a historic day not to be dampen by me, infecting others. I'll head somewhere else. Only for today, aye.
His late father actually passed at the stadium they're as much Leicester fans as anyone. Much respect. Much much envy from a MU fan
Like Bulldog says. 'who's the winner?... Football's the winner' 🥇 🏆
Respect to everyone envolved with Leicester City. Think every football club would want owners like them
No.1
Goodjob
this is a beautiful moment and it proves that's owners can still love the beautiful game and as a Chelsea fan I'm Disappointed at the result but fair play to Leicester it's was well deserved and congrats lads on winning your first fa cup ever
Another history written.. This can be a great plot for movie..
As a Liverpool fan, I'm happy for Brendan Rodgers. Congratulations!
sial la asal aku menangis sial hahah
Hello i am a Liverpool fan i am so happy to see Leicester won the FA cup. Congratulations to Leicester and all Leicester fans. U guys deserves the victory.
so happy for Leicester fans!  wish Arsenal owners were like this.....shame on Arsenal's previous shareholders for selling out to kronkes
Not the president, not the team owner But this moment is friends.  Respect Boss Vivat and Boss Vichai.
Well deserved man it’s first trophy in the FA Cup and they won the Prem in 2016 just beautiful
Glazers should be embarrased!
This is Why We love The Game! Congratulations Leicester from an LFC fan!
Great owners.
i hope he will buy arsenal from kronke
Woow
Wish Man united had an owner like that
New top 6 congratulations the fox👍🏻
Look at that, th owner celebration together with Players and fans. Wow❤️🙏
สุดยอดมากครับ
Love this. Congratulations Leicester City!
Leicester City, everyone's second favourite club
192 dislikes are Chelsea fans
This is totally random but I've to say, I felt sorry for Tottenham Hotspur.
Respect!!! Leicester city From Thailand
He would have dressed differently had he known he would be jumping with a metal cup over his head
U can't get any better than that
Vishai (the chairman that passed) would have loved this man he would have been here u will forever be in our hearts bro
Meanwhile FSG : 👁️👄👁️
Go ahead the Fox  # FC from Thailand

Wonderful
Love the moment, from Hong Kong
As Man utd fans , for me it is fantastic! Salute Leicester
The scene that Glazers, Kroenke and Levy only could dream of.
This is sport
Another clueless comment from Rio there's not a club more connected from top to bottom? What about all the fan owned club in the lower leagues like Exeter City
Truly heartwarming! Well done Leicester! 🏆
Very inspiring..lot of respects to all associated with Leicester FC..great club and one big family❤️❤️
Beautiful
Great stuff Leicester big love from a Baggie ❤👍
kat Malaysia kalau celebrate macam ni, dah kena saman
Leicester city fc is not a just football club it’s a family. Very much different compared with other clubs and their owners.
Brendan Rogers really is a fantastic coach
Brought me to tears
I love football ♥️
Leicester City will forever be legends
Wonderful Scenes, They really have something special there... Well Done Leicester from a Fulham Fan
This family as owners should be considered as true perfect patterns for all others , Great respect to this family and to Leicester club .
one of the greatest moments in football
The meek shall inherit the earth ... and the FA Cup!
I'm a Chelsea fan, but I have to say Leicester deserved it. From the beginning LCFC were who I wanted to win it if Chelsea didn't.  Hell, maybe I'm a closeted Leicester fan. I'm already pissed at Chelsea for the super league bs
Fox best xi

ผมเป็นคนไทย ผมเป็นแฟนฟุตบอลลิเวอร์พูล แต่เลสเตอร์ซิตี้อยู่ในสายเลือดครับ🥰
What a feeling moment..this is what they play for a win🏆
This shows why Vardy rejected Arsenal for Leicester - the unity from backroom staff all the way to the owners
I have a two words joke.  Mike Ashley.
imagine United players doing that to Glazers.
Moments like this is why we told the greedy 'big 6' owners to shove their super league where the sun don't shine. Football is about the unexpected and allowing fans of all clubs at least be able to dream. This owner cares and his dad cared. This is more just business to them!!!
From a city fan ...beautiful,  well done Leicester.
Beautiful moment, but nobody talks about Roman Abramovic like this, and the investment and passion he’s put into Chelsea never gets mentioned. But that’s not the agenda is it. Media can’t stand Chelsea or Abramovic. They might as well have said his name the way they are going on they just don’t have the balls to.
Im a chelsea fan, but this match im happy Leicester win, a big blow to the super 6 ...
So happy for lesciter
leicester achieved something that super league cannot provide
ขนลุก
❤️
Lads invest in Leicester this team is a goldmine.
Well done Leicester shows how Americans are so out of touch with the game!
Wow
In few years or so people will definitely be kicking themselves in regret for missing the opportunity to buy and invest in cryptocurrency
As a United fan I can only dream of having owners like this
I hope our chairman khaldoon or txiki or ferran soriano celebrate with players, manager, staff and fans on the pitch if we win the champions league final..
That's why we love football ❤️
As Chelsea Fans i can't angry to them.  They deserve it 👍👍
I. Just. Can't. Hate. Leicester. City.
God bless Leicester! This is what football is all about!
This club is WORLD CLASS.
Look at this passionate owner. I am really envy💔 Lacking this at Arsenal😔
Very smart chairman
Huge Respect to Lei.  Everything about this signify the true color of our beautiful game at its best.  -Liverpool Fan.
Jealous wish other team had owner who actually cared for the team not just the money.
He will be looking down so proud! Congrats Leicester!
One of the most heartfelt moments in modern English football
Liverpool supporter here. Congratulations, Leicester City.
As a Chelsea fan fair play do Leicester, better team on the day In terms of opportunities
One of many reasons why I’m a Leicester fan
ผมรักทีมเลสเตอร์ ผมรักคนไทย
181 dislikes from the owner of other PL clubs like arsenal man united
I love var fa cup
So special to have such wonderful owners.  Wish Leicester many more future successes
I'm an Arsenal fan. Where was Kroenke last year when we won it?! Counting his money in his ranch (which is bigger than my home town)?! Seriously I see more of the Arsenal I fell in love with in this Leicester side than I do at the club itself. I'm beyond jealous because Leicester FC has something we don't - a heart and a soul.
Amazing
Big 6 this is called peoples club
Im chelsea fan , this is beautiful
Well done Leicester im a man city fan hopefully we should win the champions league cup final all the best
As a Chelsea fan, I’d rather have won. But if I’m going to lose to someone I’d rather it be Leicester. A great team, fans and owners. Happy for them and massive congrats.
I am so happy for them, really happy. What a great owner and club. I am so glad it is Leicester City who won it and not chelski.
This how an owners relationship should be with the club
Bos 🏆🏆🏆🎊🎉🎉👍💯
this brings a tear to a glass eye
I support Arsenal and this touched my heart I watched it on TV live and I couldn't believe my eyes 👀 👀 the owner is like a fan what a moment I wish our Owner was like this. This is what Football needs I had money on Leicester to win 4/1 odds £10 bet and they done it well played Leicester better team on the night and to the owner Ur a great man it was written for Leicester to do it today for the director after what happened to the director in the helicopter crash R.I.P and Leicester city what a great club lovely fans and great team chemistry this is coming from an Arsenal fan.
Wolves also have great owners, the chairman goes to every U23 and even womens games (home and away). But I think everyone has to recognise Leicester are the best run club in the Prem.
FANTASTIC
Supportive owner Like FSG. But not as Rich as FSG.
คนไทยสุดยอด
Love this
Absolutely thrilled for Leicester, Top, and his late father. Proper club run by proper owners. Much love and congratulations from this Arsenal fan. Hope this victory pushes Leicester on to qualify for the CL.   One thing I can say for sure, if Arsenal had won any silverware, we wouldn’t invite any of the Kroenkes on the pitch to celebrate with us.
better than Glazer family
Watching ESL teams lose any game is added entertainment every week now.
Beautiful
That some owner 👏👏👏👍
Leicester city's win is a tight slap to the super league.
Arsenal win this cup last year, and as far i remember, i didnt see kroenke celebrate on pitch with the players~

Even though I’m a United fan, I get chills from this
This team stands for everything we are against in esl, much love to Leicester for being an example of how football should be
ขนลุก​เรย​ ประทับ​ใจ
We’d be lucky if the kroenkes even knew we were playing let alone turn up to watch and the take part in the celebrations. Jesus that makes me jealous 😂😂
As a City fan, I love to see this. Not even that we’re playing Chelsea in a few weeks, but because of seeing the “small” clubs get those trophies!
I am a United fan but I can't help myself to be proud of Leicester city as a football club. They deserve all the respect they get and all the titles they win. Way to go Leicester. And what owner they have wonderful man with a wonderful soul that connects with the players and overall club. Wish we had owners like them.
man. I'm so jealous
His dad would be proud. He was there today watching 100%
United supporter this is amazing 💕🤪
Dislikes are from families of Glazers, Kronkes, Abrahamovics, Levis and Fenway people
This is honestly so beautiful to see; although it's so upsetting that Aiyawatt's lost his father, I can't stop smiling when watching this video knowing that their dreams are coming true because Leicester had the courage to pursue them, meaning Vichai didn't die in vain ; such a beautiful story 🙏🏾
Congratulations from a Chelsea Fan💛
Must say, I'm quit jealous of the hierarchy of LCFC. The board, the owners , the players give it all for the success. An owner like this puts the club for glory and not money. Big 6 owners have to change their mindset... REALLY. Coming from a Man Utd fan. Congrats Leicester 👏
So happy for them they gave us so much pleasure when they won the premiership and now they have the fa cup someone is surly watching over them.
The concept of buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off when the price rises just has the current market is down. Holding is profitable, although trading is far more profitable. I was to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough, but i was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyse the digital market , all that changed when i encountered Daniel Wright services. , although i have been into numerous services but Daniel Wright stands out with experience and expertise playing in his favour . I must confess it wasn't an easy task to learning the routes on trading but with the assistance of Daniel it was more easier to understand , Here are his details on Tel- gram ( @Danielwrightfx..
Many many congratulations to Leicester City on winning it's maiden FA Cup.
Ideal management, owner so close with environtment
Best Leicester season besides 2016 in their history imo. What a team
Congratulation Leicester city
This also for Khun Top's dad too.
Congratulations to Leicester from a Chelsea fan
No wonder Vardy has stayed at Leicester, he has everything a professional player needs and a player needs. Not so much money but love, team spirit, passion etc ... Great example to some other so called professionals. Good luck to Leicester, we are all so jealous lol. Arsenal fan.
Now I hope the whole of the epl team recognize that arsenal winning 14 fa cup tittles was no fluke, Chelsea have lost 3 finals in the fa cup in recent times lol
From a Liverpool fan congrats to Leicester they deserved it so much and beautiful to see
This was heartwarming bruh...
Just like the champions of Scotland, the famous Glasgow Rangers.
Terharu juga untuk hadiah mendiang ayah pemilik klub
So glad a non so called big 6 didn't win today. Well done Leicester 👏
We in Thailand love football and premier league we wanted to buy Liverpool but bought man city
The owner deserve a statue at king power stadium along with those legendary player vardy,morgan , schmeichel etc
Just chill..arsenal win this title so many times
I'm a Chelsea fan, regardless of decisions, if it was this or that, it was deserved, gg.
Not gonna lie. Hate Leicester but this brought a tear to my eye. My so called big 6 Arsenal had dried them up! 😪
Loool you'd need to pay the Glazers a couple mills at least to show up to this. It's a chore to them,, sad to know that as a MANU fan, as well 😓

The relationship between the Owner, players and manager is there for the world to see. Beautiful. Khun Top and his father has properly taken care of the club. Congrats to Leicester for the FA Cup win!
Congrats to Leicester. Their love is rooted in the love & passion of the game from the owner. He is a true leader
Thais have a completely different concept of biz ness and owning a football club, it’s in there Buddhist culture....
Big celebration in Thailand. Well done Leicester City. Cheers from The Gunner.
In few years or so people will definitely be kicking themselves in regret for missing the opportunity to buy and invest in cryptocurrency
Owners like Glazers would never ever do this
I'm upset of the result, I've been a chelsea fan since birth but this is absolutely adorable.

Im jealous, sitting here having Kronkae as an owner. 🦊🔵Well Done Leciester🔵🦊

who else thought the chairman got an afro in the thumbnail
Congr8 Leicester as FA Championeee.. 😍From LFC fan.. Good job.. ✌️💪🇲🇾
And then there are the Glazers
Not gonna lie. I teared up. This is a football owner, and not the thumb shaped-headed pricks that runs United
Tough time for the owner during the pandemic, most of their duty free shops closed down in airport. Hope he enjoyed the trophy
Well done Leicester. Massive respect. A big win for football.
Best owner in EPL
Love it this is called real man team real owner real man bravo 👏
From a Tottenham fan with a new stadium with no trophies 🏆...well done.
👏🏆👍👏
Vichai would be happy that Leicester’s curse on winning the fa cup is broken and champions league guarantee
Incredible achievement for Leicester anyone who now thinks that arsenal and spurs are in the big 6 ahead of them hasnt watched the prem in years
So Happy for the Club/fans/players the manager and owners. respect and love from a LFC fan!
Sure I’m in pain… but I could not think of a other club I’d rather get beaten by! Amazing moment with your owner there and well played  💙
Real team real owner
Well done Leicester. As a United fan I've never been so jealous. It's not about the trophy, it's about the culture and ownership of the club.
Kuhn Vichai looking and smiling from the sky . Congratulations!
This is beautiful. How football should be.
Amazing thailand
This is what True Football really is, Shame on other owners that treat our Beloved game as a Greedy biz, Fk them. This shows we still have Hope in Football & that Owner deserves Everybody's Heart
Im a Arsenal fan but, leicester just earned a place in my heart.
We get it, Rio doesn't like the glazers
Wow!!!
A United fan and when I saw him in the stand I was hoping he would come on and proud of Leicester goalkeeper who went and got him from the stand so touching have to admit to it even though not my club.. Really happy they won that trophy because this was a special moment for his family in regards to the tragedy 3 years ago.
Its win for chineese✌🏻
Leicester so lucky to have owner like that.
leicester won our heart
I am chelsea fans, but i have manly tears watching this, football is have great emotion
This is beautiful.
Brilliant....❤️LC Foxes!
Huge respect for their owner, not even sure if Stan Kroenke knows when we play 🙄
And then u got arsenals and uniteda owners who wouldnnt even go to their teams final
Imagine if Joel Glazer came on the pitch and tried to lift a trophy United had just won. There would be a riot.
Today Leicester City have won all of our hearts
I could not be prouder to be a Leicester fan. We are so lucky to have such amazing owners.
I got goosebumps this is what the beautiful game is about
That is so wholesome this is why I love football forget this super league bullshit
Much respect from Leeds, great team Leicester
Well deserved to the owners and players to the fans
What a player tielemans is
คุณต๊อบ คุณเก่งเหมือนพ่อคุณเลยท่านคงให้วิทยายุทกับคุณจนคุณเเข็งเกร่งเเละประสบความสำเร็จเหมือนท่าน
Poor Chelsea... Their goal var checked, Leicester goal no var check. Robbery?
Everyone bumming the owners as if they wouldn’t have joined the super league if they were offered 😂😂
A massive congratulations to Leicester. I almost fell like a foxes fan after seeing the owner celebrate with the club. This club is going places and what a way to be present. I wish Arsenal and so many other club owners with take a cue from Top
What a lovely man..
i am absolutely loving this well done great win  all my love for the owner and his late dad  go on leicester have bonkers celebration
I wish Man United to win Europa League so that we can also celebrate like this
That's a win for football right there. From a hammers fan X
Congrats from a Blackburn Rovers fan 🎉🎉
So a Great Club❤️
Thank god rent boys didn’t win it. Now beat them again on Tuesday so that they won’t qualify for CL
The light limit distinctly request because kettledrum typically preach afore a frightened frightening full fumbling functional toilet. damaging, cuddly believe
Man like Hamza doing the bengalis proud 🇧🇩
He is a true owner.
When the son lifted the trophy and pointed to the sky this was dedicated to his father, what a club.
ผมเป็นแฟนเชลซีรู้สึกประทับใจที่ได้เห็นภาพนี้

Now this is what football is all about truly the beautiful game.
Beautiful day for football
This is a real footballl club !!

Mike Ashley
This is what owners of other clubs should aspire to do to see the owner celebrate with the players shows how much he really cares for the club
This is why we were against the super league . Any team can make it to the top .
Wow love it! Hopefully Liverpool OWNERS are watching this and be like one
Congratulation to The Leicester Family from the Red Devils <3
He's holding it like a baby... What a man. Lucky Leicester
No doubt everyone is happy and all, but each time they showed the TIFO of Khun's dad, a part of me wishes he was here to witness this glory.  Take a Bow lads!
Say thanks to VAR.. So useless...
what a wholesome moment, i hope other owner also treat their clubs like this.
To Leicester City ....Just wanna Say Love ❤️ 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙 ~ A CHELSEA fan
THAT IS PURE FOOTBALL MAGIC....... A CLUB WITH A FAMILY SPIRIT...................... THAT'S MOST POSITIVE THING I HAVE SEEN IN FOOTBALL FOR DECADES....... TAKE A BOW LEICESTER CITY FC
Can't wait till United lift the european cup with Glazer 😅
This is amazing , tears flowing from my eyes unbelievable stuff
This may be the only team that every football fans alway happy to see them win.
Who cares?
As a leicester fan I feel so connected with the owners it's ridiculous
I’m a Man Utd Fan; yet I am very happy for & congratulate Leicester for their FA Cup success.   Seeing Club ownership being so integrated with the fandom of the Club and so passionately invested in Its success is amazing. Also frustrating after the whole Super League debacle that so many Bug Clubs lack that owner-Team connect.
I've never seen an Arsenal owner hug the FA cup like he has. This is what investing in a club means. Well done, Leicester.
Respect to this relation  Nice
Truly a model
Wow can there be anything more whole some than this in 2021
What a rich experience it must be to own a club this way, feeling fully connected to it. The bad times will feel worse, but these good times  must be so sweet!
As a Tottenham fan Leicester are more of 'Top 6' club than us
Fans are always the power of football.
Beautiful scenes of glorious emotion
This made me smile
ดีใจมาาาาาาาาาาาก
There is no negative comment in this video, its prove that leicester is club tjat never been hated
The best football moment in my life ❤️🙌 the oldest cup, the purest team, the most amazing owners ❤️
Now I can imagine my size against those European player. They're big 😮
I almost cry when Tielemans hug the owner with Joy.
Leicester is almost everyone's favorite second team, love seeing them win a cup
Happy for these _Foxes!_ Formidable fight and a banger of a goal to win it. Chuffed as well for _Rodgers_ on his first trophy in _England._ This is probably the best run club in the country. I wouldn't be surprised to see _Daniel Levy_ go in hard to poach _Rodgers..._
Thats a dream relationship to have with your owner. Makes the club seem a whole lot more genuine in it's solidarity. Three pillars of the club all unified. Owners, the team and the fans 👏👏 congrats Leicester City on the marvelous win 💪🏼
Congratulations 👏👏👏
Footbal brings us together 🤝❤️
I'm a liverpool fan fairplay to Leicester great win and they have great players a great manager and a great chairman while we have a stupid yank who's cares about money and nothing else anyway fairplay to Leicester
I'm happy for Leicester and the owner. Great to see owner loved by the players and fans alike. Unlike Glazers
R.I.p to his father
A truly wonderful moment in a torrid time for football - every fan wants an owner like this for their club, magnificent 👏 congratulations Leicester City
Feel happy for brendan and his squad. He deserved better especially coming short on winning the epl as liverpool manager. Welldone
Enjoy guys we hope all owners their can learn something from this lovely club I'm Liverpool fans but Leicester made my day for they are incredible owner
As a chelsea fan, sometimes i just hope that our team concede first. After a goal behind, then it will woke up the players to play more attacking. Always like that.   Whats the point greater in possesion, while actually they are just play backpass, and passing sideways.   Kudos to Leicester. They are far more hungry to score.
Let's me honest a lot of that emotion from the owner was not down to Leicester winning the cup. It was in memory of his father. That is why the players appreciate him so much because it goes beyond the actual game. It is life.
That was just beautiful
As an arsenal fan, once we get relegated from the premier league I'll start supporting Leicester.
Absolute class display from everyone bon that pitch. Congratulations Leceister 👋🏾👏🏾👋🏾👏🏾
Massive respect to the Leicester boys. Can see how much it means to the owner and of course towards the memory of his dad who was in a fatal and sad freak accident. This Is football. This is what it’s about
So called super 6, what a disappointment to the game
What a pleasure to watch this was.
111111111111111111111
Love it!
This is the link & passion between Owner and team members, it will not happen to the bottling team Spurs under Daniel Levy, that's why they were 13 years no trophy !!!  Keep on Leicester City, get your top 4 and walk in the Champion League with head upright !!!
The people who disliked this video have miserable lives.
leicester fan must be proud to have the owner like khun .And we all must be happy that there are some owner like khun top in modern era that love football
Yep, I'm jealous. That seems like a United club
Trying to picture the Glazers or Kroenke or Abramovich or head of FSG etc running onto the pitch and celebrating winning silverware is both difficult and funny
As a man city fan I loved watching this game, remember when the foxes won in 2016, that was what I call unity and an underdog story. Most importantly they have a tight bond with the owner, Leicester city is that one reject group that ppl make fun of but then they perform sick feats and everyone wanna shut up(or even some cases play victim). Glad there nothing but positive and wholesome comments here and that nobody here is jealous of the success of an underdog. Again love from a man city fan, wish us the best in the UCL final🙏🏾.
Glaziers comment anyone.
This is so beautiful 💗
Not a Leicester fan but they have a great set up and will continue to grow with this man in charge. Massive respect to him and his father for what they've brought back to football which is passion from top to bottom. Massive respect
As a ManUtd fan I wish my club has the same connection with the owners as Leicester does.
Congratulations brothers
Wonderful club 👍
Wow .... teardrops
Damn that is so beautiful, the way he treats the manager and players. Would never see Kroenke and the Glazers doing this they don't even know when we are playing.
Well done Leicester, great to see unity.
Need this ownership in Arsenal
He's real love football. The great owner. Make me tear with happy. 😢😢
This is beautiful. This is how football should be.
Gokil nih leicester 👍👍👍
The difference between an Owner (in it for life) and an Investor (in it for £).
I'm a city fan and this almost made me tear up that's football man
so happy for them, the club, and the fans. they deserve it!
Is there a football fan out there who didn't like this.. Maybe Roy Keane thought their was too many hugs but that doesnt count
This owner is a true fan! Hope leceister gets to win the PL one day
Best football club owner in the entire world
Win because cheating by VAR! Very SHAME! Chelsea deserve to win 🙄
Love It. Making Asians everywhere Proud. 🇲🇾
This is football
Good example owner of a club
Happy for Leicester, happy for the owner, love football, love the players, love the audience, be embraced...
Leicester win marred by Chowdury holding Palestinian flag. Thought this was being kicked out of football.
If only every club’s owners were as decent as this man. I’m happy for Leicester.
Plenty more silverware to come for our wonderful cub. 🥳🥳🏆🏆🥇🥇🦊🦊
Really happy for Leicester City and Football
Im Man City fans, congrats to Leicester city  Tactic strategy is the number 1 in football Good defence and good save from Schmeichel
Not a Leicester fan but delighted for them and their proper owners. An example to others.
Fantastic moment 👏🏾
O próximo pode ser você Alan Paece é só investir direito kkk.
❤️
United fans are crying seeing this
Congratulations Leicester City!! Owner would be smiling down on what he has created. What a bond this club has.
Leicester owner >>>>> Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City, Tottenham, Liverpool ( the " Big 6" Super League greedy owners )
Wish united had owner like him
The story of Leicester is why we didn’t want a super league
What a decade for Leicester.
I wish Vichai was here to see this. R.I.P
😭💙
As a Leicester fan I just love how owners have changed the whole perception of owning a football and someone just buying the club splashing cash.  Top is a top man brought the whole city together as a community twice within 5 years
I think he maybe is only one of chairman that all players and staffs love him the most. 🤙🤙
I found it impossible not to smile while watching this 😊 Well done Leicester city & Well Deserved
THIS is how football should be. To all the absent owners, get out of our game.
Congratulation
God I love Leicester
Stop Asian Hate
Respect from rans united fan
This is awesome
🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭
The ironic thing is, this happens a lot in America with NFL owners celebrating with coaches managers and players. It’s not as if Premier League owners are that dissimilar, it’s just because they have no interest, involvement or respect for football in the U.K.. Especially the Glazers, John Henry, Kronke. Abrahamovic does care, but is a very low key guy.  Full respect to this little Thai guy though
What a champion. Good bloke.
The Leicester owners should be the benchmark for what every football club owner aims to be
Congratulations Neighbour
Congratulations to Leicester city. ♥️♥️♥️♥️😍😍😍💥💯⚡
This is A Football 💙
I'm a fans since they won the premier league
This is freaking beautiful man.. made me tear up!
Class
even tho im a chelsea fan, that was beautiful
The glazers, Kroenke just left the group chat...
LEICESTER IS UCL CHAMPION
This close relationships between owner, players and fans are amazing, but still nothing compared to the glazers and MU players and fans.
This is the most brilliant moment in English football history.  👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾💯💯💯💯💯💯
This is just beautiful.....
Man utd should do this with the glazers but present them with a plane out of Manchester and back to the US.
Darn. I just think of Shilton and Banks. 2 of the greatest Leicester and England goalkeepers who lost in FA cup finals
Well done Kaspar for bringing the owner down onto the pitch to share the moment; and giving us all a model of how a premiership club should work - players, manager, owner and fans all invested in the same project.
เห็นภาพคุณต้อบลงไป...ในสนาม แล้วน้ำตาไหล ใด้ใจทุกคน
🦊.🎉🎉🎉🏆🏆
I'm Chelsea fans, but I respect with Leicester. Congrats Lei...
This is football. The owner should go down as a legend 🙌
สุดยอด  ดีใจจน เมื่อคืน นอน ไม่หลับ  ต้องมาดูไฮไลย์ ย้อนหลัง
This is what owner should be, not like glazer or kroenke
From a utd fan I’m so jealous
I'm a Chelsea fan, and there's no better team to lose against. Congrats to the foxes.
Eat ur heart out Glazer and Woodward.
As arsenal Fan, I had tears saw the chairman hug rodgers with emotionally, never saw this before, this is what the chairman should be
This is beautiful- congratulations Leicester!
This was why all football fans in the world reject ESL 🤗💪
Not like glazer...such a a******
This is football
I love this
As a United fan seeing this makes me remember what football should be , an owner who cares about the club and the clubs success , i think I’m a Leicester fan deep down now
I envy this club's OWNERS SO MUCH 👊❤👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 I'D LOVE THEM AT ARSENAL THEY ARE THE PERFECT EXAMPLE TO FUTURE OWNERS❤
This is  magnificent
IT’S JUST A FA CUP TITLE. TRASH TITLE. LOL
More than a club,it’s a family💙
สิ่งที่หลายทีมไม่มีคือการเป็นกันเองของท่านประธานสโมสรความรักที่ท่านมีแกสโมสรแบบจริงจัง.คิดถึงคุณวิชัยเลย
Leicester is run really well. This is amazing
Absolutely delighted for Leicester and their fans. Look how much the FA cup means to them. Was lovely to see them really cherish it rather than seeing other teams constantly treating it like a consolation prize.  That's what the cup used to mean to teams before money took over and became everything.
Meanwhile the Kroenkes wont touch their players and fans with a 10 foot pole.
If I were to really support a PL team it would be Leicester City.
as a chelsea fan i still say its a important win for leicester and his old owner R.I.P.
This is poetry
Leicester are special :) and i am not even a fan :)
Owners like this should be encouraged on every level.
Idc if we lose to Chelsea in the ucl final no more this put a smile to my face
Wonderful! From an Evertonian well done Leicester, terrific result, just beat them again next week! Jamie Vardy - genuine Roy of the Rovers! Delighted his loyalty to his club (hello Wayne) has resulted in another trophy. Well done!!!
"Big 6" Take notice.
I’m jealous of this bond. This family. Kreonke out.
Amazing football club. The arrogance of them top 6 clubs a few weeks ago. This is what it’s about winning not making money.
Well deserved, Tielemans is world class and only 24 the guy only gets better each game. Would love him at Chelsea
🙌
i am starting to support leicester from now on what a team and kudos to them,,,teary moment,,,greedy glazers wont never understand
Is this Champions League  final?? Lol 😂😂😂
This is wonderful to see
I am happy for brendan.. and football
We can all agree that Leicester is a bigger team than Spurs
Even though I am not a Leicester City fan, I am so damn touched and almost teared up by seeing how amazing it is to witness the owner is being so close and celebrating along with the team!!
Congrats for Leicester especially for Vardy a lot of respect,he deserved this victory❤️(as a Chelsea fan)
Im so Jealous as a united fan. I wish we had owners like Leicester
This is football, Please show this video to Super league leaders
jealous of this
What an unbelievable football/sporting moment........No team,manager or owner more deserving.
im not crying youre crying
Meanwhile Arsenal..  Sigh...
Liverpool fan here, delighted for leicester, great to see the owner in the mix! Its how football should be
owner very humble, friendly people
This is y I love lieicester
Leicester is an amazing club.... I am very jealous of their owner as an Arsenal fan
Wow, respect and I'm a Chelsea fan.
มันเป็นภาพที่ประทับใจ กับแฟนเลสเตอร์ จากใจ Thailand
That was something special. Kick out that Glazer mob in Florida and bring this guy in.
And to think I though there was no passion for football anymore and just about the money. Glad I watched this because it proved me wrong. Honestly glad to see this!!! Well deserved leister 😎😎
Love it! And thank god to have a club that cares so much about winning the FA Cup. The competition has been devalued and it deserves better. Seeing and hearing the fans was so good too. They add immeasurably to the drama.
as a chelsea fan i’m pretty disappointed in our loss, but i’m happy leicester were the team to beat us. such a great owner and football club
This is what football is all about
Emotional and I'm Man Utd fan, absolutely jealousy with how owner connect and represent the Club and fans.
Well done Leicester delighted for them what a proper owner is like unlike that cretin kroenke, great to see more supporters back in stadium.
Anyone else feeling sad for chelsea,coz man city wld celebrate in there fronts next final they play
As a man utd fan this makes me smile,true meaning of football to see this
Yep that got me 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
ยีนดีด้วยครับ💙💙💙🦊🦊🦊
i m a Manchester United Fan since ages, but i feel very happy to see Leicester and especially them Thai onwer celebrating like a whole family,,, congrats guzys , lets now Man United win the Europa cup
Brilliant! Congrats LCFC !!!  YNWA
As a united fan this is what we wish to have
Love, respect and trust given by the owner and in return the boys have presented him with the trophy. I hope the other clubs will take lesson from this down to earth attitude and transparency. From this clip it is clear why Leicester as a club is doing so well. Well done 👍
🇹🇭❤️
Coronaa 😀
I support Liverpool, but I hope I can see Liverpool and Leicester City in the Champions next season. Congrats Leicester 👏
Why in the thumbnail the FA cup trophy's inner side is like a boil of soup 😂
it is so emotional, what a brilliant club, from the Boss to the Manager and the team! Well desevered
Ye gotta love it
This will never happen with the glazers & man utd and arsenal & kroenkes
Biggest club in england.
this is awesome
Big Club moment. His father would be proud
Top man 😊
And they didn’t want leicester in the super league.......
I fell in love with this team!
We need more owners like this in football. not running after money 💰
Absolutely amazing. This is what our beloved game is about. Respect to everyone at Leicester City Football Club. Villa Fan....
THis is just pure class. I love what Leicester have as a club. So happy for them. Class to see YNWA
Tottenham have the audacity to believe they're a bigger club than Leicester
This is what an owner should be doing.. well done Leicester really well deserved from an arsenal fan
nice celebration..chairman...manager..player..all team leicester they are big family
Just so happy for Leicester. ❤️YNWA
This puts a huge smile on my face and I don't even support Leicester
Am a Villa fan, but this almost makes me cry... big congrats to Leicester city!
Sobbed at this  they deserved it as this guys father did big love xx
Congratulations bruh how can u hate😂👏👏
เยี่ยมมากเลยครับ
No supposed to hug until Monday!!! Well done Leicester City 👏👏👏
I'm a arsenal fan, congratulations to Lester and all there fans, I just wish we had a owner who is that well connected with his club.
As an Arsenal fan, I must admit, I’m jealous. The harmony that the Leicester owners create at their club is an inspiration. This is how a football club should be run. Big respect to Leicester City and their fans! They deserve everything they’ve achieved and more!
0:59 what a gesture from the owner
Wonderful ♥️🔥
Florentino Perez: We don’t do that here
Beautiful ❤
Like glazer🙄
QPR fan here..So so happy for Leicester, especially their owner and fans..Rubbish first half  but the second half gave us a Brilliant goal, 2 Brilliant saves and a Brilliant VAR decision..How can yo not  feel absolutely delighted for the Foxes..verging on tears to be honest...What a story and what a journey LCFC have been on.. Hats off and fair play to them..its what makes us love the game  ! 👏👏
This moment is so beauty, congrats tu Leicester
And this football fans is why Manchester United fans are unhappy with their owners, Respect to Leicester
If this Leicester side win another premier league or even a European trophy or even become a regular top 6 side it will be so amazing but so sad that his father can’t see it 🥲
First I am seeing a chairman so involved
City fan, and we like our owners - but this is a joy to watch. Such a shame his father was not here to see it.
I am in tears. I will never see Glazier doing that......  I am a United fan. Congrats Leicester!!!!
I support a club not involved in the final, but it feels like my club have won it? I can't describe this feeling. So happy for Leicester.
This will never happen at Arsenal in my lifetime... Ps I'm 28
Well done Leicester, what that club and owners have been through. Well deserved. Liverpool fan here.
129 dislikes for what reason? °(`×_×`)°
💙 Love Definitely Lives Here 💙
][̲̅L][̲̅i̲̅][̲̅k̲̅][̲̅e̲̅]🇹🇭💛👍😉
Oh Leicester... what a fairytale!
I can’t even hate this and I’m a Chelsea fan.
The worst thing is that they had to play in that disgusting away kit.
Roy Kean: Hugging* Nonsense!!
Congratulations from pompey. Amazing to see that relationship between the chairman, player and fans.
What a great man 🐐
Its nice to c a trophy coming back to midlands but the other side once again well done villa supporter
Dynamite
If Man Utd won and the Glazers came down the pitch to celebrate, all the players will spit at their face. Then again, the Glazers will never come down.
*Amazing. Nuff said.*
Would never happen in the super league
I'm a Man United fan, and this just makes me hope Ek gets hold of Arsenal
Gave me goosebumps all over ❤
คนไทยภูมิใจ🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🌏
Thumbnail says it all!
This use to be Manutd now we are like QPR
adding leicester as one of my favorite clubs
💙💙
No wonder Vardy never left despite being able to get into any top club starting 11
Leicester is everyone's favorite second team
Class
Big respect.. love this club. From LFC fan..
Thailandddddddddd
Love it!!
As a Londoner I was at Wembley today passing through doing some shopping and it touched my heart to see the spirit & diversity of the Leicester fans they are just simply a different class to a lot of other fans, non-aggressive, with great banter...then the Chelsea fans turned up and the atmosphere felt totally different and hostile, I wanted to clear off soon...
I'm a massive manchester united fan and I wish to god we had owners like that gelouse doesn't even begin to say how I feel seeing how Leicester embrace him
Enough to make a grown man cry this is football
I love football ❤️🙌 well done Leicester 👏👏👏
Congratulations to Leicester City for finally winning the FA Cup. May this club continue to be successful and win more trophies with the support and admiration that all of football has for this club.
This is brilliant stuff. So much needed during this global pandemic.  It radiates love and togetherness
Am envious of Leicester as a man u fan
Mantap
As a chelsea fan I'm mad but the better team won well done Leicester
After the recent negativity around the super league, this final truly made every football fan happy no matter the team they support or the outcome they wanted⚽️🤍
Wow... amazing owner. Amazing harmony between team and management. This is the 2nd time i saw an owner like this. 1st one is massimo moratti Inter milan.
This is gonna make me a leicester supporter. What a scene!
I'll have a Leicester kind of owner please.
This is a proper football club, well done Leicester. An Italian who lives, mostly, in London.
Respect and 💙 from a Spurs fan; congratulations to the whole Leicester F.C. organisation
He deserves it he paid Michael Oliver
Congrats from an Arsenal fan to Leicester City.A victory for the ownership/management/players & staff & the city itself. For 90+ minutes the fans & the magic of the FA Cup returned. Let this be a footballing lesson to the I'll fated European Super League owners/investors !!!
i would do anything to have an owner like this that actually cares at my club
As a Utd fan, how jealous am I now of Leicester. what an owner-
From a ManUtd fan..This is what football's all about. Nothing but love and respect for Top and his late father. Other owners should take notes.
What a team!! That was a how the team should be. Great player, great coach, great owner make a remarkable ambience. Congratz lads..
Very cool.
RESPECT For LEICHESTER
Hats off and massive respect to Khun Top. His love for the club is amazing. Leicester deserves this and what a way to make history 👏👏
"They back their club, they back their managers, there's a face to it" Fabulous to see this. Villa fan here and great to see Leicester winning it.
Seperti dongeng sebelum tidur... Selamat The fox...
From arsenal I'm jealous. . .
The greatest underdogs in world sport
Well done to the fans who booed the taking of knee 👏👏👏👏
His dad will be very proud of him!
Man Arsenal needs a owner like this
Congratulations to Leicester. Better team won
All I see here is a fan of the club celebrating on the pitch with its players.
Congrats..u deserve it so much!
Feel happy as a football fans ..
Wow! Absolute Beauty.  Owners of clubs should learn from this. This is family.  Hope Man united learn from this.
Biblical   Just.... Biblical ❤  (Man u fan)
Bloody love that from the foxes. incredible.
unreal
This is the owner I wished Arsenal had. An owner that actually CARES for the club and the fans. Well done Leicester, well done
Ps. 120 psychopaths (dislikes) watched this video  How can u dislike this?!
I dont care about this match but this was amazing Im very happy for Leicester, they fully deserved it. Huge congratulations to Leicester!
💙💙💙😍
As a Chelsea supporter this result led to conflicting emotions. Leicester deserved it though, they were better at taking their chances and Schmeichel was brilliant in goal.  Everything that has happened to the ownership as well. . .they deserved to celebrate something. Hopefully Chelsea can learn from this and finish the season strong against City in the CL. Congratulations to LCFC.
This is what an owner of a club in Europe should be like
i felt emotional when i saw this! this is the way how relations in a club should function!!! nothing mr. Abramovich, but he deff wouldn't come to the pitch if Chelsea won! Congrats Foxes and of course congrats mr.  Rodgers!! good day for football lovers!!
I wish arsenal owners was like this
Amazing, huge respect to LC! 😃
This is how other football owners are measured upon after this. U can't not like Leicester...
RIP Vichai. Your son has done such a good job
This is what football is about. This is how every owner of clubs up & down the country should be. Fair play Leicester enjoy your day
Gives me goosebumps. Beautiful to see
Beautiful scenes. Love for the game
Beautiful moment for the owners !! Congratulations.
best owner in sports.

I’m a chelsea fan and even though I love the FA Cup and I’m really disappointed that we lost, even I can stand by and love seeing this. This is how good football can be❤️
Where eric tohir 👍
We love our owners and they love us back, the unity at our club is something truly special.
The Kroenke's are jelly.
Beautiful!
My mom loves Peter Smichael bcoz my dad was a great Man United fan n mom remembered Peter .. I told her that's Peter's son. So she supported n watched till the end.
Well done Leicester city 👍🍺🏆🥇
Seeing Top point to the sky. My emotions
Damn I envy the relationship between the players, fans, and the owner. This is how football teams should be. The 'big six owners' need to look and learn. That hug between Rodgers and Khun shows a special bond and mutual respect. Congratulations Leicester 👏 The progress this team has displayed over the years is remarkable.
I love this ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Such a legend if ur not cutting onions watching this ur not human
This is just brilliant. I hope the Glazers are watching… this is what club ownership should look like
Beautiful 🤩
This is what football is about.
The difference between a boss and a leader!! Pure illustration!
Congratulations to Leicester
khun is like mr mrs ms

Crazy
Seeing the Leicester owner look upward to Heaven at full time was so moving - massive congratulations to them!
This is what I like to see from these owners. His father was a brilliant man and changed leicster forever and his son. Love to see it well done Khun Top and leicster for winning FA cup
meanwhile,  Inter Milan won the League, yet, the owner ask the players to cut their salary.

Asian owners > american owners
Inspirational seeing the owner care, as a football fan this is what we want...
Emotional. Beautiful. This is what football is all about.
I'm so jealous of Leicester City. I'm so bloody envious.  Arsenal HAVE TO get Ek in to buy the club. This is what they can have. (Not success necessarily. But atmosphere)  [I'm a Manchester United fan. There are just no offers]
The Time when Thai people come to this club and become the owner. that's the moment of destiny that change this club forever!!! From Championship team become Top Team!!!! Leicester peoples should love Thai peoples very much. They are in huge debt of them. The players are all love Thai Owner. ♥
Every club needs an owner like this

Show of love…. The chairman is an amazing person…Big up
We need this at Arsenal

Much love and respect this is what football should be about ❤️🥲
حتى  عبدالعزيز عاشور احتفلوا فيه لاعبين العربي
Brought a smile to my face😁
Most entertaining club ❤️
I’m happy for him, but once again i will be only one to think that winning with a multi millionaire is not a miracle like the Premier.
5000-1 champions and now this! massive respect from a toon fan
Smile on my face after seeing this beautiful moment, happy for Leicester
😂😂this amazing but yes I’m sure if the city owners came on the pitch the city players would love them. Been watching football for a decent amount of time now and city owners are very loved by the fans and players
This is the special of LCFC...compared to others...'they will envy'...'the collcaboration of everybody in the club'...'everybody have to point to one direction'...👍💪...❤ from Thai neighbour (Msia)...😁
Every Football Manager player loving this.
I'm really glad Leicester won it, and not just because I had a bet on them.
dang! How can u not love this club?!? Well done Leicester!
Coming from a United fan I envy there owners 😫
Amazing to see
I am very proud to be a Leicester fan right now
Watching this makes me cry same times smiling amazing connectiom between players and club owners
And they have a captain who knows how to bring all stakeholders on board. He was doing the whole social coordination; including bringing the chairman to the pitch.
Proper owner not like these American businessmen
Brought a tear to my eye and I’m a Liverpool fan
Please someone send and show this video to the Glazers with the remark: "Watch and learn".
He's the owner not chairman btw but we'll done and congrats to Leicester from a swansea city fan 💪🤝 Fully deserved
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼from Thailand 🏆🏆🏆🏆
Now THAT'S a owner...👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Wow ❤️
Basically this is what everyone would want at any club
Beautiful scenes of glorious emotion
As a Thai I'm so proud of him
Leicester city Football Club are building a legacy in the right way.. Congrats on the FA Cup..
Best club in the world!
LADIES AND GENTS : FOOTBALL👏🏾
What a bittersweet moment and I'm glad the our fans and players decided today was the day to memorialise 'the gaffer'. A beautiful moment.
God bless him and may his father RIP ❤
Undeserved.
As a Chelsea fan I'd like to congratulate Leicester and I'm glad it was them who beat us, whilst also being salty at the stupid offside rule hopefully Arsene Wengers idea of allowing slight offsides to favour attacking football get brought into the game.
From an Arsenal Fan. I want also a chairman who loves the club like him 😪 Well done Leicester.
Best owner i PL
Congralutation
Terrible win
Beautiful this is why i love football
Exemplary from a BWFC man
Meanwhile Maguire is still waiting for a trophy ......
Terrible wins
yet manchester united fans wanted to implement the 50+1 rule ,if its happens we will never get to see moments like this ever again
God bless Nigeria!
When I watched the title,I thought it's another exaggeratory title from a English media channel. Surprised and also glad, to be proved wrong.
Hahahaha amazing this
And Glazer family will not be in Gdansk come Europa final
The Outstanding team🏆
Fantastic result,well deserved,great to see a football club with owners connected to the players and fans- YNWAxx
Love from Everton the passion and love he has with the team and the team towards him is so beautiful to see really amazing well done Leicester
Great team congrats guy.
This shows how a club should be run and history also shows that. A hell of a lot of owners should take note and learn what Leicester are doing not like the current crop of owners of clubs particularly in the premier league that are utter wastes of space. And simply don’t care about the fans or the clubs history or the English game history. And they are so out of touch with fans they might as well be on another planet which they must be because they come up with dumb ideas.   It’s so refreshing to see, hear and watch Leicester in all aspects a proper football club run the proper way and the respect goes in all directions long may the story continue.
Congratulations Leicester City on your victory.  Wonderful scenes of genuine love and respect between players, manager, and Chairman.
Beautiful to see   Leeds fan
Yeah, that's class that.
Wish Man Utd have a owner like this who acc loves the club man  Credit and respect to him Leicester deserve this 🙌🏿🙌🏿❤️
VAR robbed us of a good game
I’m a Chelsea fan but I’m also Thai....... really proud of what i saw really warm really feel like home
Kasper, Wes Morgan, Jamie Vardy, Fuchs and all this boys are Leicester LEGENDS ❤️
Yeah so right . Absent owners - a fitting description of the relationship between the owners of the  once dreaded Arsenal football club (now a laughing stock) and its supporters.
Jealous
He would never join the super league. 👏🏿👏🏿😭❤️
The arsenal fans seeing this and wishing it in our club
I'm not a fan... But i uave to admit it... This is pure Beauty.
Wish my club had owners like that 😢
GLAZERS_OUT
How would the manchester united supporters react if the glazer family lifted the fa cup trophy.
As a celtic fan . I'm happy for Brendan Rodgers.  I think he will go on to do big things else where .
I’m a Man U fan and this is fantastic, this is football, this is pure, this is the history that the parasites tried to take away. Everyone deserves to dream, everyone deserve the right to win. I loved watching this today. P.S. man of the match VAR! I have never been more delighted at a decision 👍
The owner must be a great n passionate  man who really loves and understand football, unlike some other club's owners.  He must  be treating everyone so well at the club looking at the way everyone hugs and cheering him on. Well done leicester. U deserve it!
I'm a Chelsea fan and I'm gutted we lost but this is class by Leicester such a well run club. If I had to choose a club to loose to in a cup final it would be them fairplay!
Leicester is better than Tottenham in winning trophies
Bet the dislikes are from Chelsea fans
As a Chelsea fan, I feel we didn't lose but Leicester won. This is special.
A lot of club owners can take something from this. Can’t help but admire how Leicester is run. Such a connection with their fans. Unlike what we put up with at United.
Well done Leicester and there owner very touching really great to see from a spurs fan
I am a Chelsea fan and sad that we lost , but looking at these scenes make me happy and love football more.Happy for Leicester, we were a bit unlucky, will meet again in 2 days .
They need to try sighn upto 3 world class players in different positions take them next level would have to pay 200k wk wages to become a establish top 4 side and the timing couldn't be better
Лестер отличный клуб. Это не бутафория какая-то в виде челси
Is this Bruce Lee?
Nothing but a big smile on my face watching this. He deserves it his family deserve it and so does his dad. Well done Leicester.
As a chelsea fan, I sad we lost, but this does make me smile
Congratulations Leicester City,, amazing team👍👍👍👍🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨❤❤
Great moment
Massive turning point for football and Big statement involving fans owners and how football should be .. well done Leicester and the owners 👏
Great to see an owner that has earned the respect from the fans and players. Invested in the team, the facilities and the city.
Major respect to BR, great manager and as a Liverpool fan I feel embarrassed by the way he was treated.
true owner! Other owners. TAKE NOTICE!
Super League club owners - Take notes 📝 👀👀
Emocionante!
Love our owners like family LCFC
Leicister city in safe hand 🤝
Fair play to leicester
The glazers are lik that
It’s Dua
Khun's father would be so proud of him for keeping the spirit alive
Look John Henry was at the at the trophy stage of the European cup final and the joy on his face when Henderson lifted the cup it was beautiful to see. My point is whatever went on with super league it doesn’t take away the love they have for the club
As a Chelsea fan, I'm really happy we lost, so I could actually see this🥺
Love our owners like family LCFC
Love our owners like family LCFC
Where are Covid measures ???? Everyone is hugging and kissing WTF
I'm a city fan but I'm so happy for Leicester. what a team.
Take note glazers !!!!!
Crazy that i have not one single bad thing to say about Leicester. I can find atleast 200 for my own club.
I never admitted this but today I feel like I'm a pro Leicester fan since they win the pl title
Leicester City in the last 5 - 6 years have proved themselves to be one of the best clubs in England... and are probably the model by which all clubs wish they were run in terms of management/ownership! Imagine calling yourself a big 6 club while winning nothing and/or struggling to get into Europe while Leicester have won Premier League titles and FA Cups, and consistently challenge for top 4 spots!! Days like today are why greedy owners should never be allowed the power to try and take 130+ years of heart, soul, innocence and competition away from this country!
Much love from a glasgow rangers fan that right there was what football is about , beautiful moment .
Imagine Stan Kroenke
Not a Leicester City fan but i loved this and somehow people still dislike this!🤦🏽‍♂️
One of the rare times I’m gonna say football actually won legit💯🔥
Well done from a Leeds fan 👊🏻
As a man united fan its very refreshing too see this
Nobody can hate them. Class owner and class manager and class team. Well done. From a Liverpool fan. 👏
this means a lot to a club such as Leicester
After, all the super League drama this is refreshing
I have worked on the Leicester stadium doing the boxes and executive bar and these owners what I saw worship this club. Good luck to them! Great result!
it's impossible to hate Leicester man
Respect from a united fan
IF U DONT FEEL THAT LOVE AND THAT PASSION U ARE A HATER
🤟🦊🎉🏆
Well done Leicester
Imagune kroenke at arsenal 😂
This isn’t just a win for Leicester, it’s a win for football.
This is what makes sport beautiful. Get rid of the lines between the money and the masses. It’s one. We all support the same cause for our team so it all be viewed as this club does it, family.
I want them to play UCL next season 🔥❤️
Great to see⚒
Welll done to Leicester 🙏
A shining example
Leicster won premier league in 2015 And now they won FA cup in 2020 I guess they will win champions league before 2025
I'm so freaking excited, that we have Kasper Schmeichel as our goalie @ EURO2021. He is outstanding in every single way. As a person and on the pitch. He is hugely underrated and could easily be playing for the top clubs in Europe. The reason why he is so successful, despite his obvious talent, is because he is patriotic and loyal to club and the national team!
Congratulation to Leicester. Great achievement. Lovely to see the chairman care about the club and the players to embrace him as they did.   Shows collectively how the whole team deserves it and that this is something the fans urn for.
More than team....it's a BIG FAMILY...... ove from Timor Island, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia....
Didnt deserve it
Leicester deserve it. Well done
This makes me want to be a Leicester city fan.
I wish my club could have an owner like him! We need owners who care about the fans and the players!
I'm a Man City fan but I loved watching Leicester celebrating today...beautiful to watch
What a club! Envious indeed
This is what football is really missing...😔
He is rare but don’t worry. Some more clubs will be take over by USA and Chinese. This will be a rare moment, now that Super League is dead to fund big clubs to pay their debts. Now Barcelona will soon be take over lol.
Kroenke doesn't even know what color away kit Arsenal play with 🤔
Lovely to see, so sad his father isn’t here to witness these great scenes.
This is why I love Leicester city underdogs of football 😍 I hope they play in CL next year
Must be nice
Congratulations Leicester City. This win was for your chairman
Forever Vichai💙🇨🇷
So good to see this, passionate owner. congratulations Leicester, from a pompey fan.
The fact he got a cheer from the fans as he lifted the trophy. The "big six" need to take a step back and take a look at this and see what owning a football club is all about.
Amazing
Anyone elsehappy that Chelsea will lose 2 Cup finals this year and hopefully drop out of top 4 that would get tuchel sacked 😂
Im so happy for them even im not a Leicester city fan 🤍
if and only if the glazers are just like this..
Most of the club fans hate their owners, not Leicester FC
Why Chelsea
Such a well run and likeable club
That's it buying their jersey, not a fan but seriously would rather see where my money goes. My tribute to such great owners.
Are the Glazers watching this? Maybe they can learn a thing or two from this club.
Im a derby fan and leicester city fc are a prime example of how a club should be run by owners who adore their club from top to bottom congratulations to all of Leicester your a credit to the premier league
Can't wait to similar scenes with the Glazers in a couple of weeks!
Amazing scenes
this is what football is about
Champions league soon
Well done Leicester City. Fantastic to see this. As a Leeds fan I can say that our owner and definetly our director of football Victor Orta would be there on the pitch celebrating if we  had the honour of lifting the F.A. Cup. Congratulations to a well run club!  Fully deserved!
This should be football
When Leicester won I celebrated like it was my own team to be honest 💪💪
So happy for Leicester...love from a Liverpool fan
O that so Beautifull
As a United fan I don't feel so bad about losing to them anymore, they deserved it in the end.
ฉันมีความสุขมากจริง ๆ 1-0  🙏🏽🙏🏽🇹🇭🇹🇭
I am Chelsea fan, congrats to Leicester City FC
Yeah, don’t think Rodgers is leaving for Spurs! 😆😆😆
Really happy for Leicester, a great owner makes a club moving forward...
Beautiful! Every other fan wants their club to be run like that.  Can clearly see in players eyes how much they respect and love the owners and vice versa. It's a proper connection
This is How Family Celebrate Success ❤️
Such a great example
Kroenke out,  we want an owner like him.
Love to see that! 💙💙💙  From man city fan  Congrats Leicester
♥️♥️♥️👏🏻
From an Arsenal fan , this is no more than they deserve! Makes me happy to see that !👊🏻
ปลื้มจนน้ำตาผมไหลตามเลย...แต่ตุณวิชัยคับ
Amazing. Fair play to them
Wow I nearly cried
I thought football clubs in england were lost with all the greedy foreigners owners untill i saw the foxes owner ,the father did his part and his son pursue the legacy,Congratulation leicester not only for the win but for having such a loyal owner💙💙💙💙👏👏👏👏
Fantastic achievement once more for Leicester City, congratulations.
Leicester city what a fantastic example of a what a football club should be
can only imagine Chelsea fans disliking this video :P
Leicester have the best owners in the premier league!!
Iam man u but how refreshing to see a genuine person owning a football club and being loved by all those within it...Brilliant
What a fantastic owner. Am not a Leicester fan but what a great club. Congratulations
Happy moment for Leicester.
Brilliant, from a very jealous Manchester United fan. Well played today Leicester City.
The only football team left in England that their players play heart out for the club not there for the money 🙏
why am i crying i support liverpool
That club is brilliant sending Bigest congratulations
Im a Liverpool fan and I hope the 77 people who have disliked this video stand barefoot on an up turned plug... literally nothing to dislike about this at all and should serve as a wake up call to a lot of owners because this is the spirit of football at its very god damn best
My respect for this club went through the roof . From an Arsenal fan . Wish we had owners like that
Fractured between  super top 6 fans and owners.   I'm more than happy with moshiri at Everton thanks Rio.
Love. It.
❤️
I was so salty being a Chelsea fan about the Chelsea offside and Leicesters handball but after watching this I’m so happy that Leicester won
ได้แชมเพราะกำมาการอย่าดีใจเกินไปนะ
Nope fuxk it im a Leicester fan
Special is the word for it. That owner kicked every single ball. He is so obviously a real fan.
Leicester city is what football is all about
Nice to see
I just love this club and their passion.
More owners should have such a good relationship with their players honestly, good for leicester
I, as a Spurs fan, am unbelievably jealous of Leicester for the owners they have
As a Chelsea fan, congrats on their win. Hopefully both of us can finish in the top 4
Amazing.
Man United, see this!
Well done fantastic win well deserved .. from a man u fan
What a owner Leicester   wish more like this
Beautiful to watch 👌🏼
This is what football is about. This is for the so-called Big Clubes.
People though Leicester was a one time thing it's not!!!
Congrats from a Chelsea fan. I am glad it was Leicester if not Chelsea.
Leicester fans and owner deserve this. I'm happy they win FA cup and playing in UCL next season.
Congratulations Leicester! Great scenes. Take care of the trophy for us! coyg!
After Leicester won, I am happy they did and I'm not so upset we (man utd) lost to them in that round
As a Chelsea fan I was honestly embarrassed by that disallowed offside goal. Leicester deserved it completely, we were passive and not up for a final. Congrats Leicester, a truly wonderful club.
What a club, great scenes 👏🏻
Beautiful moment unreal owners especially in this day and age
Why does even get disliked?  The relationship between the owner and the players is the most beautiful thing other than the stunner that Leicester scored
This is everything football ownership should be
Arsenal : Big deal we have more 😂
His Father is watching from heaven with a big smile ...
จิ้งจอกสยาม💙
Wow,  this is just so good to watch, who wouldn't want to play for Leicester City, what a football club
These owners pump money into the community and local charities. They provide free drinks at home games and leave prizes under the seats. That’s a real chairman!
From Manchester so touching to see this today amazing well done
Got a lil lump in me throat   Can’t imagine how much this must of meant to them all
THIS IS LEGENDARY 👑
Beautiful. Glazers should look at this and take the door out.
🇬🇧🇹🇭🇬🇧🇹🇭
Champions league zone and fa cup..stay up fox..
Which arsenal had owners like this send love to the foxes 🦊👏👏
Glazers would never do that......,oh wait we don't even win trophies
A small club to A BIG CLUB. With club owner be part of the team. What an honour to be part of this club
Jamie Vardy and Kasper Schmichael: “oh FA cup friends”
Me encanta el Leicester por qué me gustan las historias dónde un equipo que Es una familia gana sobre los más poderosos y este club es el ejemplo de que si se puede ser grande desde abajo y estando entre  gigantes soy Colombiano y voy por el Leicester ojalá gane muchos títulos más
This owner is the twelfth man of the Leicester squad... And with such a team approach, they'll beat anyone
Mashaallh
This is what football should be all about. Respect, family and passion. With all the negativity that's come around football these last few weeks, let this be the bar where we all need to be. Amazing job!
Very nice moment ❤️❤️ Tottenham fan what’s up
This right here is what football is about. As a Wolves fan I have huge respect for the achievements of Leicester and the process of building the club. After they suffered a devastating loss of the owner, they’ve rebounded in inspirational fashion. They  are no fluke.   Congratulations to the foxes.
Glazers and Kroenke would never done that because they gonna be stab by the fans for what they've done in past month.
beautiful really
Beautiful
This what make football great.  Family
Actually brought a tear to ma eye what that man has been through deserves this god bless 🙏🙏😥🍀🍀
Beautiful to watch
That epitomises Leicester City. A well run club that fosters excellence.
I love this video
Made up for Leicester glad they won Rodgers got be up there for manager of year
Congrats 🍾 Licester City🏆 I’m Chelsea fan and I’m from Thailand 🇹🇭
A club with a small budget can do wonders if the owners have the right mentality....example : Leicester City !
That is absolutely fantastic to see Leicester seems to be a gr8 club well done Brendan Rodgers and the boys
Prime example on how an owner of a football should be 💯 respect ❤️
As a Chelsea fan, Massive congrats to Leicester beautiful scenes with the owner after a tough period  💙
I hope Stan kroenke will follow this good example of the lecester owner.
You`ll never see those leaches Fenway or the Glazers getting treated like that. Proper football club not a franchise. GGMU LUHG
As a Chelsea fan, of course I really wanted to win and was annoyed that we had lost but after seeing this I’ve come to realise how much more it means to Leicester than it would of if Chelsea won so congratulations to them!
enough to make a grown man cry
Im Chelsea fan, im hurt we lose this match also im happy to see Leicester City making History. Congratulations to one of the nicest manager and underrrated manager in Premier league Brendan Rodgers. And Lfc having the best owner in English football. Congrats👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Damn if Man united could only be this knitted
Let's get it right in the Clf
Khun is a beautiful man
@ 1:20 shots fired at the Glazers & Co...
Mahn I am feeling jealousy
Great, we'll done Leicester 👏🏾   Love how people are writing off City because they lost two games against Chelsea without their key players, as the famous words go football is played on the day anything can happen.
1k comments i made it
Makes me want to be a Leicester fan. Such beautiful scenes.
The beautiful game
Late father win EPL Son win FA This is how Owner Ambition Is Football for Fans,Make The Club Become Great Banggggg!!!
My congratulations to the manager.. Brendan Rodgers... underrated very skilled manager
I wish we had this at Utd, well done Leicester 👏👏
😂😂😂 tuchel the specialis one 😂😂😂
That's brilliant 🇬🇧
That is so special for the owner and it shows the respect the whole Leicester organization has for him -would any other premiership owner have the same reception -I doubt it ! I am a Leeds fan but there is something special about Leicester and when Tuchel was interviewed after the game he lacked the courtesy to congratulate Leicester on first FA cup win as Chelsea have won it on many times. Well done Brendan Rogers and Leicester!
Amazing scenes 👏
I like to see kasper smeichel doing his thing (saving balls)
As a Liverpool Supporter, we need a owner like him ❤️
I am manutd fans and i am jealous of the owners like him.. good connection with fans, players everyone. bless them
Man this is why football is the greatest sport on earth
Just amazing today boys 🦊🙌🙌🙌🙌
Everyone but Chelsea fans wanted Leicester to win. Well done Leicester.
Glazers take a note
Arsenal fans...lol
this is man united dream
As a Bristol City fan, what a gr8 club Leicester FC are. Well played Leicester. Really impressed today.
Wow. Love to see this. Devastating learning of the helicopter tragedy years ago. Makes this even more special to see.
Great that they had fans there to celebrate with them
I has been a while since I have seen such a beautiful moment
Speechless! This moment really means a lot. Thanks from a Thai fan.
Makes me respect football again
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Glad they won but omg it was so emotional to see the chairman on the pitch hugging the players an manager so much respect for him an his dad still
Well done from a derby fan 🤝
This is respect.
That is acc amazing
As as chelsea fan. Im happy to see leicester happy. Especialy the owner.
And we have GLAZERS 😞
Daniel Ek there at 1:27 capturing what he needs to do one day when he takes over Arsenal
Wonderful, majestic, Khun Top is the best owner in the world. RIP Vichai
I’m a Chelsea fan and obviously upset - but this is what it’s about - love to see passion like this ❤️
Awww ❤️❤️
63 dislikes from Chelsea fans probably
KROENKE OUT !!!
United fan and I wish our owners were like him....they love him.  He backs the team and loves the club
Already has more trophies than Spurs
Fantastic scenes congratulations all Leicester fans 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I don't understand how anybody could dislike this video, every club in England should aspire to be like this one day. Congrats to Leicester City 👏🏿🏆👏🏿
I forgive them now for sacking ranieri.  Well done Leicester city. Well done
To see the chairman look up to the sky when city won must be one of the most heartwarming thing to see. How proud his dad would have been today to see city lift the cup. Well done Brendon & your team for making many fans dreams come true. If there is one club who deserves it then it's Leicester City 👏🦊🏆
He is getting drunk and going back home in helicopter tonight
And they want a Super League.. ⛔️
Difference is the owners loves leicester big teams owner loves revenue
Someone shut Rio please, mister contradiction
Wonderful watching the transition from quiet businessman to a dancing fan!
We need owner like Leicester’s. Absolute class people with a very good side
Leicester owners are class. Not a selling club. An example to all other clubs around the world
Classy man
Celebrated like he was a part of the team- a true Chairman
If the owners every get bored 😐 please come to WBA please
Not a Leicester fan but absolutely made up for them and there late chairman 🙏🏼
That’s fantastic to see , a real owner
So,so deserved,proper club,big boys could learn a thing or two from this club!
It is family ❤
Worthy watching filled with emotions remembering his dad.
After what the British game has been through in the last few weeks. Leicester shows us what the game is really about. Well done Leicester
This is how I feel when my team wins in Football Manager. Players know players.
Wow what a chairman with lots of passion would love to see a similar chairman at Manchester United
I wish Tottenham had owners like this 😓
What a beautiful family club ❤️🦊
Chelsea fan, but this makes me happy.
This is leadership. He knows that without everyone his investment is nothing.
This is what football is about... Leicester completely deserved this❤️❤️
Khun Top aka Fantastic Mr. Fox🦊
Such a tragedy to have lost those lives in the helicopter accident. This is great to see.
Him being so young he's just a free man he talks to every player like a friend that's what football is all about put it in mind he's just 35yrs of age and worth 4billion dollars
I’m a Chelsea fan but happy for Leicester
This is a PROPERLY run football club.
बढ़िया । देख के बहुत अच्छा लगा
Pure gold
This put a massive smile on my dial
Man that is the the most beautiful thing i've seen in a long time
Imagine Woodward  doing this
This is why we want Stan out.
How should a owner act
This brings a smile to my face what a wonderful story. So happy for Leicester supporters 😊. From a liverpool fan ❤️
Well deserved 🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏👏🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂
From their financial statement "The Club did not utilise the government’s Job Retention Scheme, retained all permanent staff and, from its own funds, continued to pay the wages of all casual matchday and non-matchday personnel to the financial year-end, despite matches being suspended between March and May. Much of the Club’s available human resource was deployed as part of a COVID-19 community response, offering personal, operational and financial support to the people and organisations in Leicester most affected by the pandemic"
This is a real connection 🦵❤️💪🤞💯 Greetings from Legia Warsaw Fan 🤞💪🦵 This is real football!!This is elite football!!!
Brandon Rogers is a class manager i hope he gets another title for Leicester 🥲
Wow. That was very special to watch. Congrats to all associated with Leicester city. They are the ones I believe will be challenging for the title next season. Well done Leicester.
Go and have a couple of pints,and everyone enjoy yourselves. Well done Leicester city. Hope the dad is" enjoying "himself ,in the heavens.  From a Man utd supporter.  Good to see success at a well run club.  All the best.
As Barca fan I love this atmosphere 😍❤ this is no just a club is family ❤💙♥
Imagine kronke 😂😂😂😂😂, he would get spun
The dislikes are from Chelsea fans😂😂
The owner would of loved to see this, R.I.P
This was just beautiful to see , this is what football should be, hopefully other football clubs owner take notes
No bad word about him and his late father, they love the club and taken the club in the right direction since they have been there
wouldn't see stan kroenke or joel glazer down on the pitch celebrating with their team
👍🏻🏆
This is absolutely mad, love it
I'm glad Leicester is soley carrying the 'romance' in modern football.
That’s what football is all about, amazing scenes 🙌🏻
Great to see owners like this. Reminds me a bit of the leeds utd owners, they also seen to be quite passionate Bout the club

As a Chelsea fan I’m upset but as a football fan I’m happy well done Leicester Good Game we go again next week 🙏
A role model owner,
Well done Leicester.
Well done Leicester City! As an Arsenal Fan, I look on and can see an owner who love his football club, aim for its success and has an excellent relationship with team and fans.
Brought a tear to my eye..proper football club
LCFC scouting team needs a round of applause

Been watching Leicester's games since the beginning of the 2020/21 premiership and i gotta say , what a team man🔥🙌🙌congrats to Leicester City.
For khun Vichai .💙🦊
From a United fan this is a great scene 👍❤️but the Glazers would never do this🤦🏾‍♂️🤬 Glazers Out !!!!!!!!!!!
Yes they deserve it
As I United fan, I’m so jealous of the setup at Leicester, and the model of ownership.  Such a shame we have blood sucking vampires instead.
Your father would be proud
I think his father is up there right now smiling down to them and I think he's pleased
We all dream to have owners like Leicester's
Big victory for the Blues
Just like the Glazers at Manutd lol
I smiled the full video
Claudio Ranieri in the backround?
Absolutely brilliant club, such a closely knit family, I wish every club could be run like this, you’d never see Dan levy or Stan kreonke acting like this, we could learn a lot from Leicester
Simply wonderful
I wish he was the owner of manchester united this was truly heart felt watching this
Meanwhile we have the freaking Glazers runing Man United.
ขนลุกเลยครับ
Great to see the passion from top to bottom 👍
Now England has a "big 7". I think we should all give a standing ovation to Leicester. They were not favorites, but they showed everyone what they are made of👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Imagine Man Utd won it glazers there on the pitch love to see that
I love Leicester 🦊 maybe I'll stop supporting Spurs and supper Leicester instead
Absolutely love this 👏👏. Wish my club (MU) had this type of bond
This is so beautiful and Leicester deserved this for sure!Man city fan 👏👏
Well done Leicester Champions league football nxt year and fa cup     Rodgers would be a mug to leave yous for any other club
Good Stuff. Congratulations Leicester!!
Such a cool club. Really pleased to see Leicester get some silverware. As a fan of football I'd love to see them win Champions League.
Arsenal fans looking at these scenes and crying  😂😂😂
As an arsenal fan I’ve always loved Leicester and I was so happy when they won
Honestly I want lesticer to win so much it might be my Secound club other than Liverpool
If only Man Utd had this connection with the owner 😢
I'm genuinely glad they won. And I hope they've dented the moral of Chelsea for the UCL against us. We'll done Leicester enjoy it and party hard. 🎉🎉🎉🎉👏👏👏
Hope leicester city don't ruin chelsea's season....Happy that they won but a loss in the epl game against them would be fatal for chelsea 😕😢
Where are the dislikes coming from?
Today was a good day Ronaldo goal Juve win Leicester win
How amazing and such a lovely touching thing to do, what a amazing caring club culture Leicester have   congratulations to everyone at the club
Damn that made me shed tears! RIP
***ผมจะซื้อทีมฟุตบอลเพื่อมาล่มเชลซี*** (สุดยอดครับ เจ้าสัววิชัย)
I'm a Liverpool fun but this moment is really heart warming❤ job well done to Leicester they deserved it and the owners connection to the team is just...incredible❤  Good job folks!!
Beautiful absolutely beautiful
Asian money buying trophies, ruining football!
True leadership. Humble. What a great story. What a great message to the so called big six owners.
Love football, one love people 🤘
Leicester are so lucky to have owners like this!
潮州粉果佬FA Cup
That is the reasons we all love the sport big up the team!😃
Congratulations LCFC!!! Cmon Chelsea
As a Boro fan I totally understand what it means to LOVE your chairman/owner! We've have ours for 35 years now and he's a local. Steve Gibson is a GOD on Teesside. Nice one Leicester!
He deserves it
Pure class
This is a wholesome moment, bless the owner of Leicester City.
THAILAND🇹🇭
Take a look at that Glazers. Proper owners not blood sucking leeches
Unlike Man Utd owner we don’t even know his face 😂😂😂
As a United fan I envy that relationship with the owners , Well done Leicester , congrats
From now on I am a Leicester fan. The emotion, bonding and respects between players and owners are so honest, so pure!
Coming out of the shitstorm of controversy over past few month, It’s so gratifying to find some solace in a complete unit between owner, management, team and fans like Leicester have shown today. Truly admirable
Who are the 45 who disliked this video? May be Chelsea fans.
ยินดีด้วยครับ
Get on with it! He died from a crash
Leicester have the most positive fan base and owners. Props to them
I'm glad he cud do this after his father's passing
Wish ManUtd owners gave a single ounce of what Leicesters owners have. All the best to the club, truly deserved !
Beautiful moment
A lot of fans would like to string their owners up. Foxes fans would carry him on their shoulders through the city.
Jeesh i wish kronke was like that
Notning but respect and love seeing this it’s not just football that’s on show it’s a family everyone can see ☝️🔥❤️
Man City fan here - But I'm so happy for them. I hope all other owners take note of what we're seeing here. "In a time where the relationship between the owners and the fans is so fractured,  To see what we're seeing here - ist's so refreshing."
Am chelsea fan this makes me smiled not gonna lie
Leicester can actually win the premier league next season they have very good squad to compete against city,Chelsea,man utd etc
Glazer left the chat
Best owners by far.
Why Leicester is good, just look at them. Good
Same owners who sacked a manager the season after winning the Premier League.
Owner.
Reminds me of uncle jack
Football needed this
As a United fan I'm so happy for Leicester they deserved it. What a great story! Fantastic owners and a top manager! Glazers out and Ole out!
Meanwhile, Kroenke didn't know what colour Arsenal wore at an FA cup final :/
Super, leadership example for unacceptable super league.
I’m a Chelsea supporter and hate that we lost but that was one of the best celebrations I’ve seen. When the owner of the club is loved by the players and staff, that means it’s a great club!
I'm so happy for Leicester  , have a  great team and a super great manager.
We've seen the best and worst of owners the last few weeks.
Leicester made what people thought was a once in a life time dream out of nothing. Then made their dreams repeat. Amazing Club
♥️♥️♥️
sooo special moment when he hugs brendan rodgers and the players, such a beautiful moment
One big happy family. His dad looking down on him.
A la mierda el Leicester
Absolutely amazing fair play to him and what is father did to leicester f.c  what a well run club👏👏
Good lord am so jealous
50+1 and investors who care, could be a wonderful future
Respect from a Chelsea fan!
Everyone’s 2nd team Leicester
As a United fan, I'm very jealous of Leicester. Look at Khun Top. He is so passionate about his club.  Man United deserve that. They deserve good owners. We hope that some day the United fans own and run our club.  Huge congratulations to Leicester City! What a club! Massive respect. 🙏❤️
I’m a Chelsea fan but hats off to this
If there was a club that we don't mind winning a title then it is Leicester City👍🏻
Wish my club was like that , well done Leicester canny emotional that 😥👌
The Glazers should watch this and be ashamed. Well done Leicester 👏
From Algeria, congratulations, Leicester, for your victory  The club that all Algerians love🤩🦊
ดีใจครับคนไทยด้วยกัน ภูมิใจมากครับ จากแฟนแมนยู
I can't see josh or stan coming near fans they will properly fear for there lives and the fans will chase him down the stadium    😆
I’m Chelsea fan and I really wanted the foxes to win this trophy well deserved
ดีใจแทนเจ้าสัวครับ
Love to see this. I hate what football has become...money money money money. I'm not a Leicester fan, but am so happy for them. Teams like Chelsea, Man City and PSG have destroyed football.
Passion. What a club. What a story!
Compare this with the toxicity that is there at certain Super League Clubs!
I’m not a Leicester fan but this was incredible to watch. They 100% deserved the win and for those 90+ mins, I was a Leicester fan cheering them on and celebrating with them from the Tv. His father is looking down from above very proudly of his son and his club. Well done Leicester City!!
Special, just special.
As a man Utd fan. I’m very happy for Leicester
Avran glazer's so j
Beautiful scenes, I can only imagine how emotional this must have been for the owner.  A lesson should  be learned here,  especially  to those owners that are only motivated by money 💰 Respect to  Leicester FC, and your many supporters 👏
🥲
And then there's United
This is so heartwarming.❤️
And anyone know the main reason that King Power Buy Leicester city is Vichai want to get football club and come to beat Chelsea and Now Leicester city Get 2 trophy by beat Chelsea in FA cup and Premier league and Chelsea give them a guard of honor
As a Newcastle fan I wish he was our owner. Well done Leicester well deserved. 🔝 club
How fantastic
First time I've got emotional watching a game of kick ball and havnt supported any of the playing teams..Absolute Quality ✌💚👊
❤❤❤❤
Brings a tear to my eye
Upset we lost a cup final but kinda happy for them
Congrats and respect from Germany 🙌🙌🙌
This is how a club should be ran. Well done Leicester! Amazing to see. From a jealous Man U fan
As a Man Utd fan..... yeah i dont need to say what im feeling. Congratulations to the owners and to Leicester, this is how a football club should be run 👌🏻👏🏻❤.
This is wonderful.
Glazers have left the chat
I'm a United fan and Im delighted for them.  I'm delighted for Brendan Rodgers
No other club is like this one! And that's why they're winning trophies that they shouldn't with how much money other teams spend on players. So great to see team work instead of buying trophies
Would the Glazers or Woodward ever do that ? ...... well greed can answer this
in few days they gonna lose top4 spot cant wait to see them celebrate only winning FA CUP clown club
Wow. This is beautiful.💙💯
Impossible not to love this, absolute class act from a brilliant club!
Free Palestine 🇵🇸❤️
Arsenal Owners should really learn something from this man and this team right here. Really, Kroenkes, learn this or sell this.
Everything Rio said here is spot on and it’s great to see Leicester do well, top club! Shame Rio will endlessly defend Mike Ashley who personifies the opposite of everything he spoke about in this clip...
If Carlsberg made football club owners...   So jealous from a spurs fan
This is football...
Coventry City fan here, we always had the kind of small bragging rights of being the last Midlands club to lift the FA Cup, and I can honestly say, we couldn't have lost that bragging right to a better club! Massive congratulations from a true Sky Blue!
Đời cha rồi đời con đều đưa leste city nâng cúp
Thank god for top and his family
Chelsea fan here. But i'm SO glad they won. I hope we win the champions league
This is so refreshing seeing a Thai owner and supporter that really cares compared to these anonymous US "investors" at other clubs!
Not going to lie it brought a tear to my eye 😅
As an Arsenal fan,  I am jealous. Man, what would we fans give to have an owner like this. Gone are the days we felt there was a belonging.   All the best to Leichester fans and their club. Great direction y'all are heading in.
Amazing
Awesome scenes. congrats to the Foxes. Well deserved. Totally jealous  of their owners.
This is beautiful
Beautiful scenes
And this is why we want the glazers out
Everything on your eyes.
The thing that rio said after 0:20 was so true, leicester as a club are the thing football has missed over the last few years.
Congratulations Leicester
brilliant to see the players with the Palestine flag aswell. Well done Leicester
Really great club, well done Leicester
Just lovely, cheers from Canada
This is why they say "football is round"
Best!!!! club in England, greetings from Germany and big congratulations!
Imho, Leicester is the most positive club in the league. No scandals, no intrigues. Just people that genuinely care, do their best, and help one another.
The owner,the players,the manager all embracing....this is real football
0:23 He lowered his head while walking pass the camera  Not even a player does that.  And he is a club owner.
WHAT A STATEMENT letting the owner lift the cup like that, Leicester are different!!
Delighted for Rodgers as a pool fan
❤️
Football is all about respect....
That is brilliant to see fair play leicester respect from liverpool fan
There's something very special about the culture in this club. Look at the owners at football matches...even hugging team members. It's so moving. A very rare glimpse into how a club should be run. Even Ngolo Kante and Ben Chilwell must have had a smile under that frown. Schmeical senior is a proud father. The team did its job did it well.
I feel like his dad ain’t dead he just chilling with Epstein and the rest of the elite who disappear I mean die
im not even a leicester supporter but just seeing the owner so happy just makes me happy he should be proud of himself and his fathers legacy will live on.
As a Liverpool fan I’m so jealous. This put a massive smile on my face.
As salty as I am this is soo wholesome
❤️
Leicester is that one guy who promised to be a great man but everybody laugh and now they dont know what to act
If only other cub owners was just like Leicester
VAR helped leicester to win FA Cup Final.  Cus the handball by perez should of been given. And chelsea equaliser should of stood to. The var did it job properly it would of been a win for chelsea or a draw extra time. Var has to stop now its ending football history and ruineing the game. Leicester has got away with this game. Lucky leicester.
Not only Leicester but football won today❤
Congratulations 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Come on Leicester.... Let's get Top 4 secured and it's an amazing season!
Glazers show yourself out 🙃
🥰
As a Chelsea fan, Leicester City and their owner fully deserved the trophy. I am touched by this emotional scene.
This is called team spirit. No racism. British or Chinese. Black or white we are all human being.
chelsea fan here i was really sad but after watching this i am kinda happy for them
This is absolutely wonderful. From a Liverpool fan. Well done Leicester. YNWA
Something city etc and all the others will never get true comrades from bottom to top what a club
Jealous Man Utd fan, all kudos to that Leicester family. All other owners should take note.
Super pour le papa bravo
Oh my god I love this!!!
I'm a Liverpool fan, and I have so much respect for Leicester Today. Well done!!
EL LEICESTER NO ES UN CLUB ES UNA FAMILIA 💙 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Stan kronke could never 😞
As a Chelsea fan I sincerely congratulate the Foxes! This scene is such a joy to watch.
As an arsenal fan I wish we had an owner like that... 😒
Leicester give me faith in football again!oxford till I die
👊🏾 goog Job guys
Congratulations to Leicester city from Manchester city fans 👍🏼
Imagine coming to Leicester for trophies😳 Harry Kane chose wrong club back in Norwich days😅
Brilliant to watch!!!
The dude is a billionaire, he already has everything in life but just look at how happy he still is to see his team win the cup. Proper fan!
โครตยิ่งใหญ่เลยครับ
It’s not just a club or money  This is family this is the true heritage of football ❤️
THIS. IS. FOOTBALL.
So beautiful moment 😭
Absolute class !!  He chose to join in and celebrate with them cause he CARES for this club. Congrats Leicester 🔵
This Leicester goal keeper is one of the most brilliant in the world. Without him the match could have ended 3-1 for Chelsea. Leicester couldn’t find their footing in the game until the last whistle. Leicester goalie was the man of the match no matter what, he is the strongest pillar of the team.
The Glazers could never
I'm sure that every football fan loves this club. A REAL football club, not a business.
Annnd chelsea lose to VAR
Congratulations to Leicester from an Inter Milan fan!
He is a top man. Him and his late father built a legacy.
Wow respect
just special. congrats to Leicester
I'm a United fan and seeing this makes my heart hurt...
As an Arsenal fan im punching the air rn
This brought tears to my eyes legit 💯
Try saying that last name after a few pints
Beautiful
Brilliant gesture 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. Imagine United fans and Avram Glazer doing this if they win the Europa League 🤣😂
This is what football is all about, how refreshing is this to see. Well done Leicester City!
Watch closely, Brendan gets what is going on. What an incredible man and what a great tribute to his father. Love this
Well done Leicester wow well done 100% respect from a Stoke city fan
As a Toon fan I yearn for this solidarity. Well done Leicester City 👍🏻👏🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
This will be a film one day.  What an era of football for Leicester right now, amazing to see.
Wish Manchester United had something like this family😢😓
Handball
How I wish Man Utd had owners like this! God!
Incredible club.
crying cos im an arsenal fan
Que lindoooo
How REAL owners should be 👏🏻 as an arsenal fan I can do nothing but speak good words about this club 👌🏻 great examples set to everyone ! This is what my club Arsenal and many others pretend and claimed to be... they are no way near this standard of lobe respect and togetherness between players fans club and community.  No one deserves this more 💥 clubs used to be families.. Leicester are a family 🙌🏻
As a Man Utd I can truly say for the first time in my life I'm jealous of another club. From top to bottom they do everything right fair play to everyone involved. These owners are the bench mark for all owners 👏🏻
I wish Mahrez stayed with Leicester.
Ah here who cutting onions
Arsenal fans here and I'm so happy for Leicester, the fans and the owner. And the players wanting to celebrate with him, what a nice gesture.
As a Chelsea fan im sad about the loss, but i can say that am also happy for Leicester, special Moment for the Club.   Well done.
This is team
Thats how it should be.
Helicopter crash victims lives matter
Wonderful scenes ❤️🙏
Congratulations Leicester. Your dad would be proud. Well done!
They deserve
ดีใจ จิ้งจอกสยาม ครองแชมป์
The 28 people who disliked as spastic salty fans 😑
Woww...what a great owner leicester got there!
Amazing! A truly great sight. A real fan who is the owner of the club, who wants go forwards with club from what his father did. Not just those BS owners like in Man U or Arsenal. Only looking for their own interest and after that, the club!
The Super League a-hole owners should take note
This is why We don't want Super League!!!
Imagine Man Utd players hugging Joel Glazer and fans chanting with pride “GLAZERS, GLAZERS, GLAZERS!!”
Wow! Now that's what it's all about and all other clubs should take note. Stand up Leicester City. Well done! From a LFC supporter.
ขนลุกเลยครับ ตอนท่านประธานกอดกับรอดเจอร์
How many owners would even be in the stadium let alone with the players on the pitch, lovely to see.
From today,my fav team is Leicester ❤️❤️
Very emotional,  and I'm a Chelsea boy
I’ve watched the prem and english clubs and football in general for the individual brilliance. From Kruyff to Ronaldinho, from Maradona to Messi, from van Nistelrooy to  bergkamp and so on. But now seeing this with Leicester.. My new favorite club
As an Arsenal fan I am so jealous of your owner. What a man. What a family. What a club. Congratulations on your first FA cup. 🏆
LFC fan - I can only wish to have an owner we'd love the same way.  Leicester FC should be proud of both their performance and how their club is run. Jealous.
as a Chelsea fan, im sad we lost today. but as a football fan, im glad that we lost to a team whose owner, staff and players have an amazing relationship. congratulations Leicester!
Absolutely incredible!! Brought a tear to my eyes. Congratulations Leicester 👏  From a United fan.
Imagine Man U players doing this with the Glazers if they win Europa League XD
beautiful stuff... well deserved :-)
An owner that cares, a rare commodity in the Premiership, most are scalping money men!
I dare kronkes to do the same
Leicester is a more "big six" club than tottenham
I'm a Liverpool fan and I still love Rodgers such an underrated manager. Congratulations Leicester 👍
I am a chelsea supporter. But I am glad for BR and his players congrats!!!
I’m not crying.
congrats  im a man utd fan so ye good game
As an Arsenal fan, I’m jealous of the bond that they have with the owner. Great scenes.
The definition of bittersweet. Vichai would have loved this moment.
Congratulations and more importantly respect to Leicester 👏👏👏 From a United fan.
I have to admit.. Im a Chelsea fan and I actually wasn't that sad that they won.. They deserved it and I'm very happy for them! 👏👏
Horrible from VAR, frame taken clearly showed that the ball was already bounced off Thiago Silva foot. Chelsea only have themselves to blame. Again the worse team won the cup.
Congrats to Leicester for winning the FA cup. They have been fantastic to watch this season. I hope Man Utd wins the Europa League.
This is beautiful
Don’t care to admit this made us shed a tear..... this is football
If i have the money, i could spend it for such a happy moment with all those amazing players. Well done Leicester.❤❤👏👏👏
Leicester Owner, Fans and Players are all goated
The dislikes omg. So annoying
So jealous of them, coming from a United fan.
Respect ✊
So jealous but beautiful to see. Top drawer in every respect! Puts the elite "top 6" Super League traitor owners to shame.
What a brilliantly run club...a jealous Newcastle fan here..Congratulations Leicester
Undeservingly win didnt deserve to win
Congratulations 💐👏👏👏
Congrats foxes
ROBBED
We made our vichai proud😍🎊🎉👏
0:24
Now i know why United fan hate Glazer so much
This is absolutely wonderful, in a time where we’ve seen the worst from football owners, this is so heartwarming ❤️ congratulations to Aiyawatt and Leicester!
That is a class act by the team
Makes me hate my team so much arsenal
Absolute class his father would be so proud of him
I am a Chelsea fan and to be honest they deserve it what a club.
The boss must be proud ! 😎
Happy for Leicester!
Our owners doesn't even know whether we're playing on matchdays.
I'm a Chelsea fan but Leicester so deserved this.  Lovely to see this video.  Well done guys.
As an Arsenal fan, I'm envious that Leicester have a fantastic owner.Congratulations
Beautiful
from a villa fan up the foxes lol
In arsenal we need this kind of owner not that badass kroanke
I felt that Chelsea were a bit cheated today with the no-handball decision, but if there is any other club deserving of this trophy, it is Leicester.
Even coming from a Chelsea fan I love the scenes
I wish United were run like that.
Great run club. Liverpool fan but respect to the Leicester family.
Only owner i have seen actually interested in the team. Fair play Leicester 👏🏾
What a wonderful day for the club. Truly well deserved and so much goodwill and heart for each other. Extraordinary day for everyone.
Great stuff, what a pleasure it has been to watch this club rise and progress with out spending billions very refreshing love to see it.
Man United comuntators are so jealous impressed that guy why our owner don't spend alot of money to wine the league
Can't believe Chelsea Fc did not win this ...
I'm a Chelsea fan but moments like this come once in a lifetime can't hate on leicster
I'd usually say the owners should keep out of it, but this is an exception - what a moving moment
As a Spurs fan just shows, what is wrong with our so called big six club, well done Leicester, your much bigger than us 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I love this owner kuhn top and I don't even support Leicester I hope they win against Chelsea again on Tuesday this was a good result for football  tho it  ain't very often the trophies are won by the bigger clubs nowadays no disrespect to Leicester? 😁😁
I wish the Arsenal owner was like this man :(
Even as an LFC fan, this almost made me tear up when it happened. Well done Leicester 🙌🙌🙌🙌
Congratulations Leicester City 👏 & Brandon Rodgers 👏 Love from Spain 🇪🇸
IM CHELSEA FAN BUT IM HAPPY FOR LEICESTER BECAUSE ITS STUPID BE FAN ONLY ONE TEAM..SO IM FAN OF MINIMAL 100 SPORTS TEAMS :-) WELL LEICESTER :p
Respect mate.
Congrats Leicester
proper class. Congratulations from a Toon fan.
i dont know why i am smiling so wide watching this. anyone else? i'd love to see this kinda love and connection in arsenal fc.
As a Newcastle fan, I so wish we had this in terms of a owner that cared. Honestly if we ever won the FA Cup the city would just be one long party for at least a week and it would be one of the best memories ever.
Hmmm glazers
Respect Leister. Great club YNWA.
That why we need European super league. Doesn't need this mini team who can't make profit disturbing flow of money
I’m italian. Never seen an owner hugging his players in my entire life. This is really how football should be
Arsenal need owners like this
Leicester are the best team in the Premier League I'm so proud that they won against Chelsea
As a United fan it leaves me mystified to see fans that love their owners, I could be watching a sketch from Harry Enfield and chums.
Leicester club genuinely runs for the passion of Fans ,supporters and spirit of the game .Hail leicester 💙💯
Has anyone seen Jason Cundy!
คิดถึงรอยยิ้ม คนบนฟ้า  🇹🇭❤️
The beautiful game at its best
Guys i love these club
Leicester have the best owner ever
Brilliant guys. Well done
The Fox
Amazing wish we had that at MUFC
Call me a front runner, but I can’t help feeling myself slowly becoming a Leicester fan.
Beautiful,  so emotional 😪
Beautiful to see
If Leicester were invited to the Super League, imagine how upset Aiyawatt would feel at that proposal
I never ever see anything like this club Players, Fan, Owner Celebrates like this one!!  Congratulation to the Foxes 🦊 from Manu fan👍
🇹🇭🇹🇭💙
👎👎👎👎👎
That handball leading to a goal :))))))
This is how an owner of football club should be.  Love it.
As a Chelsea fan I can’t even hate💙
Well..all we can do is envy..❤️
How much did they pay?
Next is the Champions League
ดีใจมากครับ 🇹🇭❤️
Great occasion and result.
Respect Leicester City !
As a Chelsea fan it's really nice to see Leicester winning it. Especially they way they have got the owner involved in the celebration is amazing. Its like one big happy family
Congrats to Leicester City...proud to support them and live in the city. Well done peace and love.
Must feel great
Me watching as a Newcastle fan... 👁️👄👁️
Beautiful to see, absolute magic.
Rio is spot on.
Im a united fan and i envy them...
I wish arsenal 😂😪
Was gutted to see brendan leave us but happy for him and this leicester team  its good to see how much it means to the player's everyone involved at Leicester proper fans 👏
This is football❤
Wow. Just wow 👏
Oh my God! As an Arsenal fan, I am crying right now.
I'm welling up watching this
I think more teams need to see this interaction with their owner. Nothing like the vulture looking cretin at Manchester United.
So jealous as an Arsenal fan to see an owner that actually cares & loves the club..
Lucky chap @owneratLFC
Honest club , which what football is all about well done Leicester....
U cant find this fairytail on ESL
United fan and im really jealous of the owners , why can't the rest be like this, its beautiful to see , well done Leicester
Chelsea fan here - gutted to have lost. But Leicester were the better side today  I can't say I was dry eyed when I saw this - what a great moment for a club that has reignited our love for this game
Well done Leicester. Fully deserved 👏👏
Chelsea got robbed.
This is so wholesome!
This is so sweet
Clearly man utd owner is better than him
Wholesome
Never seen a less deserving team
I'm an arsenal fan and I want this sooooo bad
This is so beautiful omg im crying lfc fan GLAZERS ARE U WATCHING
Beautiful. I don’t support LCFC but this made me teary eyed
Happy for Rodgers and the team. Liverpool Fan
Damn I'm not even a Leicester fan but this hit hard and so humble with everything going on there are chairman's who care 👏
Scored after a handball, then got a shoulder offside
His father is a big fan of the Chelsea team. But there was one game, they traveled to Chelsea at the stadium. That day, the officer at the Chelsea stadium Made bad manners to his father, after which they made a promise We will buy a team in England. And will come to get revenge on Chelsea And that day has arrived.
Lets not forget all the times Malcolm Glazer did a lap of honour of Old Trafford with the premier league trophy
This is very wholesome
This is the spirit of football....
สุดยอดครับผมดีจัยมากๆที่ได้แชมครับ ยินดีด้วยครับ
It’s only fa cup guys😂
Leicester are my second team
We knew Leicester would win before kick off. Listen to everyone
Chelsea fan here- really emotional but fair play to the son who is living out a proud legacy for Leicester football club
This what an owner should be like it's so wholesome
Who has been cutting onions ffs
It's not a  team it's a family i got jealous of that owner  literally and congratulations Leicester  well done
Congrats from Thailand 🇹🇭
Great moving moment and well deserved title. Happy for Leicester!
They back their managers Rio? Claudio R might beg to differ..
As a Spurs fan, I'm not only jealous of the silverware but that relationship the players have with the manager and they both have with the owner....priceless!
I wish we had this at Arsenal 😿
Beautiful to see
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Amazing scenes 🙏
Glazers and Kroenke take a look mate !!!!!
we Arsenal fans DREAM to have an owner like this. congratulations Leicester, u man deserve it!
Congrats to Brendan Rodgers and Leicester!
thai lad jacket on freezing in this summer weather lol
From top to bottom nothing but class from Leicester I hope u get the celebration u deserve on returning home and enjoy it people
Please buy Manchester United🙏
Great to see
Mint ❤
This whole game was amazing but the scenes here with the fans and the owner were emotional 🙏😢
Bet every Man Utd fan is jealous after this 😂😂😂
I wish Glazers they were watching this.
Well said Rio..
Amazing this is da way to own a club connect with da fans,players n everyone involved
How much did he pay the ref / var?
Did anyone notice how the chairman was talking to them personally like he have a relationship with everyone
total respect from a west ham fan what football is all about
As Benfica fan i would like to say Congratulations to Leicester from winning the First FA Cup Title hope they can became Champions League Team just to doing pretty points down there
another one for the best moment in football list.
Seeing this makes me seriously doubt whether to continue supporting my money grabbing team. Leicester do everything he right way, with owners who genuinely care about the game and it’s fans. Shame on all the so called big teams.
As an arsenal fan i could only dream of an owner like this.. Respect to that man
This team spirit is on another planet
This is special to see it in 21st century  football,   some club owners  dont even know  the offside rule  🙄
Congratulations 🎉
Myself and my dad are liverpool fans but were both tearing up seeing this today, can’t knock what him and his dad have done for the club. He’d be looking down on him being proud on what they’re doing with the club, great owners. Well deserved win today for them.💙
Leicester City should be in the top 6 club not Spurs tbh
Big amount of respect from a Leeds fan. Love to see a club that isn't top 6 be so successful. Much love Leicester fans, well deserved
Magic. Just magic.
damn i didnt expect to almost be crying when i clicked on this video
What a beautiful moment
Everyone's 2nd team
I’m honestly so jealous, this is the most amazing thing ever omg
The Glazers would never.
how wonderful is this.....best face of football ive seen in a long time...and rather than one of the really big clubs showing how its done, its left to leicester to do it....this is great for the game...
Total class well done Leicester and congrats Khun, how an owner should act ! What a well run club !
Such an emotional moment in football history. Really happy for everyone at Leicester City football club, fully deserved this so congratulations 👏 from a Man U fan.
They done that for his dad he would love it  congratulations Leicester well deserved YNWA
What a guy what a chairman he derserves that and I'm supporting a club which owner is Daniel levy who is an absolute idiot 😢
Leicester absolutely deserved this ❤️
Congrats to Leicester! Outstanding Performance once again!  Well deserved and very heart warming to see!   All the best wishes from Liverpool!
If it had to be any team I'm so glad it's leicester
Wish all owners and stuff were like this absolutely amazing to see
Love the amazing connection
Proud for Leicester And Just 👏 For Rogers amazing Season I’m City Fun But I respect Leicester
What a club... I mean I have nothing else to say but respect to Leicester City football club and their commitment to progress years after years. Wise recruitment, engaged owners, brilliant coach and dedicated players with what looks like a passionate fan base.
How great is to see a team out of the "big 5" (Spurs can't be considered a big team) winning a title like this, and even better knowing they are so close of qualifying to the next UCL.
Kroenke>
Funny how Stan Kroenke wasn't at the game where Arsenal won the FA cup
This is beautyfull !!
Great to see. So happy for Leicester. Imagine Kroenke doing this
Lmao GLAZERS in the next 50 YEARS
Why can't man united be like this my God
Well done Leicester great victory. Well deserved and that’s coming from an Arsenal fan
Love that!!!!!!!
Well done Leicester.   As a Liverpool fan I'm happy to see Brendan Rodgers  doing well.
❤️🇹🇭
Congratulations Leicester , brilliant scenes at the end
Can't picture Glazers doing this...
So pleased Leicester won this, the manager, players all deserve it for their outstanding performances.❤ Couldn't listen to chelski fans bang on about winning it.😂
Best owner in the English game by far
Respect 🙏🏻
Gratulationer from Sweden
What an owner, god bless the whole family after all the pain they've been through. What other owner comes on the pitch celebrating with the players. Had me teary eyed, Amazing Scenes this is how a football club should be run 🙏🙏🙏
Wow this club is run by Asian congratulations to leciester city.
What a great football club
Can this guy buy Arsenal pls?
The owners giving the game to the fans.
This is what we need for every club, specially United.
me dreaming of MAN UTD FANS celebrating with glazer😂👌🤦‍♂️
This amazing. Good form Leicester
As a Chelsea fan, I'm happy for this guy. What a character!
Leicster's owners are a prime example of how football club owners should be. Passionate, loyal, great investors and loved by the fans. I wish our owners would take advice from them.
This is what good owners are say that to the glazers🤣
Big congratulation.i wish your team very good outting.a precious jewel for leicester.
truly jealous about how this club is run. congrats
Still bitter as a chelsea fan but this is lovely❤️
Making Thai people proud with his handling of the football club.  He really loves football and is passionate about it- that is the difference from some owners.  Definitely deserves this happiness after the tragedy that occurred.
Well, and at least Chelsea gets a good warm up on losing finals in preparation for the next one.
Well done Leicester city as a Manchester United I wish we had owners like your that actually love the club with passion and have a vision and stand behind clubs values and put money into the club not take it out to line there pockets like the Glazer's
Arsenal owners should be ashamed of themselves
Why can’t all our clubs owners be like that😭
I am a United fan and can only wish for a bond this special with our owners. Done themselves proud today well done Leicester 👏
Well done .... very proud of your club owners and fans well done
This is a club that deserves to win trophies. The owner,  manager,  and players are in the same page.
I feel v happy for the Leicester
GLAZERS OUT!!!!!!  🔴big up the foxes  🦊  love seeing this 🔵
Beaty
Sooooo is the FA cup an important cup again?
As a Manchester United fan looking at the clear bond and respect between the owners of Leicester city,the manager,the players and the fans I completely agree with Mr Shearer...that is how a football club should be run!!!   Congratulations to everyone involved.
what a baller, jealous as an Arsenal fan
From championship to one of the biggest club in Europe  Much respect 💯
I can confirm Leicester are my second favourite team in England
Not a fan and was trying not to shed a tear.
Not a single negative comment. That just about sums up the respect and admiration football fans from all clubs have for Leicester.
We have missed this a real game with Fans watching...this was just great ... the family of football at its best.
Well done Leicester City
Just wow !!!!
This is just fantastic to see! The American run clubs should take serious note! Hope they feel ashamed of themselves when they see this, though I doubt they will! Well done Foxes! As a Gunner I am jealous but also super happy as this is a club that's going places and deservedly so! THIS is what football is all about and not a banknote in sight!
Big up Leicester
Absolutely beautiful 👌
great to see after the tragedy of his father, great stuff
Maybe the most loved owner in the premier league  Even though Abramovich did the same when chelsea won cl
I think everybody wanted Leicester to win no matter what team we support... apart from Chelsea 😯
Congrats Leicester
Arsenal owners please learn some thing
I’m a Man Utd fan but i’ll admit it was emotional at full time to see Top look up to the sky for his dad. This is how owners of a football club should be, he’s absolutely adored by the fans and players, hope he celebrates well tonight 💙
This guy > yanks + Saudis combined
This was so wholesome  Respect to Leicester Football club and the owners and the fans!
Wish somebody would stop cutting onions right under my eyes. Christ that was emotional and im not even a Leicester fan.
Goated
Well done Leicester that's what a proper owner is man united should take example of him
What a club
This is a beautiful story.🥰
Not even a Leicester fan but that brought a little tear to my eyes. So nice to see the owner embraced like that.
This is football ⚽️
Best thing for football
Well deserved
So happy for Leicester and Top they deserved it
Most of us are not even Leicester fans but we were supporting them tonight because of how much they have progressed throughout these years. Also, Rodgers is underrated.
i am not even a supporter of this team but i loved watching this - the commentator was right u won’t see many owners doing this generally happy for the win and can tell it means so much to the owner and the team well done Leicster city!
Are there actually people who dislike random YouTube video's just to be different? sad.
Genuine affection from players and manager to an honourable owner. Credit to the Premier league
I’m a United fan an fair doose to Leicester this is how every club an owner should be
I wish the club i support was run like this, we probably all do, its so great to see
A very special club. This is how foreign owners should interact with the fans. Man utd, City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool need to go.
Football man. Even when everything's going bonkers in the world, this beautiful game continues to find ways to warm your heart.
I watched this and near on brought a tear to my eye. Leicester City should be very proud to have owners that care for the club first.
this is what i call a proper football club well done guys
Well done Leicester, fully deserved & a well run club, even as a mutual fan I love to see this.
Well done Leicester, from a Chelsea man. Thoroughly deserved
The best owners in the country by far. They built the greatest era in living memory for that club but did not steal the limelight and prefer working with, rather than on top of, the club.
If Joel Glazer or John W Henry tried to touch a trophy he'd be booed away from it, just shows what proper ownership does to a club's infrastructure when everyone knows everyone instead of the owners hiding away in their mansions in the US whilst players and managers try to do their best to increase the values of these Americanised franchises rather than working class Football Clubs
I am a Chelsea fan but don't be fooled about the match against Real Madrid. Chelsea barely will get the 4th place. It has a weak manager and very average players. Afterall, they lost to Arsenal twice. Yuck!
Vicai is smiling in heaven right now. Leicester City is a gift that keeps on giving.
Meanwhile korenke rejecting offer from daneil ek saying he doesn’t need money and later provide a transfer budget of 15 million and 20 bundles of rice
Amazing club..
Arsenal please learn from them

Well done Leicester!!
No super league can top this
🦊🇹🇭
Absolutely love it!
Imagine the glazers celebrating😆😆
Every club in world football should be jealous of this ownership
Arsenal fans meanwhile crying somewhere in corner.
This is what football is all about 🏆
Spurs fan delighted to watch this. So emotional for the chairman and all involved.  Great day for football
After all that happened with the European Super League to see an owner hugging the manager and celebrating with the players is so refreshing and lovely to see. If only all clubs were ran the way Leicester is.
I sometime wonder if I should switch supporting Leicester, or another club where the owner is not just about take take take and not give anything back
Hoping the Arsenal players and the Kroenke's family are watching this
And arsenal got kroenke

as a united fan im so jealous looking at leisters relationship with the owners also i believe their scouting network is the best in the world
As an Arsenal fan. I’m so jealous of this owner. He actually showed up to games....
Best club bond in the EPL🔥
Arsenal fan here and this is amazing, the kroenkes are nothing compared to Leicesters owner
Zero dislikes.
Congratulations to the FOXES 🎊🎊

I love Khun top 🇹🇭
This is beautiful. Every club owner should have this type of connection with the staff, players & fans. Sadly the top club owners are pretty much anonymous for the most part
Its 1.2K likes with 0 dislike   Fockin beautiful

i love to see owner coming and celebrating with players. I am a united fan. Congratulation Leicester city and fans.
What a moment
Simply beautiful.... I was tearful about the emotion about Top and how he’s continued his fathers dream....I thankyou as a foxes 🦊 fan...and the super genuine Thai peoples.
So pleased for top .the hug from vardy ❤️
An owner that cares wow
Kroenke would never
Vichai would be proud.
What a brilliantly ran club, Manchester United and Arsenal wish they had owners like theses
When owners give their managers their time, the backing or whatever they need, they become successful!
Love Leicester .. what a proper club. Almost wish the muppet six did do 1 into the Super League so Leicester could dominate the Prem
wish the kroenkes cares like this for arsenal
Glazers should learn from him.
Let's be fair. This owner did not run on the pitch to celebrate. Kasper went and found him and got him onto the pitch. This would not happen voluntarily at other premier league clubs. It shows a respect for the owner but also an understanding and a liking for the owner.
Leicester is a club that no one hates
This is what every football club should aspire to be like.
Beautiful
🔵🔵 for Vichai  🔵🔵
Dean Smith out
A proper club! Loved watching this today. Feels like football is back!!
The Kroes could NEVER!
This is actually amazing
Amazing
This is blueprint!

This guy celebrates with the team  while kroenkes whereabouts is unknown when arsenal fight for titles
🇹🇭❤️
Andrea Radrizzani at Leeds would be lauded by his players in a similar manner...... Can't think of many others though....

Absolutely wholesome
Arsenal need to see this..💯

Congratulations 💐& Heart touching moment 💙
This is so wholesome, I am a Chelsea fan and I was gutted but this is just emotional, hopefully this can wake up other less nice owners
Well chuffed for the foxes.  A Chelsea fan
Leicester deserves to be in champions league❤️
🙏🙏🙏🙏🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🤟❣️❣️
I'm a united fan and I love this! Brilliant
รักเลสเตอร์
Emotional!! Love to see this 🙌🏾
This is what is missing in riches clubs like Man Utd , Man City , Liverpool … owner is so close with team ! 🙏
Get to da choppa!
Imagine the Glazers walking out if Man U win the Europa cup! (not that they even care enough to even be at the stadium...prob not even enough to watch on TV) Their own fans would prob throw rocks at them!
Makes a happy and optimistic as a Man United fan seeing that; there actually are owners who love the club as much as players/fans ❤
really good to see. His father would be so proud.
I haven’t watched a full 90 minutes since 2012 or so but I did today and I am glad I did. I had that feeling I used to have back then when united won the premier league and Chelsea finally won the champions league.
Love to see this was backing Chelsea to win but leister deserve it still making story's everyone loves to see how a football club should be run truly lovely to see 👏
Couldnt imagine kroenke doing this
Incredible, scenes like this make football the greatest sport in the world
As an Arsenal fan, its's so beautiful to watch. This is how I want my club ran.
Alan Shearer summed Leicester City up “how a football club should be run”. So so true!!!
I'm not a Leicester fan, but there was something wonderful about seeing how much it meant to everyone both on and off the pitch
Leicester is not a football club, it's FAMILY! Really great gesture by the Team, to have their chairman join the celebration
So sad that his father isn't there to see this, but I'm sure he'll always be with Leicester in spirit. Best club owners in England for sure... it's rare for owners to be so utterly adored by the fans.
It’s amazing seeing such a well run club finally getting something they deserve. Really emotional watching this
Awww, how sweet. 😊
Refreshing to see
Much love Leicester 💙
Take note all greedy big 6 owners. Im a united fan. Leicester have the best owners in the world by a clear mile. Congrats to an incredible club. Rip vichai hes smiling today.
A proper people club. Well done Leceister from a Wolves fan.

Well done Leicester!
This is quite a lovely scene ❤️
Every club needs an owner like him
Beautiful well done boys.
This is what football’s all about ❤️
I'm a Chelsea fan and I got emotional watching this. Too much emotion for one day
God bless Vichais son. Great to see a owner emotionally invested in the club. This will mean the world to him after his fathers passing.  Congratulations to Leicester.
Lesley chow ain’t it?
