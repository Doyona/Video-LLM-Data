There's no point om personalize a car you can't buy at the end
c6 z06 front bumper was different than the c6 non z06 front bumper fyi. the opening is bigger
Beautiful car. Im such a corvette guy. My lady said i can now get one..oh man, whats she wanting... lol.  Lord help me
Still a Chevy. 🤮
Was ist das denn für eine hässliche Krücke!?!?
*WHEN WILL DOUG REVIEW A C3?*
Why would you go for convertible,  for 8 more thousand,  when you can't see the engine.?????????...with the coupe,  you see the engine, and you can still remove the roof!!!!????!!!???
I don't like it...looks like a baby lambo... Sorta dumb
It's like getting a 458 with enough leftover for a Denali. Chevy=win
My Hello’s 🎉🎈
i ve never liked american cars, until the C8.
It would be real funny if you were cussin like just throw a fuck or shit in there
Sounds like a Mercedes amg gt
That color is gross
Horrible cockpit.
Take a shot every time Doug says Z07.
From what i see its only RWD - thats really bad, just from this little detail, i would not buy it.
If u watch his new video or u know anything about it, it will not rev past 3000 sitting still. So all yall saying it dont have a limiter, yes it does.
These people are seeing brand new cars hours after they come out that they normally wouldnt see, and they still aint pleased and talk shit, be happy the mans taking his time to show his passion to us all
2.5 thats Koenigsegg Jescko time, tahts fast
Twenty twenty three not 2 thousand 23 ugh!
These look nothing like Corvettes.  I thought it was some other company’s new supercar.
Engine sounds like a piece of crap
corvettes are still ugly they should probably fix that
I don't like Corvettes, and this one looks like the McLaren Arturo.
i ride on the bus to work
I CAN DO ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST WHICH STRENGTHENS ME   PHIL 4:13
REPENT FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND TURN FROM SIN AND TURN TOWARDS RIGHTEOUSNESS THROUGH CHRIST JESUS   JESUS CHRIST IS COMING BACK SOON AND WE MUST BE READY FOR WHEN HE COMES BACK
i don't understand the c and z in corvette.
My everyday sportscar!! Brilliant job Doug.
This car model or the c8 regardless, they did the worst exterior body design ever, looks like the Camaro - the worst design ever made with the worst tail lights … I mean add some curves to the rear and instead of being wide straight and flat…. Use the original round tail lights - signature of corvette, lower the car more from the back, add some cool blades aero dynamics —- there is a lot of work tto be done, even the front of the car, we don’t see a sports exotic car look:.. the trunk is uglyyyyy. Change that failure who ever changed the round tail lights …. Older models looked more like agressive round and beautiful
Doug:  Love your work.  Do not love your artificial over the top emphasis in your speech pattern.  Please go back to sounding  like a real human being.  This is annoying.
all cars look alike these days. lmao im picturing someone subtle removing the gm badges and putting these little pony or bull badges instead and only a few people notice.
20:02,seamana foarte bine cu sigla masinii
2023 Ganggg
IMO the most notable feature from the rear is the centered exhaust pipes, not the width.
X
Awesome tour of the Z06, thanks Doug.  Are you going to do a driving review of this particular model?
4:51 Doug the type of guy that isn’t allowed to drive a “preproduction” car but than shows tires with obvious signs of major rubber loss. 😊
En el momento que está hablando y dejala la parte de enzima del motor donde identifica quien lo constituye a mano ✋ hay 2 tornillo derecho y izquierda ..El derecho está Rudy del. El centro compara el izquierdo ..creo que es un buen punto de ocser acción...
Hey bro plz 760 Audi Quattro amcran car review plz
Please stop flailing your arms around I want to see your car they're cool I want to follow it.
Is this the stradman zo6
So Cool https://youtu.be/oL2nSvCN2RY?t=873
i cant even imagine how much power the ZR1 will have
I love the new Corvette such an awesome new design.  Everythng except that ugly side vents WTF looks ugly as hell!!!
Is it me or the wheels look a bit cambered inwards
Wait this video is a year old already.
I can't wait to see one.
I am now a corvette guy because of this car. so beautiful. well done chevy
Please change the wing, it’s an eyesore!
Why did he take 2 minutes talking about how huge the rear wing is?
Lambovette
I dont like it dougie its looks like a cheep american car dressed up like a ferrari, but with the same paint they use on malipoos, its a fast car but so are all of cars nowa days sorry doug its trash.
It needs Lamborghini style Aventador scissor doors and also I don't like the fact that those rims and tires sit inside the fender well they need to at least be right even or a little past the fender well in the back and right even with a fender well in the front. Instead they've got them sitting inside the fender which makes the car not look as aggressive
2023!
Argh … typical American car , looks like a pig and drives like one too lol😅
I had a dream you made a C8 ZO6 follow up video.
This is my older brothers dream 😂
Can't wait til i own one
Can’t wait to get mine been saving for 2 years and on a 2 year waitlist I got on 6 months ago
Hi Doug, please do a review on the C8 Z06 test driving it. I respect your input like no other reviewer!
Doug is awesome in his reviews and analysis
A Masterpiece that took a century❤ The numbers are remakable not the HP👌 From an engineers perspective that is👌 The BMEP numbers are exactly the same as the Aston Martin Valkyrie (Cosworth V12 1000HP 6.5 L ) $3M USD Machine👀 Mind Blowing💥
Love your energy buddy. Thx
This whole video is a bunch of made up BS propaganda. If you notice in every other honest review he makes fun of something or knock something down that he doesn't like... I wonder how much he got paid for this commercial. Cuz we all know it wasn't an actual review. I hate to say the words but here it is..  I'm disappointed.
The C9 Corvette is going to be quite something.
When are you going to drive it? Tons of people have now. Also the manual Supra?
We all love Doug ! But he is the type of guy who would fart when no body is around and say " excuse me "
Hi! Do a review on Acura RSX TypeS or Honda Integra DC5 please. I'm a fan of this model from Russia, I watch your videos and admire.
the best valuable sports/ performance car ever to come out a US brand. 👏🏻 👏🏻 🇺🇸
What does it mean Z06 with 207 package? Will a 207 C8 release later?
doesnt feel right for chevrolet to build cars this fast
Doug… you mentioned that the Z06 is faster than a C8 from 0-60, I think you meant quicker.
Price?
Why that “This” sounds so familiar
chevy has let me down when it came to my last truck, but this Corvette is freaking phenomenal!!!
The flap looks way better
6:18 nice orange peel
Now I could own a Corvette...This interior feel so cocoonish and cozy comfy.
I cannot wait to see the zr1c8 if they ever go that far
If the Z06 already looks this insane, hows the ZR1 gonna look?   A ZR1 and potentially a Grand Sport could still happen in the future
They won't let you drive it, but the tires are bald as hell.
Only the privileged and the wealthy will be the first ones to get their hands on the C8 ZO6s! There will be scalping!
so disappointing.......
wow
A masterpiece.. I have been blown away by GM the last 2 years. Making America proud again
Are the deranged, anti-fossil fuels, climate change, kool-aid drinkers going to force a change to electric corvettes?
Questions - is the Aero package included in the ZO7 package? Can you buy the Aero package only without the ZO7 package?
I don't love the try hard design language
looks even better than the lexus lc 500
😆😆 THIS!! Shirt Kills Me! lol
Naturally Aspirated😍😍😍
What's up with the yellow highlighter paint job?
Only cars worth buying these  days are these vette or porsche. if some one wants to buy me one or the other then THX. i don't care for super expensive cars..........But i would love a sesto elemento
WOW, yellow on this car looks like  .......................💩💩💩💩💩💩
Unfortunately I can’t drive the Z06…unfortunately I can’t watch the rest of the video. You’ve spoiled us too much, Doug. Lol
Don’t let Henry Riggs see this car
Imagine put a widebody on a already *wide* c8 😂
breaking : The C8 ZR1 will have a naturally aspirated V10 making 800hp
Wait... The normal C8 Corvette has a 6.2L N/A V8 with 495hp And this one is 5.5L (smaller) still N/A but with 670hp ?? I just thought they'd fit turbos on the base engine o_o !
Just hit my limit of Doug DeMuro.  His voice is now fingernails on a chalkboard.
the z06 c8 looks so much better than the regular c8
💖💖💖
And its a 106k
The c8 zo6/7 is pretty much 10 years late, Ferrari did this a decade ago with the 458 speciale
That Go Hard 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Thanks!
Can wait to get my hands on one
It sounds like hell.
I live in KC went downtown this weekend and saw one of these on the street it was blue with black accents, it was freaking beautiful
Wow yellow seat belts I love that
It's over raided
I reckon the C7 is better
It’s July 2022 and he still hasn’t driven it yet.
How many times can you say cars and bids Doug: yes
Why The why is the corvette so much cheaper than the lights of a lambo?
2:52 looked like a simulation
Easy on the coffee
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Well Done 🎯
4:10 I gotta disagree, the most noticeable difference is the exhaust tips
Man couldn't talk if he had to stand still.  🤣
this car made me hard
DOUG IN CANADA THE C8 IS SELLS AMAZING
👱🏻‍♂️ANDDD
z06 prices just dropped today 🥲
The sound of this V8 engine reminds me of Ferrari but it still sounds like a Corvette. I love it!
Doug is like the Sheldon for cars
Too bad no easy online system to submit an order. Ridiculous dealership BS..
This car is definitely beautiful but the pricing markups just kill it for me
I want one or two
Still an old fart car.
If only it had fine Corinthian leather
Hope Chevy isn't pinning their future on this . This body design mod  is aesthetically unappealing except to those looking for purely race car level performance. are we looking at the same video?
OO MEN !! can't wait to the the 2nd part of this seriously tho...
Doug what's up with the Chevy Silverado electric?
Nothing very much 😏
If this is the Z06, then god knows what they’ll do with the ZR1.
Yeah looks like dog sh#t...
It must be manual transmission
doug puts more energy into saying "THIS" than I put into my life
Any one want to buy a 1960 corvette
Any one want to buy a 1960 corvette
Omg what language was that
BMW I8 or am I tripping?
I don’t know what Doug’s personal issues are with GM, but he’s way too concerned about profit and speculative whenever he’s reviewing their products. Offering customers the customization options is about making more money off of them? That’s so stupid.  I’ve never heard such a asinine comment come from Doug while reviewing a Mercedes-Benz or Porsche. Then he further speculated by stating they dumbed down the Z06 to push folks to the more expensive range topping Z07 equipped Z06 - and talks about how true that could be. It also could not be true. Maybe Chevrolet just wanted to offer options for every customer. The standard Z06 certainly looks very different from the Stingray and it’s the trim I would choose.
korea in sell please
THISSSSSS is the Devel 16, but not just any Devel 16. This is a devel 16 with a V8 and body from a corvette C8 minus the turbos.   The Devel 16 is literally one of these with turbos lol
Getting one in 2025
Okay this model is a lot more original it has some Ford GT touches but doesn’t scream Ferrari 488 like the last one but still ugly as spoiler 😂 can they hire someone else that can actually design a nice spoiler for this thing, it looks like something I would put on my Honda Civic in NFS or GT7 or bootleg cars in GTA5
This takes the regular corvette to the next level.  beautiful.
Isn't the convertible's rigidity just the standard rigidity if there's no standard hardtop?
The track oriented features are nice but if I had a C8 I would take to the open road. I'm from Canada so I will make some suggestions for our summer visitors with a great handling car. # 1 The Cape Breton Highlands, great twisty roads and stunning scenery. The Eastern Shore of Mainland Nova Scotia again great twisty roads and views. The South Shore is being twinned but great fun 2 lane roads exist along the Lighthouse route. Canada's Maritimes have some great four lane 100 Series Highways and the twisty highways that preceded the 100 Series. Truly a hidden gem for many people and a great spot to drive. Much more challenging and visceral than the track.
Generally speaking I'm a Ford fan, with this one exception. Love the C8.
How much did Chevy pay you for this sales video?
Only Doug goes into the future 😎
I just saw this same car in California.  It has a stealth option for interior pieces making some trim like speakers, a darker color.
Beautiful!
That thing literally purrrrrrs 😻
This thing looks like a freaking hot wheels car. Love it.
How many tracks are there where you can drive it at 180?
I never liked the zo6 design n yet they still brought that to the 2023. And to add it has no stick shift... manuals are preferred finish for real car enthusiasts...  automatics are female excuses
345 in the rear.  OK Viper.
Ultra MAGA Sports car. 🇺🇸🦅
is it still a pushrod v8?
Awesome vid, still don't get exactly why the wing dips down in the middle. Does anybody know? Thanks.
🤯
Doug describing the rear end width is like me after meeting a new girl: "it's 3.6 inches....that's almost FOUR!"
I love this car! Im extremely happy how it turned out being a life long Corvette fan.
Oh, great. Another thing to buy when I win the lottery.
Hey Doug those tires are shot😂
It seems like doug was paid to say good things about the c8 zo6 because its rare to see Doug say good things about a car😂
wow cool he travelled to the future just for us
Color changes with and witout Doug in shot.
How do you get in?
It should be available with a 3.8-litre V6 and a larger trunk. Probably turbocharged.
Impressed with corvette.. this car is practically a super car now
why is the color changing from frame to frame?  One second the yellow is washed out, the next it's super bright (better)
A confused and babbly review. Unstructured, all over the place.
wow
banana color  \
If this car had an Italian badge on it people would be saying it was the second coming.
anyone else finds this cars front looks like a symbiote from spiderman@2:42...anyone? oh just me
I'll buy one when we get to 0 - 60 in under 1 second.
This sold for 3.5 million at Barrett Jackson’s
What’s up with this videos ? Looks faded out such a shame
I'm waiting for the all wheel drive hybrid....wont have as much horsepower but an awd is the way to go with a vette....1 rear naturally aspirated powering the rear wheels and 2 front electric engines powering the front wheels
Just figured out what the C8 looks like. It looks like a wasp.
Sorry, I think they're ugly.  Too much going on with the design.  If I'm going to buy an American sportscar, I'm going Mustang or Challenger.   Corvettes have never really done it for me from a design standpoint and this one just looks gaudy.
it looks ugly
Whats the point of having a car this nice when the center console is so big i cant get my dick sucked in it
Those climate controls 😒
Are you Italian?
Faster N/A than F1
good job, Doug!
18:20
If Chevy would’ve kept the round taillights it would’ve been much nicer and improved the rear end and looked much more like Ferrari
They way to higher revs is the dual overhead cams which I don't believe Doug mentioned.  My previous Range Rover would rev to at leatst 7K with it's 4.2L DOHC Jag motor.  I realize GM is making a big deal about the flat plane crack and it does help.  Also,  GM has been offering lot's of interior customization for decades.  Apparently Doug has not seen the option list for a standard C8.  I have one on order and I can tell you it's extensive.  You do have to go up in trim level to get some options.  In my case I went to 3LT in order to get a dash that is not black.
What a stupid car!
I like that the front looks like a bee or hornet face with those headlights design.
its still made by GM just as bad as ford.
Doug, about the floating exhaust. Yes, it does change the exhaust note. Floating exhaust pipes essentially turn themselves into tuning forks shifting and vibrating with the engine independently or semi-independently from the chassis. If they secured them to the rear of the car, the exhaust note would sound more “hollow” (think bmw M2 or a Jag with the flat ass).  But for a more “throaty” sound, you’d allow the exhaust to suspend.
C8 vette, Z07 package, Z06 corvette, 5th year, 4 wheels, 3 extra inches, 2 seats, and 1 doug demuro
Idk how to feel about it missing that muscle v8 muscle car sound 🥹
Yeah it’s nice and all, but does it have a back seat?
this!
Did this guy give the price wtf
those brakes O.O
How many quirks and features does Doug DeMuro have?
Should've  slanted muffler tips
Doesn't look like a vet but man is it pretty.
While I’m not the biggest fan of General Motors, I seriously love what they’re doing with the C8!
I love the design, but that color is killing me😉.
Too bad it’s only a Chevy.
Nice !!!!!!
3:57 Ugh... For the past 10 years the rear end of corvettes have been awful. 🤮  Everything is great, gorgeous, absolutely beautiful until you notice the taillights. They look like a ghetto, smooshed Camaro's taillights. Very, very, very gross on a Corvette.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wMHEspuLho&t=218s&ab_channel=MatthewLowry
Doug, How about a review of the Lotus Esprit V8?  It's one of those classics from the same era as the Lancia Delta Integrale Evo II and the Nissan Skyline GTR R34.  Jeremy Clarkson said the Lotus Esprit V8 was a great car and very under-rated.  A review of this car would be great!
Can’t wait to have mine!
Is it true that GM already killed off the C8 Z06?
I’m so thankful Chevy made this. A fantastic mid engine sports car, arguably a super car, definitely has super car performance, and it’s within reach of the common man. This kind of sports car should not only be for multi-millionaires.
These new Corvettes are stunning, and very cool.  Corvette has really upped their game in recent years.
The only thing I hate about the C8 is it’s back. It’s so ugly, I prefer the great sleek looks of European sport cars. I wish they would round that back a bit, bring in those massive flares and make it look like a Ferrari. Man that would be gorgeous.
No manual 🤢
Thiiiis.... has to be the worst color for a car this awesome.  Although, the more I look at it the less I hate it.
I no longer have any desire for Ferrari/Lamborghini/GT40
Keeping my 911 until C8 Z06 comes out
Love watching your videos, I would like have more infotainment reviews of future cars.
Is the top level corvette the zo6 or it’s another level after that
This is a pre-production car but the tires are definitely not new but have clearly seen some use.
That thing is sick. I would love one someday
I'll take ugly crap no one wants to buy for 500, doug
Nice car and fair prise
Is this electric car?
Corvettes have looked like shit for the last 10 years!  I'll take the bus!
Looks like their new camaro from behind.
"Under the hood" just doesn't seem right with a mid engine lol
The dealership mark up prices on these cars are insane, like $20K-$30K from MSRP
But is the aero package included in the ZO7 package?
Chevy like "you can look at it but you're not driving it."
man is so important he gets to touch the car before most ppl see it
Holy white balance Batman
Why does he talk like that
Listen to this insane sounding zo6 https://youtu.be/cqhzns43a_g
So noooobody going to call out how the corvette is literally turning into a budget Ferrari? 😂 😂 😂 I understand the engine but the looks get closer and closer each time. Doesn't even look like a corvette anymore.
I love this car.  Its hands down my new dream car, that i will own some day.
Chrysler 301 Ford 302 G M 350
Damn Doug coming at us with a review from the void
Fun fact, Doug hesitates when at the choice of either two restrooms.
that car can easily beat Ferrari and Lambo possibly ford gt as well
Nice car… my goal !
The rev was nothing!!! Just above idle WOW
He keeps getting his C7 and C8 mixed up, lol 😆.
460 TORQUE???
I have beyond HAPPY with my 2019 Z06... With 650HP/650TORQUE and all the goodies!
This car is amazing. Can’t wait to see it destroy the competition.
I Love it 😁🔥
That's a DREAM CAR 😎🔥
We want to see the engine even in the convertible model, make it happen
Porsche does  Is interior personalization for all their models, it's kind of crappy that gm only does it for the Z06 model
Still a beautiful car but i still miss the circular tail lights!
Brian walker..  Paul walker - Brian
This car dude
The amount of bass from that exhaust while it idles at first sounds crazy even through head phones
this is cool, but i just miss the older corvettes they had their own personality. this doesn't feel like a corvette. kinda the same with camaro. like the car is cool, but they shoulda named it something else. cause the old camaros were awesome.
Doug reviews every car at this point
Price is MSRP X2
That is the best looking face I've seen on a car
Figures. Ugliest vet ever painted the color of puke
Man.. i`m still waiting for they to eliminate that horrendous side lines to exaggerate the side scoops vents, i think is that ditail is the only thing ugly in this car.
1 pedal short of perfection
I'm skeptical about the acceleration times , the 2.6 0-60 & 10.6 1/4 mile are too ambitious and probably achieved with a 1 ft rollout , I think a 0-60 in 2.9~3 seconds & 10.8~ 10.9 1/4 mile is more realistic , still very fast and exciting!
I always new Chevy had the potential 🤔 I just didn’t want to admit 😒 I don’t have much of a choice now do I 😒. Yeah I’m just joking 🤔 but there was a point in time when I didn’t like Chevy for jealous reasons, dumb ones at that. But a hey I’ve started like ing Chevy months ago.
too bad Doug! Jay Leno beat you to the punch with the drive... sorry to always Corvette fanatics out there but I think this looks like a batmobile. Garish & unattractive...
Ive never in my life seen someone move so much when they talk lol
looks like a generic GTA car that imitates a supercar
I love it. I think it's one of the nicest looking supercars around at a fraction of the price. I prefer it to the Aventador even. Well done Yanks. I would have one over here even with the left hand drive.
It looks so awesome. The price point is making it an unobtainable car anymore though.
him and Jay Leno could be relatives
Those old Pontiac style rims look awful.
225k is my guess.
I feel like the new corvette was more expressive at the lower end of the spectrum. The base model came out and blew everyone away; this is just an American made Ferrari to me.
Meeeh, I’ll wait for a ZR1 release
Does the Z07 include the aero package?
Ugly color
Doug's the type of guy that owns Dr Who's Tardis :))
Don't get me wrong, I love Corvettes. But...Pontiac had them beat to the whole mid-engine thing three decades plus ago. #resurrectpontiac #fiero #plasticfantastic
Not a fan of the interior at all
My Z06 is BEST Z06 because, Z07 aero package.
Nothing wrong with a wider rear end. That is what I always say.
convertible?
Great car ,wrong presentator.Jumping around the car like a warf in a muddy forest.
I’m wondering about that square steering wheel. When Casey Putch reviewed the regular C8 he said it was difficult to drive because you can’t easily put your hands at 9 and 3 which means you can’t turn the it as far. I haven’t heard anyone else mention that aspect.
Lol i like how this is what ive been seeing people say will walk a dodge demon, 840>650 all day
it looks cgi
Play around with the playback speed for a good time
Just incase anyone was wondering, the car in this video is VIN 001, and sold at Barrett Jackson for $3,700,000
Six... hundred... horsies... out of a NA v8!!!
Hopefully it's not marked up
it is absolute beauty
Sounds like my snowmobile at idle.
Nobody: Doug in every video: "THHHHHHIS..."
What a beauty!!!
Not my kind of sound. American V8s are known for their sound because they are... crossplane!
It looks like a bumble bee from another planet!
8600 rev limiter. That’s unbelievable man. Never would’ve imagined 🤷🏾‍♂️
Me no like
I'm getting the coupe you can still remove the roof anyways and see your engine its stupid to get the convertible
Didn't think they'd switch from the deep growl LS to a Ferrari-sounding flat plane V8.
About the same price as my truck... bet insurance is a tad bit more per month lol 😆
I guess 10 out of 10 on this
I never realized how much time you spend flailing. Your sales sideline ......... meh...  lovn you still Doug no problem
At this moment I really think that if I buy this car I'll definitely take the ZO7 package because then I'll have the Aero package FOR FREE
Cant wait to see how much the dealer markup on these will be.
Incredible test drive, that thing is so fast
Priced at 100k I’m in love with it but ima stay with my Camaro ss
What a horrible color why do people have yellow on their cars such a puss color I prefer red
This engine should be put a silverado metric power
Probably going to be 200k
This is literally the best entry for a high level sports car. Great pricing, mechanics, power, exterior design. Just beautiful.
2 yrs to create that unique engine sound? Talk about coming to work and doing nothing.
I’m currently saving for this, I can’t wait 😝
Wow, this is the FIRST interior that doesn't look like a Chevy.  ...That's a compliment. Still trying to understand the Star Trek square steering wheel.
While I still think the GT500 sounds better holy crap that's one hell of a exhaust note
Can't wait to see this race a GT500 it'll be close but definitely to the C8s favor now
I expected no less from one of the top 10 least reliable cars for 2022.
first thing , for sure this thing wont be able to do 0-60 in 2.5  im 100% sure it wont achive the number
Are Z07 logos included with the Z07 package?
wow, we need one of these in Tokyo...
the metal vents are soooo flimsy cheap. would be the 1st thing to replace.
looks like a  $500,000 lambo
Still looks like a fake Ferrari.
I get so bummed when you don't test drive a car.. I don't care about the quirks and features. I just wanna see the look on your face driving it around
Wait what year am in??
I’m still not a fan of the body style. The C7 looks awesome. The front end of the C8 looks ok’ish but the rear end with the tail lights is hideous asf.
Ewww.  It’s yellow.
Waste of time. Videos design to get hits to make money and are worthless unless your interested in entertainment only and you find this entertaining. I don't.
Can I get manual trans?🤔🧐
Doug is cool actually,he grows on you like scurvy.
Thissss, is an over enthusiastic American.Oh & a car.
Chevy should check their calendar... 2022 has just started.... 2023 is far away.
🅿️
Coming soon to a ditch near you !!!!!
Doug gets to drive Lamborghinis, Ferrari's, RR etc. But Chevy's like. Nah we don't trust you. 😂
It’s going to scream
Hennessy will give it his touch
The only ICE I would buy.  Saw a guy in a C8 just slicing through traffic.
Pure fugly. They lost their way after the C6, which was a design downgrade from the C5.
If I mute you, these videos aren’t too painful
But will it have a manual option?
Doug it's called a hatch. Not a tailgate trunk thing. HATCH
too bad that these things are going to be being price gouged to the point of McLaren or Lambo money
It’s a refined Fiero!
I’m glad I’m not a Plebeian! Hahaha nice review, Doug! Thanks
The whale tail spoiler spoils the entire look
It's still a pushrod pig engine though. . . Ford have destroyed them in that department . . .we'll and in every other department
Looks like a ferrari rip off
Great car but to bad the communist dealers will mark them up out of greed
Dork
Amazingly Beautiful car
Vertical doors would have killed it
I mean i get they won't let you drive it but damn... we can't even hear a damn rev? lame
great review doug, thank you!
Thisssssssss
Lamborvette
Any idea on pricing for the Z07?
So a Lamborghini inspired interior
that wing is fucken ugly!! they couldve done a better job on the overall look. I'm disappointed in the direction they are going in but i'm not buying one so don't listen to me lol
Flat plane was invented by Cadillac in 1923. I didn’t even know Cadillac was around in 1923.  It does sound really good. Lamborghini does also. Will be interesting to see how they compare.
Here's the problem with  it. The overwhelming majority of people who buy this car will never take it on a race track. If you want to buy a race car do not waste your time with a corvette. Buy a RACECAR!!!   A Corvette customer wants to drive it on all the normal car driving streets.
who would by this car for a track runner it sucks ??  vetts are terrible on tracks they always lose in every competition they ever enter vs any other cars on track competitions.  last time vette won a track competition was the 50s n 60s, all version after that nada.  that line control bar between driver and passenger is retarded, place it back on the dash buttons or something, driving its bad, because you have to look off the road to see which side button to hit unless you rember the entire colum of button orders for one you may need to use while driving.  really bad.  making driver look inside and down away from road just to turn A/C or something on is garbage.
This thing looks like a childs hot wheel playing car..
Awesome as always, but the color differences of the yellow in the different cameras being used is really messing with my eyes on this one. Bright yellow one second, muted and pale the next, then back to bright.
Just wait until you do a brake job on those carbon ceramic breaks....  On the Austin Martin it will cost you $30k... how much for a break job on the corvette?
We call the rear hatch a decklid not a tailgate.
I thought this was a Ferrari 😂😂
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
We get it. The aero package is included with the z07 package. Holy shit man you don’t have to say it fifty eight times
As Chevy fan, I liked the new Mach 1 a lot more
I'm most excited for Doug to get his hands on the E-Ray and Zora C8 variants.
First thing imma do is LS swap it.
I hate the new vette. 2019 zr1 is the best they ever did .
Wish it was a manual.
Get ready for massive dealer greedy markups, at some point just buy the Lambo or Porsche
Doug's the kind of guy to wait outside a production line to be the first to review a Corvette Z06.
Bro I remember subscribing to you when you had 200k subs! Now 4million!!! Let’s go!!!!!
Jezz he’s such a dork like saying gms description of the exhaust  And whenever he uses plebeian  Doug is so cringy sometimes
I like it. Looks more like a corvette than McLaren lmao
Corvette is the American equivalent to Lamborghini.
I’d rather get this over a Ford GT 💯
I like that lip in the front...the big complaint was understeer, and I bet that will help
@3:54 Doug's audio has an interesting quirk and fx feature for a split second
Doug, Defend your work. No Drive? No free advertisement.
jay leno did get to drive it, in his channel...
I just feel something wrong an American car with an “Italian” engine
Biased asf....
Make it electric
manual has my $$, otherwise just another appliance, bust/fail
I can’t wait to drive this car while bumping “ caged up “ #available on my page and all platform.
Is it the best corvette ever ? Probably.  Is it better than a 911 GTS ? Not bloody likely 😏😉
They owe one to every taxpayer.
Good video.  Glad our 11 billion dollar bailout went to a good cause.  Billion.  11 Billion.  I'd rather walk.
Worst color ever.
I call ba on the invisible air strips that help get better track time haha.
Must get
Must get
Ok, so what fancy, super, hyper cars do you own Mr.Demuro?
I wonder if it's going to have the superpowers the current corvettes have: garbage transmissions and endless breakdowns.
Big fan
The Tires alone for this Car are $3,500 a Set of 4…🤦🏻‍♂️🖕🏼🤷🏻‍♂️ and that’s on one of the Cheapest Online Sites..🤦🏻‍♂️
Imagine if this car had torque vectoring awd
The exhaust tip shape is to make it so the exhaust note is reflected into the interior.  The car was too quiet on the inside, so they redirect sound with exhaust tip shape.  High performance Corvettes have had factory 335 tires for 12 years.  It's a popular aftermarket upgrade to go even wider.  345 being "wide" for a Corvette is an odd talking point.
Stunning... We need an electric version. All wheel drive.
Chevy, it’s 2021 still.
In yellow and the angle in the thumbnail it looks great . I love the C8 for what it is but a car that in real life on the road the ones I have seen don't look as good as photographs that capture good angles . It's not bad just not as great as some pictures . I think It is some of the sharper boxy lines . It's like a combo of Lambo sharp lines mixed with more round type Ferrari ish lines ?
I detest the steering wheel and the fact it doesn't have a manuel available.
The nicest car interior EVER😍, for under $1M
It looks so different from traditional corvette design but it’s a very 🔥 look.
People who complained about this new Z06 not being advance enough in comparison with C8 Stingray,  are complaining just to complain. 1st world problem as to say!  For last couple of Corvette generations, all Z06 was...  A wider body, upgraded wheels, brakes and suspension, bigger more powerful engine and maybe few more interior upgrade options.  So someone who complains this was not done on C8 is not a car nor a Corvette enthusiast. Not only the the body was widened by 3.6", but the quarter panels were noticeably raised above the rear wheel area when the bigger more volumized inlet ducts were engineered. Several  options are available for wheels. Couple of  aero package options to choose from. Different availability of brake options. Unlimited interior trims and colors. And the main highlight of the Z06, is the ENGINE. Listen to that Z06 specific high rev redline engine!!! What more do you want for under 100K price tag??!!!
That. Is the car rod wave crash
I like the details of his videos but is his manner of talking the most annoying in the world? I cannot stand it
Corvettes look nice, but take the badge off and you wouldn't know it's a corvette. Thing I admire about mustangs it that they retain the mustang look
Key word iiiis... BIG      OH... & DEAL
LOL Flat plane crank = issues with harmonics. Will wait for this to turn out to be junk. Wonder how many liters of oil this thing will drink a mile.
Goddamn Doug Demuro is the worst
I can't wait for the 2024!
How much do you think this exactly build would cost? That thing is gorgeous. I’m thinking like 150k after all packages
you couldn't drive it because GM let Jay leno drive it first!
+1 on the convertible
price  ?
This car is ugly it looks like haloween pumpkin face in front tsk tsk.  I have no idea what they were thinking on the side vents. Back end is ok though
Well dodge viper acr extreme you may be replaced as my dream car
I might just have to get one of these anyone know where I can buy one ? 🤔
Doug the type of dude who gets the newest game system in the neighborhood. Invites you over then doesn't pass the controller.
The C7 Z06 and ZR1 both had larger from openings different front ends.
All that just to get smoked by a Tesla 😆
Plz do new cts-v
FYI you can adjust the rear camera angle from inside the car
You dont know shit about cars
Wow I love this new one but my favorite is definitely this one from Victor Racing i saw at the Sema Show, its fire!
Why no single lug wheels, though? C'mon...
WOW it looks amazing! I upgraded mine just a couple of days ago with Victor Racing parts, i think the wing would fit this one perfectly!
How the heck did Chevy made a car from 2023 when it's 2021
The 2023 Corvette is already here and we’re not even in 2022 yet. These people need to slow the fuck down.
corvette is starting to look like a migrant from europe. haha
I have to admit the car really does look Beautiful.
I'm hoping my crypto does good in 2025 because I'm getting one
If these were sold without markups, and weren’t so hard to get, I think I might have to go for it.
Only to get spanked on the straight by a Plaid
Lol i heard that slip up and voice edit at 11:23 Doug,  u ain’t slick 😂
Imagine a carbon fiber hood 😍😍😍
I have this car.. on Forza Horizon 5
Doug is changing the world. Thank you sir
That’s pretty.
Naturally aspirated. 😍 #680
High I’m Doug, let me show you some cool shit you can’t afford 😅
That’s a poor man’s Ferrari
Too bad gm doesn't honor the warranty.
Looks like a Mclaren
Terrible lighting.  Low CRI. Common man, learn your craft.
2023?
Looks like a lotus/ferrari copy
Doug, Love your review on the new Corvette. Thanks! the magnetic suspension developed by GM has been in use on Ferrari models in the recent 599 GTB...
so they are coming out with two new models? the z06 and the z07 and an optional package called the z07 package that is only available on the z06 model, but is included in the z07 model?   maybe they can rethink these names and come up with something even more confusing, but i doubt it.
If i had a car company I would make cars purely for joy of driving and quality instead of profits. I can only dream
in a land of turbos on everything I love the fact its NA, turbos are great but theyre being over used on everything
I will never forget the time he farted in a car review video and left it in the video 😂😂
C8 corvette potential buyers... better go get one NOW.... the corvette plant just got hit by a damn tornado and caught fire.... the price is about to go through the damn roof as supply is about to stop.
Someone explain how they're calling this a 2023 when we're not even in 2022 yet lol
Is that black smoke from the exhaust ? Or am I seeing it wrong ?
Doug loves it, impressed by it but still hates it just because it's a Chevy. You can tell by how he keeps saying "Chevy says" and other stuff.
Oh yea!  The 60k mid engine wonder. Dealer prep is 100k.
it looks like a rendering
Evolution of Chevrolet Corvette  https://youtu.be/UbqgFfpQAEU
Pictures don’t do this car justice
bald ass tires on that thing lol, someones been having fun.
They need to make that back panel from the door to the back needs to be round!
what will people do with their C8 when biden outlaws gas stations....
whats with GM dressing the car up to look like a giant lemon...
2023.... It's not even 22😂😂 car manufacturers are ruining their brand
Looks like a 2 door Camry with a weird spoiler
Does this guy talk like this in his daily life???????
Lovely interior customization… just makes me wonder WHY wouldn’t GM expand this customization to Cadillac??? The thing holding Cadillac back is the interiors… this could be a gamechangee for them.
Thissss is muppet Doug demuro
You can promote it but not drive it...please, no thanks.
You deliver the goods as usual. Keep em' coming.
Doug is so CONDESCENDING with how he speaks about corvettes and similar American cars.  If he doesn’t like the cars he shouldn’t feature them so he doesn’t have to sound annoyed at track packages for cars that won’t be tracked. He never sounds this condescending when he reviews porches or benzes that have superfluous go fast race bits.   But he sounds like he hates the car and the people who like it here.
I wonder if the z07 package includes the aero package, I wish Doug would elaborate a little bit more on that :(
Interior better
This car is greatness
100k
People want boost. Give them boost....
American Cars always seem to have orange peel paint at no extra cost
I personally think Old Corvettes with the Circle lights look way better than this Robotic design.
why not call it the 2027 corvette ... this is ridiculous it's 2021 now.. so it's a 2021 in my book
WORST PART of the Z06…..  **NOT** _roadhead-friendly_ **AT ALL**  👎
This Corvette is even more in the Super Car territory. Let’s wipe the smug smile off the European super car manufacturer’s faces
You can hear this beast and see it drive on Jay Leno's Youtube channel, it's music to the ears, like no other American muscle car
I think this corvette is one of the best looking, im just not a fan of the big square butt it has, these without a wing look ehh
what a monster
Obsessed with the 2023 Chevrolet Corvette C8 Z06 already! Total game changer. 🙌
So, does the aero package come with the Z07 package?  Not sure he said it enough times
Wow this car is amazing looking
Looks like a Celica went through 20 evolution changes and upgrades.
When I see this piece of shit from far away I'm always like.... oh shit a Ferrari but then when closer I'm like: oh just a corvette 😒
Went from Ferrari to Lamborghini 😂
Doors should go up on the new vette come on Chevy
I doubt the 0-60 is even close to 2.5 seconds . They claimed 3 flat for the c8 yet everyone that has reviewed one on YouTube could only get 3.5 with a good launch so this car probably does it in 2.8-3 seconds
I loved my Z06 until Heritage Chevrolet in Owings Mills Maryland destroyed it.  They replaced the transmission and managed to damage virtually every panel on the car, the leather, etc.  The car crab walked when I got it back!?!  I haven't had the car in 3 months.  At this point another GM dealership is trying to sort it out at my expense.  GM did nothing but direct me back to the dealership and the general manager there denied everything and tried to sell me a used car. I'm just disgusted at this point and this video doesn't improve my feelings about GM. I can't imagine handing over another $130,000 only for one of their dealerships to destroy the vehicle again and leave me with an expensive pile of junk. Best of luck to anyone who will find themselves in a similar position.
colour looks faded
How am I supposed to get serviced in this thing with the panel blocking interaction with the passenger? Sexy on the outside, poor design on the inside.
mannnn we're still in 2021...
From what you are saying this is technically a ZO7 Everything on the car still says ZO6 though, lazy(not you, Chevy)
This car is sick
We miss him come back soon videos
Great!  GM's Lambo
Meh
13:34 what we're all here for lol
Does the guy ever take a breath?
Jay got to drive it. Sorry Doug
Hope the world is still here in 2023 to actually drive one.
Not impressed with this model
i cant believe im gonna win the lottery next week and buy this. how dreams come true.
Too bad GM won't be around in 7 years or so. 🤷‍♂️💀
I was so surprised when he said it was a naturally aspirated motor. Imagine if they supercharged this new fancy crank motor....
Drive them while you can, because the New World Order plans to make it illegal for anyone to even register, much less drive a personal gas-powered vehicle on any public roadway, no later than the year 2030.
I dunno what it is but the corvette just seems like the most played out car ever made.
This is Future Doug
only tune in to see if Doug can fit comfortably inside. If he can’t fit, I can’t fit. If I can’t fit, then I won’t let myself want one 14:35
Man they took fords ideas wheels, engine
We are still in 2021 I'm sure the factory started to build this car in 2020
You know for a fact the mid age life crisis people going to buy the basic price C8 Z06 but the young guys will get the fully loaded package going around 130-150k easy
it sounds almost exactly like the ferrari gtc4 lusso
Poor man‘s R8
I thought this was going to be a Corvette review. Looks more like a Ferrari knock off review. The Corvette's front engine muscle car design was unique. This is  not.
this dude speaks with his whole body
Love this car!  Will own one someday.     He's so dramatic....
ngl this is one of the nicest looking cars I've ever seen
Poor GM, ol' Gub'ment Motors, that's not a Corvette, man, that's an entirely new platform that deserved an entirely new name. Super, mega and hyper lame. 👎👎👎
2023?
I always feel like ZR1s are always more powerful than Z06s
Fuck hou Jay Leno did it already
It looks like it would be difficult to receive head while driving
Doug is the type of guy that goes 2 years into the future to show us a car in the year of 2021!!
I can’t wait to see what the zr1 will look like
🤷‍♂️THIIISS, is the the new corvette.
That's funny, did anyone else catch Doug saying Z07?
deeeezzzz nuuuttsss
Doug loves the rear
2023? We’re not even in 2022 yet what the.. was I in a coma?..
Corvette stepping their game up
The c6 and c7 z06’s have wider tracks than the base models.
I cant wait to see the awful reliability of C8s knock the Doug score down once he can drive it.
lol “price boost” idk why that’s funny
wtf is zee? its zed o six
Looks fucking gross, zr1 was the best
Damn Chevy
I’m sure it will be better on the road but I’m just a bit underwhelmed by this Z06…maybe need to wait for a ZR1 version.
ZO7 on the ZO6 is confusing
so it transforms into a robot yellowjacket right
nice that they softened the lines a little bit...didn't really like the batmobile version
Carbon fiber everything will not age well. Just as tacky as dated screen function technology. It should be polished aluminum or piano black stuff. I myself like luscious red leather interiors.
The first aftermarket company that corrects these ugly rear lights to ROUND led lights will make MILLIONS. That original designer should be fired.
Well done america, the blue collar ferrari is now better than an actual ferrari.
Let's see how it does on the track against the Porsche. Races will be fun to watch
THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Comes with wife beater, gold chain and sack of weed
186mph governed. I guarantee it can do north of 210mph tweaking that computer.
Okay but, did he cold start rev it? Or does that black smoke just come with the car?
kind of annoying as he keep saying Z06, like two hundred times
I guess gm put so much work into the c8 they completely forgot about the rims. Looks like they pulled an old dusty set from the back of the warehouse. The rims for this gen are crap lol
This, or a tuned Lotus?
Well at least Henry Ruggs will not get in one of these for awhile. Because you know, he might kill someone else.
The best and the last car of the world
3.6 Inches is a "significant increase" he says. I've always been told it's below average and leads to unsatisfaction. Weird
To be honest this is nothing more then an obscenity in this dying age of over pollution. Zero thinking for future, just money grabbing... it's a shame, they could have asked Tesla for helping them build a truly performant electric car because as it stands it'll be nothing more than dust in the rear mirror of Tesla Roadster.
How many people are going to crush their fingers while trying to open the trunk lol
Doug: let’s take a listen to the exhaust Also Doug: proceeds to only rev to 3000 rpm when the red line is 8600rpm
Waiting for carbon wheels, painted in silver. Carbon structure tends to look outdated nowadays.
What’s the colour of this car?
THIS..........
Dam why the dislikes hating asses
Wait.....what? 2023?? 2022 hasn't even begun yet....🙄
Game changer.
Is it just me or are Ferrari and corvettes becoming more similar in their body styles. Look at the new models of each
They should have put the wing on the trunk so if you wanted to take it off it would be easier
You can't drive it, because GM i.e. it will fall apart the second you take a corner.
HVAC HAPPY TRAIL
Just put a 5k deposit to be added on the list #21
Plaque is off centered 😬
Spent “two” years making it sound like dogshit compared to the gt350 flat plane.
Did anyone realize that he said “under the hood” when he was talking about the engine?
Have to break this up into 3 minute segments.  The soy high pitched voice is tough.
I don't like it.. It's nothing wrong with it, it's just that corvette has always been it's own.. But now it's just another mid engine super car, they all look alike...
Front bumpers on Z06 gens C6 and up ARE different. Check your facts buddy.
aint gonna lie, thought he said 286 mph, like yeah that IS pretty impressive for a car under twenty jabiltion dollars.
GM estragou o desenho no C8 .Parte detrás e horrorosa , rear wing horroroso, a GM deveria rever isso para C9
htf did u get that???????/
I'm definitely getting one of these the day it comes out.       On Forza.
This corvette is jaw-dropping.
Still the ugly car
I love the roof flashing in the front end. What a piece of crap!
That is one ugly car from every angle. Obviously designed by Americans for Americans
Everyone always gets so excited when the Z06 comes out on every generation.  Little do they know the ZR1 is right around the corner
Does the Z-07 package include the Aero package?
Who can afford a car like this in the Joe Biden economy?
Looks good
I look at the c6 zo6 and c6.... not much different either like...... I'm happy this looks much different even without the zo7 package
Not gonna buy it, saving for the c8 zora
lmao i want dodge to bring back the viper to battle the corvette now it has to happen its inevitable
Take notes ford.
Body and interior is nice but I'm just not impressed with this or any fossil fuel engine. Electric is the practical direction to go.
18:25 if this rabid Mustang fanboy can immediately tell that isn't a normal C8 Corvette at a glance, what's everyone else's excuse?
Why did you mute the color in a lot of the shots?! The yellow looks like Chevy was trying to be gender neutral baby yellow! Gross. Doug, you need to fix the edited color temp, because it makes even the black look bad.   Really glad the yellow isn’t that ugly! But your video needs fixed!
Loving this vehicle!
Too bad this won't be as good a deal after dealerships slap 40k on top of GM's price point.
so sikk
GM has taken the lead. Then dodge then Ford.
Dam nerd.  Love him. 🇺🇸
Not even 2022 and we have 2023 cars… but I like the attention to detail the person who put the car in place did to make the wheel badges upright across all wheels.
It’s not even 2022 yet.
No driving :( That’s the only part I watch lol
Weak ass exhaust example. Rev that thing out!
So is it light yellow or bright yellow? 🤔 color changed with every shot
for some reason the corvette and super bee are the only 2 cars black and yellow works, for me
I watched Jay Leno's review yesterday.
You are really good.. But for this video... I would request you to listen to your speech content.... Too much z06... Z07... Aero.... Etc... Etc.... You usually have good quality speech content... Not this time... Just my opinion... Always wait for your post... 👍
Thank you Doug. I cannot wait till you are able to drive it. I currently own a C7 Z06 and would like your feedback on the new one. My biggest concern is that the C7 Z06 has 150 more ponds of torque. I appreciate all of your honesty on these vehicles sir!
He always looks like he needs to pee. Good video though.
Flat Plane Crank, Guys @ SVT jump ship?
They let Jay Leno drive it. Why not let Doug?
Goofball
so it's the c8 z06 with a z07 package? why America. why.
Daddy Jay drove it
And it’ll go for $100k over msrp 🤣
The fact that jay leno drove this exact pre production model and they didn’t let Doug drive it 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
Lmao Doug can't drive it but Jay Leno had one and was out hot rodding the piss out of it
The seatbelt latch is loud and red.  Thank you Doug.  It looks like it came out of my 1999 Suburban.
Glad I  cancelled my C8 preorder to wait for this!
Mysterious fact : when Doug advertises his auction website , he stands on back of the car he hasn't reviewed , and after some time the same car review video comes on which he stood behind during the advertising time . How is it possible?
Geez.  Another YouTube channel promoting cars for car makers.  Just to get followers and make YouTube cash.  Everybody is now a star on Youtube.  Hilarious!
I wamt the manual version of it!
Congrats, Doug, on GM finally allowing you to review the Corvette early in the line up and launching your review on the reveal launch date.
GM is making the social media circle's, Doug, Jay Leno, Emily, all with their new Corvette. They let Jay Leno drive it, it looks to be the same one. Sharp car, but at $100,000, out of my reach.
6 minutes in and you haven't mentioned the flat plane crank engine yet.. 🙄  He finally got there
whoa, carbon fiber wheels is a pretty big deal. last i heard only Koenigsegg was doing that. Though, I just looked it up and it looks like theres a few brands that offer it, including Ferrari and McLaren (no surprise) but also the Mustang GT350R
You need a different mic setup for exhaust clips. All I could hear was distortion.
I wonder if this is the exact car Jay Leno drove recently.
no drive?
Sad that May, Hammond, and Clarkson never got their Top Gear hands on this one. I think some opinions of American muscle cars might be shattered. Took Chevy long enough, but they got there. Thanks, Doug.
I refuse to watch this fake Add. Go to hell.
I’m gifting myself this car when I get my Pilot’s License 🙏
It just occurred to me... I wonder if the next ZR1 will be an electric all-wheel-drive vehicle? Can you imagine putting a Tesla S Plaid drivetrain in a Z06 body? Yikes!
didnt even drive wow
A few hours ago?  You the Man Bro!!!  Outstanding!!!  ....  I think you touched it before Leno  Amazing!!!
Can't wait for dealers to sell them for $230,000 when they finally come out. The regular Z51 C8s were already marked up to $170k or so, so the Z06 is going to be absurdly overpriced to start. People are STILL paying $20k over sticker for regular C8s.  And just wait for the ZR1. $300k easy. And if the Zora rumor is true.......think of a number, now think of a bigger number.
Jay was driving it with one of the engineers....
The wheels are carbon fiber too!?! No wayyyy!!!! 🤩
Lately, you are just talking! It feels like reading a blog post and showing photos of a car.
Okay cool... it's naturally aspirated from the factory... but I'm sure I'm not the only one who wants to see it with a pair of spinny bois (and all the necessary confectionary) strapped to it.
Doug the type of YouTuber to get a "tour" video when others are doing drive reviews.
I'm trying my hardest to set myself up for life by keeping my shitbox and dumping everything towards paying off a house before a nice car but it's so hard😭
Who said the max speed is 186 MPH? The normal C8 max speed is 195 MPH
But what does the horn sound like???
Get some gloves you always touching every car nasty...you nasty
Surely it will do more than 186.
When will someone be able to review this thing and DRIVE it??!! Can’t wait for that.
l like the regular Z06 this one is for rich douche bags ,tho l like this better than any other exotic options  out there !!
Doug finally getting proper respect from Chevrolet.
Ichabod Crane read reviews on YT and now regurgitating it back,,, priceless 🤦🏽‍♂️💩
Wtf is wrong with this guy? What a clown
Looks like cheap Aventador copy. At least with better engine...
Wrong Doug... the C6 ZO6 had a bespoke front facia.  It wasn't a huge styling departure from the regular car, but it was unique.
Well, hats off to the new-gen ZO6 and to think there are even more powerful models coming, Corvette proves that switching to a mid-engine for the 8th gen Corvette was the correct thing to do, need proof, just look a the performance of the base pushrod (aka OHV) naturally aspirated V8, quicker than both C7 high-performance models (the ZO6 and ZR1), yes, not top speed, but honestly, you need power for top speed, Corvette show the world what a mid-engine Corvette could do with just a pushrod naturally aspirated V8, now, it going to show what it can do with a DOHC naturally aspirated V8 (for now), the funny thing is, this isn't GM's 1st DOHC V8, people seem to forget how far ahead the Cadillac NorthStar was vs the competition, pricing wise, anything less than a 100k is crazy, but it Corvette / GM and they always underprice their vehicles
You can tell he's impressed by how "huuuugeee" that wing is
This car is so cool but I would rather get it manual if they offer it automatic is kind of boring
"this huge carbon fiber wing is absolutely huge"  Its crazy to think that Doug has done absolutely zero to increase production value in years. 🤦‍♂️
So Doug is doing commercials now?
I'm a Ford guy but Chevy is killing it with these new vettes.
it's not even year 2022 and the car model is 2023? what is going on
2023? It's still 2021
🤤🤤🤤🤤
Throw in a hybrid z06 plus. Instant tourqe, at that hp you have a hyper car.
Cool car but it will be very limited production and will be next to impossible to get.  My local Chevy dealership already has close to 100 orders and they will probably only get one or two cars.
Not a fan of the rear end. I know that Chevy need to embrace brand identification but... let go of it. Much of the rest looks decent. I personally also am not real keen on the STEALTH BOMBER look of the shut lines. Just me thinking so it doesn’t truly matter.
This car looks ridiculous, get rid of that stupid fin on the back and bring back the classic rounded taillights, is this a friggin Camaro?? Get rid of the pointed nose finally and Doug, fix your mic, …ouch my ears🎤
Every time they bring out a new one it’s looks like a like a imitation Ferrari.
This is a Lamborrari, not a Corvette.
He drag it out to much
How can a rear wheel drive car hit 60mph in 2.5 seconds?   Wheel spin?
What would I pick this over a Porsche or a Ferrari? … Lamborghini design wannabe ! I feel embarrassed driving this car
It's giving me 458 vibes😃😃
I heard Doug is a shoe in to host Jay Leno’s Garage.
Девушку за коленку не потрогаешь
If Mountain Dew was a car.
The last Z06 with NA V8. A great finale!
This guy should be making videos on shoes not cars!
5.5 litter v8 then it’s not a corvette
This car is so incredible beautiful. Absolut respect to the creator.
ZZ632/1000 V8 is rated at 1004 horsepower.
What the hell is up with 2 ads every 3 minutes? I legit can't even watch the video.
I just can't get into the back of this car. To me it doesn't look good. Everything else is beautiful though.
Is it true they will not be taking orders for C8 Z06 until 2023?
What is the point of doing video about the car, that you can't drive?  :/
I'm loving hearing Americans talk about flat-plane cranks like they're a new development.
Damn. Design an exhaust sound for 2 years but can't break 200 mph? Who da fuck is the pussy at GM who did this ?!?
Flat plane V8.. impressive. Sounds fantastic! Very unique and exclusive.. nothing else sounds like that!
2.5 seconds.. bullshit. On the street, any AWD car with half the horsepower will beat it.
The Z07 and aero package are intended to improve …. profits.
And in 3 years, the headliner will start to fall and it will rattle like a bucket of bolts. It's still a "fine" GM product.
Looks like an awesome upgrade to an already great car (still wouldn't call it a "Corvette" for obvious reasons). No DOUBT this puts any Italian supercar manufacturer on notice! But I barely made it 2 minutes into this video. This guy's bobble head, bobble body and over zealous everything, just, it's just annoying. Sorry guy, great car and I'm sure it's great info on the car. No offense, I just can't watch this clown show without wanting to punch myself in the face.
I really don't like the designing of this car
I now feel somewhat inadequate in my 2020 Z51. The Z06 is a beast. Wish now I had gotten on a list years ago.
I think the lines are all wrong on this car.
literally a hot wheels car
Under the hood??  Engine is behind the driver bro!
So... it will only idle?
Left wanting the preliminary Doug Score🙂
The exterior is simply beautiful but the interior is just awful.  The dash and center console area are terrible looking
It's a beautiful race car. I own a 2010 ZR1 that I purchased new. I REALLY want a new Corvette but I am distraught over the lack of a manual transmission model. I'm 55. I've been driving Corvettes since 1999 and was a Mustang owner before that (when I couldn't yet afford Corvettes, they were my best bang for the buck.) I've only ever owned one automatic trans car in my life and that was in high school when my 1967 Cougar blew up the four speed and I ended up with a 4,000 stall speed 10 inch converter, full manual valve body C4.  So... kind of manual too.  Anyway, my long-winded point, is that I LOVE rowing through gears. I haven't adapted to or liked paddle shifters. I know, they are the latest, greatest.  But for many people, driving and cruising a mountain road is best when you are shifting the transmission with a manual gearbox.  I sure wish Chevy, whilst finding ways to add 6 interior colors and tons of plastic monikers, could have managed a 6 or 7 speed manual transmission...  I may bite the bullet and get a Z06. It would be my last hurrah. I really never expected to own a ZR1 and I happened to be at a spot in my career where I was able to do it, but I have 40,000 miles on that car now and drive it daily (I work close to home) and I just haven't felt like I'm driving a terrible car right now. I can't quite justify the damage that would do to my retirement fund vs just fixing from time to time and driving the ZR1.    If Covid hadn't screwed prices up, I'd probably search up a reasonably priced 2019 ZR1 and call it my last car of this type.  Boy I wish they would put a manual tranny in these. Maybe no one can drive a stick anymore?
Love the Car...hate the black wheels!!!
Gurney flap
Can't drive it, so will be a short video cool. oh... Nvm...
Z07 just looks like a time attack beast
terrible orange peal for such a "high performance" and sure to be "expensive" sports car.
Beautiful car. But damn why does every American car company struggle so hard on rim designs.
4 cams from a Chevrolet V8. Changing times. Probably doesn't make the mulletheads very happy
Love the video and can't wait for the Z06. Quick correction that the alcantara and yellow stitching is the same as the normal C8. Other than the carbon fiber bits inside, this is basically my car's spec. Not to knock the Z06, it's more highlighting how good Chevy is getting with their cars; even non-Z06 gets all of this customization.
Cars and bids, cool!!!!!
Henry ruggs should have waited
I put forth the question. Would it be acceptable for GM or aftermarket to put on Lambo inspired doors on this car? I don't think it would be out of place.
My allocation will be here next week, and I plan on driving it 3-6 months due to personal reason. Is there any configuration recommended, to reduce exposure, for resale since I’ll be selling within 6 months after driving it? I can only afford the 1LT so that’s a must. Color choices (exterior and interior), options, etc?
I love naturally respirated engines! Best sound
When can i buy one?
Z07 package, aero package package package. (in the future) Omg! You didn't get any packages?! No warranty for you
Damn, what an absolute stunner!
Passenger is going to be bored to death just like the C7.  The interior its too focused on the driver.  Nice Euro Corvette....I guess.  C6 is the last true corvette.
Doug could take my ex wife for a test drive and he'd probably sell me on her all over again... wonder what her Doug Score would be? 🤔
These mid engine Corvettes are hideous. They aren't really 'muscle cars' without that front mounted engine and huge long bonnet.
3:49 z07?????????????????
Love this car, but after seeing porsche squeeze 520hp put of a 4.0 naturally aspirated flat 6 in the GT3 RS I cant halp but think how crazy this car would be because it would have 715hp if it had the same hp per liter as the GT3 RS. Still 670 out of a naturally aspirated 5.5 v8 is still nothing short of phenomenal. This makes 121.8hp per liter which beats the 120hp per cubic inch Honda made in the S2000, which stood for quite a long time as the most hp per cubic inch of any naturally aspirated engine. Now engines like the 4.0 flat 6 in the Porsche GT3 RS make 130hp per liter which is freaking bonkers! What a great time to be around and even greater to experience these amazing cars!
The only thing missing is the custom color option.
Please review  any mercedes EQ
A mistake not to let Doug here take this fine machine on the road.  Love the car Chevy, but shame on you :)
Damn this ZO6 Corvette is bad arsh! It makes the Acura NSX Type S looks like an outdated car, love the Corvette interior, it out beats the Acura NSX Type S old outdated civic interior
Absolutely can’t wait for the C8 ZR1
apparently the new corvette is great in 127 MPH crashes while driving drunk
is it the lighting or is it actually pale fucking yellow? **edit** apparently it was just the thumbnail and the lighting its not pale ass yellow LOL wtf doug
This is the more Lambo than any other Lambos
Sorry but...todays sportscars all look the same.
?
the Z06 is the reason i disliked the initial c8. you can see that the widebody always was the initial goal and the first release was kind of adjusted to it. finally body lines make sense.  once you see that the stingray is off in it looks
thiiiiiisssssssss IS BABA YAGA
C6 ZO6 had a different front end than the base
"I can't drive it"   Then why didn't you wait to make this video until you could man 😭
Is it me or does that secondary door pull that opens the door mechanically look like extremely cheap plastic. Along with the plastic surrounding it.
Excuse me Doug, is it under the hood?
WHY DIDNT HE DRIVEEEEEEE IT!!!!
My 72 year old neighbor just bought one, nice car but I'd really prefer if it was available with a manual transmission
That's a Lambo with an identity crisis.
Dear  followers!! Don't let the beautiful pictures confuse you . Anyone who  buys a new car from GENERAL Motors the chance you threw your money into  the trash is very large. In this company there is no customer service,  the company's management does not care at all, if you have a problem or a  malfunction, you can only pray to God there is a chance that the help  will come faster. GM is a very dangerous company, be careful and keep  your money safe.!!!Share so more people don't get screwed.GM is a big bluf
God it's ugly. Mansory tacky right from the factory.
I rather but a 2020 NSX that is tuned to 700HP. It's an older design. But already has aged better than this C8. 😎
Thanks Doug, but when the picture of the convertible popped up, that really caught my eye. Based on your presentation, I would take the Z08, as a regular driving car, the Z06 is a race care disguised as a street car and sinse I don't race, I wouldn't spend the additional money, also, love the overall exterior design, its a game-changer for 'Vettes, however, I've never liked the gear-changers, nor the placement of the control buttons. Continues success & GOD BLESS U!
So the z06, the ultimate track focused vette, is more like a z04 1/2, where the actual ultimate track focused, the z07, is the real z06. Chevy is high on their own poo.
The car looks like the Yellowjacket suit from Ant-Man.
I don’t see how you can get laid in this car…and after all, isn’t that why you’d buy one of these?
I'd really like to hear that engine at 8,600 RPM.
I like these videos.  But, this guy move around like he's spastic.  It's odd and disturbing.
Does nobody care that the "Chevy Corvette" now looks like an Italian sports car rather than the American Muscle car that the Corvette used to be?  I always like the lines of the previous models.
VETTE DREAMS____I'm in Love Doug! For the MONEY 💰 IT'S HARD TO BEAT!!!
Most powerful naturally aspirated V8 in a Roadcar ever ? Well thats simply not true ...
Doug, those floating exhaust tips are specific to this ZO6/7 to enhance the 'sound' of that flat plane crank BEAUTY ____sounds and reverb returning to the driver/shotgun position! They have a specific 'fluted' shaping that reverses sound to the driver's cockpit! VERRRRRRRY CLEVERRRRRR
I love guys like Doug that truly love cars passionately.
Cant wait to see what the zr1 will have.
So we just skipping 2022 now
This is actually the coolest car honestly
Very lambo-esque
I see a single gigantic turbo installed in the rear storage space with a hole in the rear glass for an intake
If he lost his arms, I believe he would be mute.
Things about as ergonomic as the bottom of the ocean
Henry ruggs has proved it goes at least 156mph on the streets
If I didn't have to listen to that screeching voice though...
The back looks slot like a Camaro,,, don't look much like a Vette,,,,I think people are buying because they can and because it's new
Only a matter of time before they make an electric version...
Chevy is stepping up their game but still chasing the Europeans Ferrari and Mercedes always lead!!
Love it so beautiful yellow👍
Every Z06 (C5, C6, C7) had changes to the front end
They STILL haven#t protected those radiators from stones
This won't go for less than 200k.
No one caught that the plack had loose screws lol build quality of chevy
Flat crank flat crank
why are you this way
That yellow is brutal though.
I'm still confused. Does the Z07 package include the Aero package?
Can't wait to see a thorough tour of the 2030 C9 Z06 next year!
My Challenger 392 HEMI sounds better.
Based on the C8.R
Doug did they change the name from ZO6 to ZO7 I'm not trying to be funny because you kept saying that in the video.
Why would anyone want a Ford GT when this exists? Lmfao I want it so much.
First video I watched from this channel, but this guy talking feels weird.
Thank you Doug as usual your evaluations are very helpful. Chevy has spent A lot of hours and definitely done their homework on the C8 as well as the Z06. Thank you
There’s buttons on the mirror Doug that allows u to raise the camera up an down an zoom in an zoom out an change the brightness so u don’t see the wing when u turn the camera on
Kinda looks like a Ford gt from the side
Amazing. Why would they mount the wing right there?? Good luck loading the trunk...and be careful about smashing your fingers between the trunk and wing. And that camera!? Why!?
I love how they let him rev it to 3k rpm lol
I saw a reviewer complain that it didn't have an option for a manual but i dont see how that will be possible. Especially with that center console
Doug: not sure if this is a Ferrari or Corvette
Sounds like a mustang
Those wheels are fire 🔥
Beautiful beast. That color looks better with added decals (C8.R at the Rolex 24).
ZR1 i think was rumored to be a TT 5.5 liter and if the base 5.5 liter is 670 def gonna be a lot left on table power wise with TT setup. Even a mild 8lbs of boost could get 900 outta of it
@11:30 turbo is gonna be the zr1.
I mean how hard would it be to put Z07 badges on a Z07 option car.
What kind of corvette restricts the driver to touch the hot chicks legs occupying the passenger seat? Corvette used to be about being the cool guy with the hot chick, but now its all about racing, which nobody does anyway, they all just drive on the roads.
I want the old Corvette back
The GTR ruled the 2010s. The C8 will rule the 2020s
Kind of expected it to be lower, z06 badge on front fender, etc.. easier to spot a z06 is the c6 and c7 models. Also only 20 more horsepower then the c7.  C6 And c7 was a whopping 145 hp difference. Sorry corvette but I had better expectations. Hopefully zr1 won’t let us down.
What I heard was THIS, is an automa-*closes video
Dude.... The C6 Z06 front end was different than the base C6. The C7 Z06 front end was different than the Stingray. You don't know what you are talking about.
This corvette is bad ass
Thanks Doug! A great first look!
🇺🇲💪❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
No drive = not a review
Doug is in high blood pressure mode for this one. I was waiting for his lips to pop...
Amelia Hartford’s video they redline rev the motor so y can really hear it and it sounds Hypercar
This car is a big FU to all other car manufacturers...
How do larger openings at the front of the Corvette cool the engine now that it sits behind the passenger compartment?
Did he just review the new Corvette Z06 in a Ford GT T-shirt?
Doug the type of guy to do a unboxing of a box, just playing that car is cool looking. Wonder what the 0-60 time will be after some real world test.
you didnt drive it....FAIL
This is the ultimate performance American car.
Why even film this when you can't even drive it? That's stupid
I fricken hate doug, but I love this car.  It's the sickest corvette YET.
front side spoilers and rear spolier gotta go...otherwise it looks good.
I just know Tadge was aiming for the highest Doug score in its class.
but does it SHAKE?
Timestamp for the “Quirks and Features”??
I absolutely hate the rectangular back of the C8. C7 was sexier.
Wow
the performance and note is impressive as expected but at the end of the day it's still a Chevy and still aesthetically repulsive in just about every way possible. the Corvette will always be a retired boomer/midlife crisis grocery getter no matter how "cool" Chevy desperately tries to make it.
I thought it was a Lambo at first sight.
They shoulda waited for him to review it the day before release so he could drive it
7:59 Doug’s voice cracks.
Sorry, all I see is Lambo kit car.....
I believe the Z06's base MSRP is a complete fabrication. This car will average around $115,000 out the door. I don't even believe they will produce many base models.
I believe that the design difference between the factory Z06 spoiler and the upgraded package is so great that it was done intentionally in order to skew the perception of the vehicle's price.
Yum, yum. Love it!
The rear spoiler design is gorgeous. Absolutely perfect in both functionality and aesthetics.
That pale yellow is gorgeous on the chassis.
It's absolutely perfect.
this is just one giant ad.... i'll still buy it if's actually available without stupid markups
This what the NSX should’ve been.
The Corvette has a much *fatter ass* than other Corvettes.
Doug, you said there has never been a change to the front of the Corvette among the variants before the C8 gen, but that's not true.  On the C6 gen, the Z06/ZR1/Grand Sport all had an additional air scoop on the front bumper that the stock Corvette did not have.  The C6 Z07/ZR1/Carbon also had an additional front splitter/spoiler. The C7 generation also had some differences to the front depending on the variant, which is most pronounced on the C7 ZR1 with its specially designed front end for aero.
That is one long line of buttons.
Damn imagine the c8 ZR1.
I wonder when Chevy is going to incorporate active aero on the Corvette
Henry Ruggs III wishin’ he can get one of these… 10 years bro, 10 years.
Where’s the exhaust note?
Say "wider" one more time.
The carbon wheels have a cool purpose but are really ugly
I want to like this car. The engine appears to be amazing. But not being able to select options a la carte is a gap for those of us that do not want the Z07 package. I just cannot get by the rear wing and aero package. I would have liked the base Z06 with carbon ceramics and carbon wheels. They need to offer a bit more customization to those of us that cannot get by the pepboys style of Z07. Unfortunately a pass for me. But they will sell all they build.
It's still amazing to me that they managed to make the corvette not look like hot garbage rolled up to a midlife crisis. They almost should have given this car it's own name
TBH I see no reason to buy the Z06 apart from bragging rights. There is no way to get the base C8 to its max potential without going to a track, and you have to be a trained pro to do so. I'm not a pro and I don't have easy access to a track. I most certainly can't feel the difference between a 3 second and a 2.5 0-60 time. Not that I even know what a 3 second 0-60 time feels like... or have the money for either.
A track oriented car on runflats??
What’s up with all the dislikes on this one? Feels a bit like a chevy ad maybe
“The huge wing is absolutely huge” - Doug 2021😊
Guys he isnt going to drive it in the entire video.
This car is end game
Ugly colored fake Ferrari.
You know you're a baller when your C8 video gets more views than Chevrolets.
Why does the car keep changing colors in between the shots?
All the same, I kanesh, I understand that the rear-engine layout is cool and they, Chevrolet, have been trying to implement it all this time, but !!!! For me, the Corvette remained front-engined, with a long hood! And this one is ugly. .you don't have to chase ferraris and the like, very good, great companies. The corvette was original, with its own charisma, well, like the Spirit of Freedom, America and blah blah blah! What for? You went there, fuck that flap! Look at C2, C3 - they!!!!???????
Doug the 'car rapper' ; moves his hands more than  'Method Man'!
Doug kinda skipped the sound if the Vette real quick; it's not impressive,just awite compared to the LFA it sucks!
Pikachu
I'm guessing Doug has ran out of cars to review.  Hey, Doug, the new Toyota BZ4X is out for press release!!!   LOL
0-100 mph needs to be the new standard with cars like this.
can somebody tell why are american cars often (always?) photographed with color matching painted licence plates like this Corvette on promo pics & videos? are they obliged to have something on, but not forbidden to have it painted to blend in with the car's shapes?
GM always trying to copy Ford. Started from day 1.
Man….
I like wider rear ends and I cannot lie
Tell you though if you have that much power you need to go to the racetrack ask the guy who played for the raiders now his whole career is over he had to use that emergency door opener I'm sure very last car he will drive and he probably would never step foot in one again 🛣️😔
That car makes every European hypercar look like trash
When did Corvettes become Lamborghinis?
If this claps the Ford GT, Ford should be ashamed.
Why hate rear wings?
Doug is the marques brownlee of car world
It’s impressive but goddamn is it ugly
So the ZO7 package includes the aero package?
Thisss is a 1988 Doug Demuro.
I’m surprised they’re still making gas v8s
GARBAGE   pure      GARBAGE
THIIISSSS IS STILL A POS CHEVY AND YALL KNOW IT!!! 🤣🤣🤣👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
The C7 had a different front end and a wider track in the rear end. This is not the first time.
I live in bowling green where these are made, and it’s so fun seeing these bad boys down the road everywhere. I drive a mustang, so it’s unfortunate that I have such stark competition everywhere. makes me jealous 😭😭
This is like Porsche coming out with a front engine 911.  It wouldn't be a 911, just like this is NOT a Corvette.
This car is gorgeous. Love the color!
Needs clear tail lights like the c7z
Doug Doug Doug. C6,C7 both had different front ends over base models. Get your facts right man. Damn. 🤦🏼‍♂️
Wait so the Z06 model DOES include the aero package?
The C8 will be the best Corvette of the next 50 years
This car has a 90s badass aesthetic to it somehow. Cool as fuck exterior design.
What the hell is wrong with this guy
Next year is 2022 right?
Potato camera colors lol
these corvettes look so corny man lol
Can you please make a video with an “AAAAND!” counter in the corner?
not a fan of these vehicles, but it's impressive. chevrolet's finally done something right.
So if the hp is 670 and the price is 100k+ and it's so amazing what's the difference between the zl1 which is 650hp and 650tq and the zl1 is around 60 70k
Question is the corvette c8 z06 going to be in the dealerships?...🤔🤔🤔
The Z07 version does really look very cool. Great addition to the motoring world ! Did have a chuckle at his attention to the stitching course I have coloured stitching on a fairly basic Merc ... perhaps it was included in the AMG look option (0 carbon for me though) :/
Made in Bowling Green Kentucky! The holy site where our Lorne and Savior Lorne Armstrong transcended from rising country star to the immortal realm of The Cawdfather when he was united for the first time with the Blessed Virgin Kayla Marie.  Blessed be the holy land Bowling Green Kentucky.  Blessed be the Corvette ZO7   Awmen.   I want a white one, with gray on the bottom.
Doug, I was think the same thing. They dumb down the Z06 for the Z07 package.
Im so glad this car is coming out. The C8 ZR1 is going to be insane!!
I can't wait til next year for the 2062 Corvette C69 Z20
That wing is hideous! 😂
How did you mess up the engine soundbite?  That was the most important part!
Looks like a good girls car....and the now 4yr old Viper still beats it.
It's not even 2022 yet and they already sell 2023 models.
It's funny that they say the top speed is 186 they said the same thing when the C5 ZO6 came out so how is it the same twenty years later if that's the case then that is whack
I love how they somehow made it look like a hypercar while still obviously being a corvette
Chevy and GM have been taking nothing but Ws lately
C6 Z06 had a different front end when compared to the base
Sorry but the price will be well over 120k I’m sorry. Try around 150k with dealer mark ups. Nothing is msrp anymore unless you are lucky enough to be on the top 10 of a dealers list. Because most dealers won’t even see one. Only top vette dealers will, and all the old millionaires already got the allocation. So you probably won’t see this car.
It sounds so good like a LAMBO or a Ferrari 😬😳😏
This rear end looks way much better than the early model C8. I can take it.
Can I get the rear wing and the huge front splitter without getting the Z07 package?
What is up with this guy’s hands? Most annoying car video in a long time.
The car looks very weird and very unorganised the back wing is a joke the car looks like a Camaro on steroids
The exhaust note is something they're proud of because they engineered the exhaust to redirect the beautiful noise back into the cabin so the driver gets more of a connection without using fake noises like many competitors do.
lolz doug i feel like you smoked some crack before this one. awesome car tho glad the vett is being reworked as a proper race car.
If you want a better sounding exhaust get a 427.  I prefer side pipes. Boom!
Talking about disastrous interior,  they could not screw that anymore.
It doesn’t sound that well 🥴
The color is throwing me off lol it looks pastel in the video and super vibrant in the photos
Aerodynamic options in the front make the car look like a Lamborghini Urus
I'm probably gonna wait until 2030 when the price for this drops a fortune then I can afford one lol
"this huge carbon fibre wing is absolutely huge" - Doug 2k21
I already ordered mine.........         I can't wait to put it on top of my dresser! 😄
I like this new American Ferrari
Amazing car! Even if it were 50K more it would still sell out.
doug: “you can get the aero package or the Z07 package which includes the aero package” (2 mins later) “you can get the aero package or the Z07 package which includes the aero package” (30 secs later) “you can get the aero package or the Z07 package which includes the aero package”
Doug didn't consider the Corvette C7 Z06 a supercar so how about this car. His criteria though was silly. Since it had a cupholder it was disqualified!
Idc if it’s made of gold, Chevy lost me with the real people not actors ads
THISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Seeing the Vette next to Doug makes me realize how big the car is...
From the side it reminds me of Lambo Miura 2 concept
Trash midlife crisis cart
Tesla faster
Why tf can't you American's just say it's a 2022 car? It's not coming out in 2023.......like the 2024 is coming out in 2023 right? Can someone genuinely explain this to me please. Built in 2021, sold in 2022, called a 2023.
Looks like a wasp.
Paid content.   Disappointing.
Not that it matters that much but he says 0-60 around 2.5sec. The base 2020 c8 was tested at 2.5 yet he says 3. So what is it?
Learned a new word today "canards"...thanks Doug.🤣👍
Corvette getting uglier by the year, well done 👍
I like the fact he doesn't realize hes saying Z07 for the first half of the video.😂
I clicked on this video so fast
If you are obesse and want to lose weight...just move like Doug while talking...for every 5 words he says is like 25min of Zumba.
I would like to go lunch with Doug just to hear him order his food😁
To bad is not a manual
I guess we have to wait to see the acceleration face and the Doug score.
Will the car be available in right hand drive for Australia ?
a 100k car faster then a chiron 😩
It seems like you are showing 2 different cars because of the colors of yellow
Yes I love when my engine is humanized.
When I left my wife and she saw me with my new girl I was like ." THiss is my new girlfriend and ima tell you all her quirks and feature!"😂😂
Open the aperture 👽
The car is fantastic but the fact that GM is hyping the hell out of this car knowing full well that other than "preferred customers" most people who order right now (Iam on a wait list) won't see it until 2024 or 2025. That is outrageous.
Hey Doug love the video, but your statement about previous Z06 models not having a new front end is incorrect. Starting with the C6 the Z had a larger grill opening, a small intake, and a lower splitter. The C7 also had a larger grill opening and a lower splitter. The Z has unique bumpers. The C5 however had no design changes up front.
I don't like wing
I don't like wing
Over price. Suck
I don’t like the rear headlights part, takes away from all the fine lines….everything else is nice though.
Proudly made in Bowling Green, Kentucky, USA!
I can’t even afford those wheels. I’m a peasant lol
Everyone watch this on a big screen! My God this car is amazing
The car looks cool, but it doesn’t look like it can rock climb very well. 🧗‍♀️ 🤔
Remember when vets were the poor man's sports car?
Remind me of that Ford
CHEVROLET Should Know Better Than To Do This To A CORVETTE . This 2023 Is So Ugly I Wanna Puke
I can already see all the gold diggers wanting to get on this car.
Wish u let that exhaust sing a little louder for us
flat plane crank V8 engines this big for a road car are a marketing gimmick -  this looks like it was styled by an eight year old
be nice if top side of side air intake run up to front following body line like the 61
Nobody gonna talk about how he literally reviewing a car in a GTA garage
So I guess the 75th anniversary will be out next year…
How tf are you getting your hands on a car that literally isn't even out yet unless your reviewing a prototype ain't no way the 2023 is out we still have 2022 to go through before more cars are announced for 2023.
Vettes have always been a great deal for the money. Dollar for dollar,it is quite possibly the best deal to be had in performance cars today (or ever !). Plus,it is incredibly beautiful. What a champ !
When the next yearnumber doesnt cut it, just slap another year on there, done.  2023 car in 2021
*Epic*
The C8 has always looked a little bit off, like a generic supercar. But with the Z06 aero package the car looks absolutely incredible, I just wish it was standard for the trim level
Behold, the all new Ferrari Cheapette Z06!
Z06 Gray and Red interior is for me ...
I don’t want to check out cars and bids doug
dealers are drooling thinking about the markup they're going to get
Awesome car! Doug is the best!
its missing a 7speed manual "save the stick"
Ugly, ugly black rims on a cool car. When is the spare tire look nightmare going to end!
i think im in love
Never been a corvette lover, but this one is... wow.
Take a shot every time Dougie says "regular ole C8"
The door popper on my avaitor if the battery does die will pop open for the one time use but you can't reclose it until the battery is replenished.
That red convertible looks disgusting wow I want
Doug the goat
sounds just like my GT350
Doug, you forgot to say that the buyer has the option to build their own engine, if they are up for it...  and if they do so, they get to sign it.
Congratulations Doug. You have had 300,000 more views in two less days, than the official Z06 video from Chevy. Kudos my man.
Nice video Doug, hope to see something related to the 240 280 Z's or the new one coming soon!!!! I own a 1976 Datsun 280z :)
Actually the c6 zo6 came with a different front bumper than the base model one
3:52 that was a fart!
Crap… I slept through 2022
I would hate to be the guy trying to fix a flat tire on those carbon fiber wheels :S
Meh,  The current Vette looks better.
Did you just casually skip past the carbon fiber wheels when talking about tire width. WUT?
Doug has mentioned the two packages so many times....I wonder if he's getting a referral bonus.
This is the high performance car that American companies should have been making a long time ago. Just amazing. I want one. Maybe someday I can afford one used. Good job GM on this project. I hope this is a sign where the company is going and don’t need another bailout in the future.
Pre-production car yes. But by the look of those bald tires its been around the track more than a few times.   Why couldn't they let Doug have a go at it:-)   As always great review Doug
Thanks for the review.  Opinion: Yuck. Chevy please stop with the ugly center exhausts.
Why release 2023?, it's not even 2022
4:21 I see Jackson Storm from cars 3 all over this back bumper
Still looks like an angry mess, but it does look better than the C8.
Engine builder: Brian Walker = Brian O’Connor + Paul Walker
At 38 seconds pause how is that Camaro only 1100 dollars??????
"Thhhhhiiiisssssssss" So satisfactory😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm so happy for you Doug. I hope things keep getting even better for you. This C8 Z06 is just wow
The C8 looks like a Ferrari... yet the C8 Z06 somehow looks like a Lamborghini
Dodge enthusiast Viper petition👇🏽
I can't believe Doug missed/ignored this quirk.  Racecar engine, wing, body kit...and runflat tires(see ZP on sidewall)?!? No way should an extreme track performance car like this be saddled with heavy, stiff sidewall runflat tires.  I can't believe Michelin even makes a runflat Cup 2 R.  It goes against everything else on the car.  The bean counters must have decided that they had to avoid the potential lawsuit when Karen gets a nail in her racecar tire and gets stuck on the side of the highway and she and her support animal sue for emotional distress.
Z06s have had a unique front fascia since the C6 and a unique rear fascia since the C7.
Why did his "THIS" at the beginning sound like Borat? lol
Hey hey they finally made a car as fast as my Kawasaki ZX-14 Too bad i'm going the Nitrous way...
If Batman needed a loaner, this might do.
Its not even 2022 got damn lol
Too bad GM will be out of business in a decade. Hopefully Tesla will have enough cash 8 years from now to just buy GM and keep some of these classics in circulation.
hopefully that color looks better in person...
Looks like a hornet, the insect.....................
An american F430
Another super job by Chevrolet it looks and sounds amazing!
Maybe the last Corvette running exclusively on gas?
My most significant takeaway from this video was when I noticed the brake pedal; despite being an automatic the pedal is offset in the footwell to the right as if room is being reserved for a third pedal. 😁
looks like a mid 2010's lambo tbh
All if the hand built engines for the Z Vettes have been getting this treatment since the C6
What an amazing car! But I do have to ask you something Doug, do you ever breathe? Lol! Seriously! I’m a woman and even I don’t talk that much and that fast.! 😂🤣
Doug should have been in the video from Chevy and not Amelia.
Z06 spyder for me.  I will be debt free by the end of the year and ready to start saving up for one.  It will be a life long achievement ever since i got my driver license  and first job
If you are not trying to make money to afford these cars, then i wonder what you are doing here. If you want to start the money making journey but don't know what to do or how to do what to do, then Harvey Carey is the guy for you. I was holding on to money thinking i was reserving or saving up little did i know that i was making the wrong thing ever. Invest with Harvey today and start smiling. It has been working for me since January when i first started trading with him. Never have i ever had reason of regrets
chalk it up to pre-pro but the orange peel at 6:15 is brutal
If we have more honest and well meaning people as Harvey on earth, the world would be a better place. I'm grateful for the courage to chat him up last month. Now i make over 250% everytime
Wait….does the z07 package include the aero package? I think he forgot to mention that
👆👆👆If feel so proud finally following the advise of my collogues in chatting Harvey up on Tel e g ram. I just made another $43,000 👆👆
The revs were really disappointing 😞
Talks about underbody quirks  Doesn't put a camera under the car
Chevy really messed up the rear end. It's so basic. I hate the tail lights. They really could've made the rear of the new Corvette look incredible, but they didn't in my opinion.
I honestly prefer the C8 base front end…..
ZO7 on wheels should be a thing.
u pay thousands for milli seconds difference, are there really people do that?
HUGE REAR WING? VIPER ACR SAYS “hold my beer”
15:00 last time Doug mentioned he enjoys more writing than doing videos.. and here is the proof.
Too bad it’s ugly
The Z06 with the Z07 option will look great outside my 60 year old dentist office.   To put the high peaky engine of the Z06 in perspective, 460ftlbs of torque in this new Z06 track Corvette is significantly lower than top ultra luxury SUV’s from Germany like the BMW X7M50i with 553ftlbs of torque? 🤫
NO MORE REVIEWS WITHOUT DRIVING! I am still waiting on your test drive of the Ford Maverick.
Thhhvvviiiisssssss
it looks ugly to me! Also i think it will not age well ! Corvette needs new identity!
Another interesting addition with the C8, I live in Bowling Green where the Corvette is made and if you do order a c8 custom, they will have a photographer follow your car through production and give you a photo book album of your car being made.
The Dodge Challenger hellcat has more horsepower
For some reason I like this look better than the regular C7, except for the massive wing.  Now. let's be honest, if this car had any foreign logo on the hood, it would be in the $300k range.
Will there be a Grand Sport for this C8 Generation ?
Dealers are gonna be charging 150-170k for these
lol, the 2023 and it's still 2021... these manufacturers...
There is something about the C08 Corvette that keeps me from loving it. Performance, styling, price - all fine. But the new gen has a generic design, nothing at all that is distinctly Corvette. This could also be a Lotus or an Acura.  The Corvette simply is no icon any more. But just like the New Countach, potential clientele does not seem to be interested in purchasing a design icon, but to show off in the city center and make sure they have that extra bit of HP to separate from the rest of the bunch.
Not a Corvette fan.  But I liked the c8.    This one reeks of fat 'merica baldness though.
Nothing like a face full of carbon splinters if you crash
your salivating like a puppy dog !   and for what !?? .. 5.5L  vs previous 6.2L  that made 620Hp at much sooner revs with over 200ft lbs of torque more at much lower revs ! ,  .. my bet is the c7 zo6 beats the c8 in drag
He may not be able to drive it but someone definitely burned those tires out.  How can you not?
It’s interesting that they chose the 2023 Z06 to sport the 70 year anniversary badge.   Seems like that should go on BASE model C8’s and the Z06 should have a 60 year anniversary badge since the Z06 package was first available on the 1963 C2 stingray. Pedantic distinction, I know.  Cool car, though.
Most like an ad that I've ever heard on this channel. Sweet ride nonetheless
I think that canard on the front splitter is most valuable as a sacrificial shield to keep you from curbing (presumably) more expensive CF wheels.
They should have placed the Wing ontop of the hood, now it looks absolutely weird
It does look like a Corvette though. How do they do that?
I asked Doug for a Christmas present and he sent me an owners Manual 😭
Those wheels are awesome 🤩 I wish I could afford the car. I will have to work harder and get it.Great review video ✊
Me acting like a miss behaved child at Walmart 😂😂😂 drive it! 😭Drive it! 😭Drive it! 😭 I think you get the picture 😂😂😂
Dang..so many nice amazing cars out/coming out.  If I was a millionaire it's like being a kid in a candy store
They nerdy dad guy is one the best car reviewers in the world
You have the worst thumbnails
C8 corvette is cool, but I hate yellow on cars.
Doug the type of dude to give his wife a daily Doug score
I have never been a fan of the C8 (Im not calling it a Corvette cause i think they should have called the Mid Engine something else) and the looks of this one are even worse! It looks Horrible, the only think i like about it is the Interior ! very cool
Most GT3 race cars share the same engine architecture with the road cars🤦
I hope they find a way to go back with the 4 round taillights in the future.
That rear wing is very ugly, the way it dips so drastically in the middle just doesn't look right to me.
That yellow looks amazing.
A true work of art
3:01 The car looks like it’s smiling 😁
Ma quanto è brutta! Ma chi la compra un auto così brutta?
What the hell kind of colour is that?!!
My motorcycle cost 90% less and will still beat it.
Whats the difference between the Z06 and Z07???
shade of yellows on camara change?
It’s not even 2022!
Man Chevy is doing awesome things in Detroit. A FLAT PLANE crank DOHC 32V V8. Wow! I’m still smiling 😊 with the move to mid-engine. This is the best engine coming from the USA. I’ve had the latest C8 come through my garage and including two older generation Vettes. This is truly the ultimate Ferrari Corvette.  I also own a Ferrari F430 with an upgraded titanium exhaust system. The Ferrari flat plane V8 has this screaming sound that makes people cry with joy. I’m really excited to hear the sound of this new Vette engine. I was looking at buying a McLaren to add to my collection but this new Vette may go to the front of the line.
This car is mine
Hopefully They'll Solve The Transmission Issue They're Currently Experiencing Before Launching This Z06 Version Of The C8!
Not the American lambo
So they make a car for rich people who drive it on a race track. When R they going to concentrate on a car a 24 year old can buy with a regular job like in the old days.???
Yea, Yea, Yea,   I'll keep my 2013 Prius.    Rides fine.
One of best performing cars on the planet with a malibu interior!!! Haha
T H I S -----------------------------------------------       Hi Doug.
Damn your voice annoying
The last gas powered Corvette
"..enough to remind you that you are NOT just in a regular old C8, like some plebian".  I love it !!!🤣🤣🤣
That manual release looks like the one on the c6s lol
Anyone know if the convertible weighs more then the coupe????????
Nice shirt! Also jazz hands all day!
Time to cash in on some crypto 😌
Great video
The base c6 and c6 z06 had differences at the front.
Dude it’s not even 2022 yet
Did he say 0-60 in 2.5sec dammmnnnnn  that must be a rush....
It’s something I like about & it’s something I don’t like about the C8 corvette.
4:50 Amazing how a car released just hours ago has tires that really worn out !
Imagine what the C8 ZR1 will be like
The Z06 has had hand built engines for well over a decade. Name plate and all.
Pieces of art
Can’t wait to see what the Hennessy guys do with one of these
lmao all that noise and pollution and still cant beat a tesla
So much wrong info on previous model differences.  Sounds convincing like the Mach e review.
Flat plane check  V8 check Reasonable price check Ferrari shttng themselves? Check LFG
Great, every time I get road head my wife is going to bump every fucking button and all the sudden I have swamp ass from the heated seats coming on while she gobbles the knob. Maybe there should be a button cover that magically appears when road head mode is activated after all this is a super grand touring performance everyday guy car or whatever they’re trying to market it as think of us putting that 30 mpg to the test when you develop stuff Chevy not everyone chooses to pull over. See y’all in Carlisle I’ll have mine there but it’s like a 6 minute drive so no road head that day.
Loving the shirt. Gold!
its probably coming out at 135k plus a 30K dealer increase in price.... $165 probably plus tax... truthfully its not that great looking.... give me a Ferrari or Lambo
Does the Z07 package include the Aero package?
Dougs the type of guy to wait at a crosswalk when there’s no traffic
Doug is like if Nardwuar interviewed cars
im gonna be pissed if someone buys one of these and isnt even gonna drive it
The Zo7 package is a must if you buy a Zo6 imo. The aero additions make it looks much better
American cars are actually better than the Germans nowadays   I saw 3 broke executive assistants driving the cheap CLA Benz on the road.   Too many german cars on the road   Back to American we go !
I'm ordering one.
You can widen and move the camera Doug so the wing will be at the very bottom giving you a great rear view.
I wider why he says wider so much.
No burnouts?  Oh well...
Chevy finally got it right
Amazing Car...Cannot wait.
Whas there a fart at 3:54 🤣 or em i hearing things
"thiiiiis is the generic supercar design"
*Chevrolet
0-60 in 2.5 seconds vs. standard C8 at 3 seconds but yeah it's a lot faster, give me a break! LMAO
omg... its smoking already...
That rear is nice but for some reason, nothing beats the Testarossa rear. So distinct. Or maybe because it's on Outrun
Let's add 2 more cylinders and call it the LT-10 and drop in the ZR1.
Glad you got to review the press car this time before it is out. Guess your more than just an influencer now. 👍 you the man Doug.
I just wish it was manual
Doug you're wrong about previous Z06s not having a different front end from the standard model.
Im proud to say i work at Gm especially when they release stuff like this. So bad ass!!
The new "Plastic Pig"....how nice.  PORSCHE...THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE....
Props to Chevy on the engine and performance, but these C8s are hideous. I want to loke them a lot but they are ugly and in person even worse. Leave the mid engine cars to the Italians. What an ugly Corvette.
What a crappy and pointless car.
One day.
If this is the Z06 then just imagine the ZR1!!!!!
No thanks
Ugly car, boring power plant. Yawn….
This shit screams pretentiousness. And they still came short in the horsepower department 😂
I love Chevy , but this design is poo 💩
Horsepower is a fake number. The only number that really matters is torque.
I actually like the regular zo6
What, no road test ! bummer.
i don't get the carbon fiber craze
I never ever wanted a corvette.   Till now
This thing is gonna be expensive with the Z-O7 package and carbon wheels..  I’m drooling though, no doubt.
Corvettes are JUNK. I have had 4 in the past and everytime i was dissapointed when i compared to German cars. Last i owned was 2016 ZO6. Never again..no prestige.
Nice Vette!  Thanks, it's 2023. It ain't even out yet. But I know some people that know some people that rob some people.
But does it come in black?
2021 isn’t even over yet but...  THISSS is the 2023...  The world is heading for an iceberg.
This is why they wanted people to not be able to tune the c8 ecu
I am not a Chevy guy but that car is so badass. Wish you were able to drive it and let her sing. That engine whales and howls and sounds realllllly nasty and good. Good job Chevy. Well done.
I need one badly
The car is an American aventadotr in the best way possible
That particular yellow is not doing that car any favors. They should offer the yellow from the C8-R. I also wish they would offer a polo green like on my ‘96 LT4 6spd. I wish I could afford this new Z06 but I would not get the Z07 package. The standard rear spoiler is just MEGA cool and simply beautiful. Just add the ground effects and carbon fiber options for me. Whichever color, just not this yellow.
The price?
If only it weren't hideous...
Ugly as f*ck, ew. America shouldn't make supercars
stop allowing dealers to put 30k to 40k mark ups on the c8 chassis. a 68k sticker price with a 110k before tax wtf ? honestly chevy your making 1400 corvette a month and allowing this
The color is terrible on many of these cars. Anything neon from the ones I’ve seen are ugly. This car is slowly growing on me still prefer front engine but the Z06 in some colors are nice. Some of the resigned areas have helped.
They still need to fix the styling on the taillights.  Go back to a dual circular/halo shaped tail lights
Enough already. Give us the Doug score and it better be perfect all the way down Doug.
Chevy...TAKE MY MONEY NOW!!
How many times did Doug say ZO6 ? Who counted 🤔
All of this dope stuff on it but it still has orange peel paint
No drive booooo
Why are my pants wet?
Let it warm up before you rev it ffs
Not sure, but I'm assuming a naturally aspirated Chevy engine is going to be more reliable and easier to work on than a forced induction hybrid European engine. I hope Chevy doesn't go into a recall frenzy and I have to eat my words.
Drink every time Doug says wider
I saw one of these on a truck in flat grey and it looked insane
He needs to review the new Nissan Z.
I'm so glad to see GM and Ford back to making exciting cars and trucks.
Commenting for the Algorithm. More People Need to See this Masterpiece
This is a fucking beauty oh my lord
Price?
Wooooow sound 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿🙏🏿💪🏿
Interesting, but why shrink the engine?  The big complain is going to be lack of torque.  Needing to spin the engine to the moon for power?  Gets old quick.
but it is ony 2022 for two months
The Aero Pkg. is an option that includes underbody rakes that the 2005 Ford GT had standard.  It usually takes a decade or more for GM to catchup to Ford.
Dude how is 2023 out its 2021
The spacing between each exhaust pipe is off and it really bothers me
The regular z06 looks way better imo.
GREAT REVIEW THANKS 😁😆
Wonder if you can get the steering wheel with BMW M colored sticthing🤣🤣🤣
I think everyone reading this should send me one dollar so I can live out my mid-life crisis in style. Hear me out, im bald, short and work as a salesman. If you had any empathy you would do this ...or at least kill me.
Interesting they went NA vs. forced induction
Imagine being on a waiting list for a C8 for years then decide you'd rather wait another couple for the Z06 🤣🤣
Too bad its price will likely be inflated compared to the planned MSRP. That's what happened with the current Z06, that's like 50-60% more than it was new. I'm curious to see how it drives, but my perfect garage would be a tuned 2015-2018 Audi S8 and maybe one of these! It looks awesome.
The side scoop accent looks a lot better on this z06 than on the stingray. The c8 is still not a pretty car by any means. Chevy blew a chance to make a really beautiful exotic. Their exterior styling team needs a good slap and a tour of the Ferrari or McLaren design studio. Thank goodness for some of the outstanding aftermarket C8 body kits I've seen. And I'm really curious as to what the zr-1 will bring.
Overall it looks just awesome, but it did not sound good at all. Was that a limiter? It sounded like 2000 RPM, not 9000... COnfused!!..
I wonder if Doug reads user manuals to DougJr as bedtime stories
why 2023? is it joke?
Engine plack : Best of Brian oConor and paul walker
it sounded so bad in that little exhaust clip LOL
Sadly soon all combustion cars including classics will be banned from public streets in entire EU and Scandinavia  :-(  In Germany the Green Peoples Party gave order to shorten fuel supply from 2025  on by reducing all conventional fuel stations to only one state operated central gas station per city or county. Now they want to slow down all the gas station pumps from 20 litre per minute to 2 litre per minute...From 2027 on in the EU certain car spare parts will be banned too....as exhaust systems, turbo chargers and even some engine and gearbox oils...California and New York will do the same from 2027 on.... So no investments should be done in oil burning cars any longer....They even created a new kind of crime here, called emissions and smoke crime. "Bundesabgasbespaßungsverbotsverordnung" in German.
At least Doug is not sweating anymore.
186 mph sounds low when the normal c8 does 194
I still like the C7 better
Wrong on the exhaust..
I feel sorry for the people who purchased the regular C8… because you knew THIS was coming. Let me know when the C8 ZR1 and the C8 ZORA (1,000+ HP) come out!
And dodge is just in the background like, yeah we put a hellcat motor in a truck
Can only imagine how much the dealer markups will be on this puppy :/
the exhaust is lame sounds like the 16 year old kids down the street Honda with it's bumble bee muffler what a joke
Everyone who bought that underpowered corvette this year is pissed 😂
The whole “track focused” mentality and hype needs to chill out. In the US, many more race tracks close per year than open, and only a small number - across the entire US - will allow someone to just drive their unmodified street car onto the track and take it for a spin with their state driver’s license. Just like SUVs we know 99.8% of these will never see peak performance in the environment they were designed for. These things will only make the trip from the garage to Cars and Coffee and back.
Cost me 600 dollars for tires on my sky redline. Tires will most definitely be over a grand for this lol. That won’t matter for the characters that can outright buy the car. The ones that get financing for it may sweat a bit on tire purchases
Grand sport when?
"Flat plane v8, some rivals have used it"  Umm you mean any v8 developed in europe in the past 30 years?
That wing looks like a flimsy Pep Boys knockoff.
That Vette is prettttty
The Doug DeMuro drinking game key words: huge, carbon, Z06, and upgrade.
Imagine if they made one with a sequential GB and a clutch right out the factory 🤤
Damn too bad they gave you a yellow one to review 🤢
Why some many fkng adds damn it
nice Ferrari
Now why didn’t figure you would get 1 million views on this particular vehicle? Duh!! Lol
Too bad it's a Chevrolet though
It's a bit like a yellow Lamborghini...🤔
Wait wait did i just see a 2016 camaro for 1100 bucks
I wonder what the ZR1 will be like.
13:33 is your startup 🤤
What a beauty
Thanks for not saying Zed. How do they say the alphabet? W, X, Y, and Zed?
How much?
It’s a super car, fuck what everyone else says.
YOUR CAMERAS SHOWING 2 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT YELLOWS DUE TO TERRIBLE SATIRATION SETTINGS MAKES ME WANT TO BREAK THINGS.
Love what Chevy is doing here .. I hope they come out with a full C8R Track car option.  Like an ACR, Huracan STO, Porsche GT3RS .. Give us a full striped out big wing carbon copy of that race car.
I guess RiP the old Corvette design...now it's just a Ferrari knock off...
Can't wait to see these at Carlisle next year
theyre releasing 2023 cars already and we're not even in 2022 yet
After seeing the car in anything but yellow, I think it's absolutely gorgeous. Especially the interior. But that yellow is horrendous imo
2023? What year is it?
It's ugly.
Just get the R8.
Call me silly, but it sure would make a lot more sense to install the wing on the engine cover itself and not the body of the car, because it is very obtrusive either way plus you don't have any room for your fingers to lift the cover unless you go around the side. All they had to do was mount it 3 inches forward and that should be it. And seeing as how it's made of carbon fiber, it wouldn't add any appreciable weight to the cover so it wouldn't hinder the up and down operation and it would give you something to hold on to when opening or closing. Why don't they think of little things like this?
186 mph is not that impressive at all compared to other supercars. Even an Audi RS3 is faster. But eventually it’s the acceleration that counts. 2.5 seconds. Not bad
Im going to miss that REV as lame EV take over
Imagine when the fanatics supercharge this beauty 😈😈
Dougs vocabulary isn't getting any "wider"
Doug king of dorks
this guy so annoying with his hand wobbling everywhere
The rear wing just could have been attached to the hatch, Instead of that bat mobile looking thing.
Awesome Doug! I can't wait to see the Nurburgring lap times!
You are a moron.  The C7 Z06 is wider than the Stingray, and by like 3".
It needs a manual
Isn't the engine the most powerful na v8 produced by by a mass manufacturer?
Impressive car, except for the stitching in some places!
NO ALCANTARA PLEASE!!! Or at least on nothing you touch more than twice.  Want your car to age to fast and look worn out way before its time?...put alcantara on the steering wheel or shifter or seat or dash or armrest.  Just who was on the committe of yutzes that foisted that stuff on the public anyway?  Also to me, when I touch it, it just feels like the greezy equivalent of dragging your fingernails across a chalk board.  Ugh shiver.
Wheels are beautiful. Reminds me of Koenigsegg Agera RS wheels
50 k over sticker  lol
cool design
It’s not even 2022…
Newest video I watched!!!
Can you rip off Lamborghini anymore
Obviously, Doug is a shill for anyone who would give him a car to drive.
OMG! The rear, sides, and front of this Corvette are all ass-ugly.   YECCH!
Take a shot every time Doug says, "Chevy says...".
its not even 2022 yet  wtf
DOHC... with little 🚀emblems stamped everywhere on the engine.  Shades of Oldsmobile's Quad-4 & Cadillac's Northstar are evident, especially once the starter location is revealed to be under that twin throttle body intake.
front end... wth is goin on in there
C8 prices will fall when this drops
Do you really need rear defrosters?
After these Z06's w/ the Z07, Zora and Zr1 become available, all other C-8's will be called the "Homeless Person's" Corvettes.  {0.o}  😂😂😂
Jaguar next?
Tailgate?.......TAILGATE?!!......{0.o}......Oh and Doug has already forgotten that the steering wheel shape is called a "Squircle".  SMOTHERPILLOW HIM!!  😂😂😂
Waiting to see Ford’s response.
What is this sorcery? A 2023 car in 2021? Does Doug have a time machine?
Can't wait to drive this... In a video game xD
the color is epic….
In a way it marks an exit from the no replacement for displacement mindset that American cars seemed to have. DOHC, flat plane cranks, high revving and god forbid smaller displacement. Just shows how modern technology can take a car to a whole other level
“ You can review it but don’t stop talking about the aero package & zo7 option”
Regular zo6 wheels are way better looking then the carbon fiber wheels, and the gt350/500 has better looking CF wheels also
Mid engine sports car:should a man spend more than 300k on a ferrari V6 turbo engine, or spend a HALF to get a screaming n/a V8? Ferrari, bye bye..
Didn't know that in the US you can get a car from a model year that's at least 15 months ahead in time :D
Soft rev limiter?! Map that one out ASAP after collecting it - let the engine sing at standstill. After all, you know it will just from the gorgeous idle note.
Just noticed Doug caved and finally made some shirts, despite saying he didn't want to
I hate how the profile shot of the front end makes the car look like it's chewing a mouth full of food.
يا إلاهي ما أجمل صوتها انها حقا متوحشه I love vette for ever ❤❤❤
i just clicked to hear THIS
The color looks so different from camera to camera
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That's sickkkkkkkkk!
*I Actually hate that long line of buttons standing up in the middle of the car like that. it just seems so out of place. everything else is streamlined and tastefully understated and then your interior controls for ac heat and such are all on this weird blade standing up out of the middle of the console. NOT A FAN! if they put it down flush on the dash it would be just as accessible and functional but it would look SO MUCH BETTER*
this is a Z06 and Z07???? am I supposed to be confused?
For somebody who wants a hypercar at a fraction of the price of a Koenigsegg or Bugatti, just add blowers and a tune... 1200hp should do the trick.
I just gotta say at 9:00 it really does look like one of them videos where you're about to walk up to the camera and pick up the toy car 😆
It looks soo generic. But it sounds soo European.
They could have mounted the wing on the trunk. Many cars do so.
Can't believe the Corvette's finally gone OHC... much less DOHC...
7 grand just to change brakes on this car.
Look like GM ready to take down both Hellcat and GT500....
I'm super straight.. But I would sell my ass to buy this car.
This is one of those love/hate videos. Came here for the acceleration grin. No grin.
If I ever get the Z06.. I know to not get that color
Here before all the youtubers try and be the first to (turbo,widebody,rims)
1 million views! 🎉
5:58 Huge Carbon wing is Huge 🤪🤣
Doug, aka Mr. Jak'da'fuk'in!
So after dealer markup, it should be priced slightly above a McLaren
This is the only car review page I watch
Doug the type of guy to wear socks and sandals in the snow
Imagining what the C8 ZR1 will look like @@
Funny they put a voodoo motor in it to make it cool lol
But the tesla has morr power and seats 4. Come on 670hp is trash for the money. Loud and slow is not something I want for 120k. Do better. I expect at minimum 850hp.
The change in the car's color with the different shots is killing me
I trade my ex for a new one with a wider rear end
I’m just curious why they would call it the 2023 Z06🤣, why not 2022 if it will be released next year??????
Its not even 2022 cars are a rip off lol
Can’t wait to see the videos of Plaid humiliating this Dino burner. Maybe that’ll get  Chevy to hurry up with the E-Ray. They’d destroy the world with that!
Doug’s the type of guy to explore the “quirks and features” of a 711 gas station bathroom
Hopefully by then shib will be at 1 cent so I can buy it lol 😂
It's reasonable to get excited about the flat plane crank but surely the quad overhead cam and four valves per cylinder rated a mention as well. After all, it is the first Corvette to have DOHC since the Lotus inspired C4 ZR1!
Pretty sure the sound is better your up talk. Sorry … just noting the obvious. If you want trash me back, I only drive a jeep Cherokee 🙂
How many times did Doug say, “Wider?” 😁
$ 200,000.00
FYI. The C8 steering wheel is known as a squircle, or squircular in shape. Just saying. Great video on the Easter eggs, quirks, and features Doug, thanks.
I need ❄️ tires. Do they even make them yet?  We’re do I put my snow shoes?
That line of buttons is a direct copy of Bugatti
The Z06 , Grand Sport and ZR-1 have all had different front and rear designs compared to the base Stingray and are known as wide-body Vettes.
They finally threw those pushrods out the door.  It's about time GM.
Someone needs to tell Doug's wife to stop shrinking his clothes in the dryer
I’m not sure how I feel about the front of it. Some of these cars are getting pretty radical…(cough cough BMW).
Ford is having nightmares in Dearborn and thinking about building another car to compete with the vette. the sn550 mustang is looking pretty outdated now even the gt500 with a dated interior and wants to charge 100k for a old platform with nothing else going for it but a motor. GM just destroyed Ford ecoboost lineup of boring plain vanilla vehicles
Nothing affordable about this dulce and banana.
Did any one see that paint you would think it would be wet sanded or some thing to get that orange peel knocked down some
Take a shot everytime doug says wider
3:15 they really got the venomous snake face down on that car fangs and all
This makes the C08 look like a prius.
I’m nearly past the Cars and Bids bit but is Doug finally going to speak well of the Vette? That be a nice change
now ! its a ferrari killer.stunning design
My goodness...can you just imagine the ZR1?
Hey man, there's black smoke coming out of the exhaust already.
Can the soft limiter be turned off?
tttthhhhhhis
Amazing. Needs manual
12:21 why does the c8R look so much better? The spoiler not being retarded maybe?
Hey guys I need your suggestion please. I’ve placed a deposit for a c8 stingray about 4 months ago. I was planning to get it with the non Z51 package since I wouldn’t track the car. I care about looks more than performance since I would just be driving it on the weekends. I was going to order a HTC, non z51 with all the carbon fiber options from factory and some market CF parts (lips and spoilers) . I was also planning to put some after market wheels, forgiatos which are like 7k since I don’t like the factory wheels at all. With adding the performance exhaust and front memory lift the price comes out to $83k before taxes. After all the customization with the after market wheels and CF that i mentioned I’m looking at almost $95k - 100k with tax etc. I was ok with all this but the only other thing I wished Chevy offered on the stingray was the adrenaline dipped interior. Lo and behold Chevy announced that on the Z06. I never planned on getting the Z06 but now when I watched the reveal the z06 has everything I wanted. It looks so aggressive just the way I wanted it. It comes like that from factory and I don’t have to buy parts and wheels  from various places and get them installed. The factory body , wheels , exhaust are all excellent. Plus it has the red dipped leather and better faster engine is a cherry on top. My main question is, Should I stick to plan a and get a stingray and customize it with aftermarket parts, exhaust and wheels or get the Z06 Which comes from factory with all the things that I wanted. Of course I would love to get the Z06 since everything I want is w from factory but I’m not sure about the price point. You think with all the options I want, will it exceed 100k ? Is it with paying more or just stick to the sting ray? Thanks in advance.
Huge boost of HP with no torque
this was a good opportunity  wasted to fix those lame rear arches.
I don't have the time nor patience but someone please count all these "widers" 😂
Correction Doug, the C6 Z06 had an intake vent that the base C6 did not have 👌🏿
The Wish Ferrari 458 made a 458 Pistam Just incredible LOL
I loved everything except the door release. I would expect them to make more of a weight conservation effort in designing but I guess 3700lb is light enough. I would've loved to see a basic door carbon fiber door with a strap for the release like the Aventador SV and SVJ with minimal function just to say hey we can make supercars too. Maybe We'll have to wait for the ZR-1 !!!!
Gotta see what dodge has in store next wanna get it but first need a Doug score
I wonder if that engine will fit a 96 impala
Doug "doesn't require pants" DeMuro.
'Murica
When I order my 2023 Z06 I'll make sure it doesn't look like a taxi cab yellow I went opt for the torch red hard top convertible with that new dripping red interior or the dark blue color with the dripping red interior even the black color with the dripping red interior would be nice so many choices but not taxi cab yellow
Front end looks like a damn mclaren
It looks like an Origami nightmare.
How does dude have a 2023???
regular C8 owners are plebeians got it 👍🏾
I gotta say, even though there's a Camaro-style lack of refinement to the exterior design, I am amazed at the boldness of Chevy on this general body.  Honestly, the previous body was gorgeous and nothing to be ashamed of.  This one is like when a Lambo sneaks off at night for a rough bit of fun with a Camaro.  I'd drive it, but I would feel crude.  It would be so fun I could ignore the judgement though.
interior nice
this car is the bvb est car for 2021 22  killer that yellow nice red too
Is the interior still cheap plastic?
so GM copied the 351w then they saw the potential of the ford voodoo engine and copied that too
More power baby!
This looks like a Lambo.
$225,000?
Doug I’m praying for a “thorough” z review
Thrilled you received another pre production car!  You deserve them all.
BEAUTY BEAST! 👍!TROTTER MY 💝
Price please
Really nice and I’ll take one! Wait…how much?
This to me feels like more of an advertisement than a review.
Ah yes the 2023 model from 2021.
Take a drink every time you hear wider.
And there is probably room for a twin turbo. It will be a monster :)
When are you gonna  review the  zo7
Here before 1 million 🏁 🏎
Wider and he likes the word, "massive" too don't he.
The c8r wing is better
Sorry Doug, the C7 Z06 actually had a different wider front and aero and air intakes relative to the C7 Stingray so the C8 Z06 is NOT the first time GM took that approach.
I can't wait to see what the ZO7 package is going to looks like
Since you barely mentioned it...  Is the aero package included in the Z07 package?
Z06 had been wider for quite some time. This is not the first time
Why not tell us the gas mileage, Douglas?
That thing look more like a Lamborghini than a Corvette, when it used to be a Corvette...
Where is the review of the citroen C6 ?!!!!!!!!!!
The changes to the side air intakes make all the difference!  Looks so much better than the standard C8.
I'd like for him to describe my sex life in full detail
They should just go with active aero
12:38 Brian Walker's engine builder plaque has a crooked bolt center on right, lol.
Pagani Zonda R has the best sound
i'm actually convinced the cars and bids part is just dubbed where he just moves his mouth and waves his arms around
Dealer price $189,000 🙄
Cool
Can you review amg  project one next?
This car's exhaust look SOOO much better than the dual square tips on either side the regular C8 had. It just looked so out of place.
I understand that automatic transmission are so much faster than a manual nowadays, but there is nothing like rowing through gears. Guess I’m stuck with my supercharged C5 Zo6. This is a beautiful car though! Love me a corvette.
Whoa they let u rev it?
Do the new Denali ultimate
Looks like a Rimac
2:55 It looks so happy!!
THIS… is the garage from Forza Motorsport 6.
A real Corvette has the engine in front and no wings  and was a car in it's own class, the C5 was the best looking Vette. These mid engine super cars are not corvettes and should not carry that badge.
Great video.  Did I miss it?  How do you get into the Z06?
Amazing!
I’m so happy they brought back that iconic corvette Exhaust ..
GM haven't made a reliable car since the 1960s. I don't care how fast it is, a Corvette is just another way of saying you can't afford a Porsche.
It sounds so beefy 💪🏽🤤
lol that piss yellow paint tho
I'm going to laugh if the regular C8 Corvette 0 to 60 and quarter mile you never know when the C6 ZO6 came out then the ZR1 followed the ZO6 was almost as fast hardly any difference between the two 30000 more ouch that seems painful and people actually brought it
Finally a new car with a proper motor, not some shitty electric that you have to charge all the time and that have no soul.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HdQSjCUuMJI
OMG......OMG.....OH MY GOD!... It's a F🤬ng Corvette 🙄
Unless you’re racing at the track these high-performance cars are worthless. Who wants to be tempted to kill yourself or others on the streets?
Fun Fact: Only 2% of Z06 Owners will take it to the Track !!
That awkward moment when an electric 4 door sedan is still faster….
The builder label should say..  built by Brandon!  Let's go BRANDON!
5:57 👈🏼😂 This Huge Carbon Fiber Wing is absolute Huge !!   Me: Duh !! 🤣
I don't think Doug mentioned that the aero package is included with the Z07 package. How uninformative
Only when your head fits in a wing its called wing otherwise its a spoiler..
Just want to remind everybody that C5 had half of its interior borrowed from mass-production GM models. This one has almost everything custom. What a step up. True contender to the best Corvette of all time, even in such details.
Wow gorgeous car does look very Italian though, not that that’s a bad thing.
Richard Hammond's dreams have now all come true!  Simply gorgeous!!
They put the exhaust to the middle 🥺😍
Can't wait for new ZR1
Please compare the Z06 engine with the 6.3 AMG that was in the SLS Black Series 10 years ago ... It was a naturally aspirated V8 with 630hp. Don't get me wrong ... but the Z06 has only 20HP more than the 10 year old Mercedes engine ... i don't know what is all the hype about this.
doug: this flat plane crank v8 sounds amazing *doesnt rev it*
Just what we need in a climate emergency.
With all the money Doug makes couldn’t he buy clothes that fit him ?????
🌝🌝
Anybody else notice that loose nut at 4:56? 😂
Still one of the single ugliest mid engine sports cars being built today.  GMs design language is terrible...ya know, they're finally ending production on the Camaro...finally putting us out of the misery of having to look at it. I'm sure this new "Corvette"  a very capable performer no doubt but Chevrolet just can't design good looking cars anymore...go back to front engine and leave designing beautiful mids to the Europeans.
this year I'll go as Doug de Muro, for the candies
I'm sure it will be an amazing car to drive and great value for money, but I find it a very unattractive car.
atrocious fitment
It’s starting to look a little better to me. At 1st I saw a cheap Italian knockoff. The cars shape isn’t right yet. It needs some sculpting in the hips, a little nip tuck here and there. Maybe as the more limited models hit the road they will start to look better. This one isn’t to bad.    I loved the looks of the C7 btw
Sometimes i wish you would talk about how you fit in these vehicles.
Great engine and otherwise great design but the lack of a proper manual transmission is very disappointing. This car had the potential to be great and still does but no manual transmission kills the fun factor.
Please review an Ariel Nomad
Awesome Vette Z06.
you know you doing it big when you got doug reviewing your car before it even come out
I’m surprised they didn’t use Multimatic spool valve dampers on the Z06. They’re used in a lot of race cars and GM even uses a version of them in their off-road trucks.
No manual transmission?  No thank you.
once i move to us ill get this for sureeee
What a surprise to see this here first!  Awesome scoop!
I got a wide rear end  Guess I am the sports model
So is it a Z06 or Z07?
With every new video uploaded, the caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaars in "Cars and Bids" becomes more drawn out. I suspect a few years from now, the first two minutes of a video will be spent annunciating caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaars (and bids).
I have a hard on watching this video
This nasty... But I would still take a CT5 Blackwing over it.  Sedans or Die!
cant wait for the zr1
Car is fugly
Looks good, but they messed up the sound in my opinion.  I would still want some American flare to the sound personally.  Ford's flat plane still sounds like an American v8, this just sounds like a European car, at least on video.
Much less than Italian ,German and British cars that hit simular speed
Differences in the cameras is insane and driving me nuts
If Marty mc fly would drive this car he would reach the timeless dimension...
Why does the color look so different? Looks like someone forgot to color grade their video... 💀
FORD WHERE FCK ARE YOU ON AFFORDABLE MID ENGINE CAR?
That car has a phat ass and baby bearing hips 👄
Whoa I am impressed GM.  The Styling Team hit it as well, the fully enhanced car looks very cool and organic, like a high performance Bird of Paradise.  The door-rear-quarter intake accent is beautiful and perfect, the rear wing looks like a bird, and the side sill and front fascia accents harmonize well; a fine creation fellows!
If it it could corner
187mph? Seriously 😐
They brought the quad tips to the center on this z06 - like the previous gen vettes - standard c8 has quad tips on each end of rear fascia
The Tesla S faster  than this Z06.
Thiiiiiiiisssssssah
lets see if after so many decades, they would stop making an ugly interior
See... I knew if i waited just one more year the z06 would be happening. And the fact its NA makes it lot more fun.
Looks way better in the pale yellow.  Your camera fail did them a favor.
i work at the factory... thing is a pos
Can anyone tell me what the difference is between "downforce" and "overall" weight???  🤔
I hope I can find a wreck one and swap the engine in the Camero ZL1 😎
Dude I'm still living in 2021, I'll catch up to you in a couple years Doug.
I'd love to get this car if it's electric. It looks amazing! 😊
Someone has been enjoying those wider tires.
Can I get the zo7 pack on the drop top
All those awesome changes and they couldn’t change the designs of the stupid vents. So yeah all that super technology but hey if you wash your car or get caught in rain your engine area will get all wet and dirty. I’ll choose the convertible any day.
flat plane crank will be bummer for alot of people lmao i can already see the "where is the V8 sound"
I’m happy with my c8 z51…… I need no more horse power.
wtf is C8 or C6? video is about Z06 and he keeps talking about C6 and compares it with C8
you are reviewing Z06, but talk about C6 wth men?
Doug! Why didn.t you start up the Z06? This car is at the Petersen Museum where you are filming. You were allowed 30 seconds of start up time with permission to REV the car up. 😔
"Chey says..."
The red convertible version looks so cool
Lol $50,000 markup when ordering at a few dealers later.  I’ll let the supply chain catch up and pick one up used as these will depreciate under normal market conditions.  Time is your friend.
Woooooooooow
Not a true 'rich-boy toy', but still expensive enough to attract the attention of people who just want fancy speed and a head-turning appearance.   There's a guy who drives truck for a company that supplies my employer, and he's a Corvette nut with a wealth of different life experiences. He recently took delivery of his newest 'vette. I'm not a huge fan of the model, and I can't swear to this statement, but I don't think that a manual transmission is available on any of these newer-generation Corvettes. I understand the 'drive' for technological advancement, but once Formula 1 cars went to paddle shifters the death knell was sounded for true sports cars. These machines are cool in their own right, but a manual transmission should forever be an option for purists who want to toe-heel brake, double-clutch, and interactively run through the gears of a car they actually drive rather than to be a mere pedal-pushing, switch-flipping passenger behind a steering wheel. The steering will be the next victim. Aside from acceleration and deceleration it's about the only element of the driving experience at this level that isn't yet fully dictated or majorly assisted by computer.   Juan Manuel Fangio is shaking his brain-bucketed head somewhere in the great beyond. ; ]
I need it in black with the Z07 upgrade. Lord!
The mid engine camero looks so much better   Tho I doubt it will get new motor
way to much of him saying "you can upgrade"
Where's the AWD?
Not gonna lie, no torque improvement seems pretty disappointing. especially just in terms of the entire model
Did they skip the 2022 model or something?
THIS
Accelerate Yellow is the worst.
460 torque???? Ewwwwl  I see they been hanging out with Ford high horsepower n low torque I ll keep my z06 c6 cam heads supercharger and wait for a guy to try me with his new c8 z06
No vamos?
Of allll the colors  like Patrick said Yellow is UGLY ) rim seems basic from afar
Stunnig !
THISSSSSSSS
“engineers spent 2 years designing the exhaust sound” nice to know GM is putting their engineers to good use.
2023? Seriously??
Since when the word WIDER become .. WH- ider   geebus
THIS DUDE GAVE THE BEST CAR EVER MADE A 39. Never forget.
aero package simulator
It's the Z07 package that really sets the car apart Impressive overall , but not sure about styling of the rear wing. That engine will be awesome on a track though.
Dodge been real quiet lately.
It's funny to hear "almost 500 h.p" as if that's not alot of power but then you hear 650 h.p. and can't believe it..  It's even funnier to think the $66,800 MSRP 93' ZR1 had 405 h.p. and added over $25k to the standard $41,000 Vette price. When you factor inflation into that price the $59,990 MSRP 2021 Vette is actually cheaper then the ZR1 ..
All that work and engineering and they finalize it with home depot nuts for the engine plaque.  Classic GM attention to detail
This is epic 
Doug you have to do a video on the Rivian truck!
Not usually a fan of bright colors but I do like that yellow
I don't understand how they could get everything else so right about this car and then screw up the rear end so badly.
-"Mum, can we stop and get a Lambo?" -"We've got a Lambo at home" Lambo at home:
Amazing review! Now imagine what the C8R might end up with! 5.5 turbo or supercharger? Or possibly a dual electric motor for the front wheels to make it E-AWD
Can't wait to see how it stacks against the Viper ACR
Starting to look like a Lamborghini up front. Yellow color doesn’t help lol
I’m glad to see they are ironing out the proportions. I’m probably the minority here, but I thought the regular/original c8 looked goofy from certain angles. The ass was to wide or the wheels were to small?… I don’t know, but it definitely was a turn off for me. This looks good from any angle.
Could you start a second youtube channel where you post all these same videos, just with the "THIS, is..." part edited out from the start? Youtube's user interface is such fail that it's impossible to skip that beginning out yourself and it's so annoying I'd rather forgo watching your videos altogether than subject myself to that torture.
wrong about the front end not ever being different the c6 zo6 had an air inlet
As always great content and the video was well done. This car is awesome! Thank you for the review.
Whoever says the base z06 looks like the regular stingray is probably hating.  I mean, it DOES look like the stingray, but WAAAAY sexier. The front, side, and rear profile just sits so perfectly to the ground even without the z07 package. I must've designed mine on the chevy website about 20 times (no joke). I played around with different colors but i always optioned the pewter wheels, black exhaust tips, carbon fiber 2 package orange brake calipers, etc. 🤤
How much ??????
Wow this looks great I just want the original rear light design for the icing on the 🎂
Doug the best car reviewer on the planet and no one comes close.
Wonder what type of 1/4 mile times we will see?  the Stock C8 can get in the low 11's as I am thinking maybe low 10's?
Cs188 is gonna have fun
I like the styling of the stingray more
Pos has a soft limiter and it sounds awful
Love the car, hate that color.
Doug, You and I are over 6' tall. I want to see you enter and exit the vett. I may never have this privilege.
I want on so bad but every dealer has 3 years worth of a waiting list or wants 20k over msrp. GM should just work directly with consumers to make it a seamless experience and cut out flippers.
Doug should add timelines in these videos for easy navigation.
Tesla Plaid says YAWN !
Lets be honest..... are we all not over car manufacture's advertising cars for sale to the public that they cant even make!!!  I am.
I think its ugly, especially with that aero package, no thanks, I would buy the regular C8, which is fast enough and much better looking.
Gotta respect the Vette......
That is the worst color for a sports car!!! There is no better way to motivate a competitor than a color that evokes fear and drives adrenaline than Yellow!!! Bees are yellow and people fear being stung and will out run the bees pushing them to run faster than they normally could. I can't even watch this video because a yellow corvette is outright awful!!!
I’m not impressed unless the price it’s at 70k
The depreciation rate is not beyond consideration!!!
The people upset that they didnt add much.... are just hating nothing more. From year to year of the same model no car company changes much unless it was to fix a mistake on the previous years. I dont get this hateful/negative culture we live in these days.
The color is hideous!
Nope, that wing is too big.  Looks terrible
Spiffy  alright.  Too bad Toyota didn't build it.
couldn't the wing have been put on the deck lid so it wasn't in the way when you opened it up? i assume they could have designed the wing to swoop back further if the exact positioning was a factor
Put that same engine In a c3 stingray... Update the interior with modern technology seen in new cars today, would be a pretty cool restomod.
Cant wait to see how this does against the acr Viper on the track i luv how chevy finally got sum 345 rear tires
The most noticeable change in the rear end is the four exhaust pipes in the center
The carbon fiber wheels are from Carbon Revolution in Australia. Oi Oi Oi.
The front looks like the face of a yellow jacket.
Did y’all know the z07 package came with the aero package?
Ok, you've convinced me. I'll get the ZO7 package, and also the Aero package..
By the time I’m ready to buy one it’ll be too late….we’ll have slipped into full communism and I’ll not have enough social globo credits for my bug pod allowance. Thanks Obama.
Chevy have done such a good job on this car🔥🔥
The bar has been raised!
The worst thing about Corvette for the last couple of decades, has been shiny metal/chrome- trim pieces and wheels. Glad to see they’re moving away from it, but the polished metal standard wheels are still too shiny.
NOOOOO! Where are all the DOG THE TYPE OF GUY comments???? That was the only reason i ever came here and now, i been gone for a year and the comments are gone??? People!!! Back to work!
The car is very nice! However that line yellowish green color with the black trim is hideous on this car. I understand you want to be noticed on the road. But Damn that combination. What ever happened to high polished aluminum or clean chrome wheels and candy color paint scheme. The C6 Z06, ZR1 was and still is one of GMs best combo ever! Go back to the bling GM and still keep the engineering sweet!
the electronic door handle is seriously ..."quirky".... like you actually have a mechanical one because its needed for redundancy but somehow they still thought they needed an electric one ? thats a funky design decision lol
ITS STILL 2021!! WTF
Can I get this car with a round fucking steering wheel?
There is gonna be a 2030 Corvette in 2022
You're not annoyed that hoovie sold all his cars someplace else opposed to cars. Bids..lol
I had to stop watching after 2 minutes, this guy is annoying as fuck!
Mid engine cars have become affordable to the middle class all too late. Electric cars accelerate rate faster, have higher top speeds and more features than combustion engine cars.
I feel that GM's engineers were held back by the people going "HURR DURR MAKE EM FRONT ENGINE AND BIG HOOD", and now they are literally making the best looking super cars right now. All the lambos and ferrari's looking like ass nowadays...
People complaining that the new Z06 looks too much like the Stingray, well, I think the C8 Z06 is the MOST different from a regular Stingray, I mean, the C7 Stingray and Z06 are basically the same, it's one touch here and there even if you add the Z07 package, the C8 Z06 is very easy to spot even from far, the front is different, the rear is different and has centered exhaust, the side vent is very different, not even mentioned if it has the Z07 package, then it's very different
Still looks shity.
I have developed a facial tic listening to you saying ZZZZZZ06.
Price?
Doug de murro traveling into the future. 2021 and he already is testing a car from two years from now. Can you test the 3042 miata? My family from the future would like to but one but there are no dealers in 3042 and they would like to know more about it before ordering from China.
What the hell is wrong with Doug? The way he talks has changed from a normal guy to sounding like some carnival ride or carnival game announcer, and he's now pulling his mouth to the bottom left and he wiggles his head like a wobbly pole in the wind. Did he have a stroke?
Now I really want the Z08 package!
2023???!! Its not even freaking 2022 yet
That is good car, i love it💖💖💖
About time the snobs over at Government Motors (GM) realize what a GEM Doug is for their business. Good Job Doug!!
Too complex design. Ugly car.
how can you get a 2023?  It's you know... like... 2021??
Piss poor yellow
You just know car companies have meetings about Doug when designing a new car.
Impressive car.
If it has a model with the automatic convertible I’m sold,  Even though people are gonna try flipping them for 200k for the next 3 years
460 lbft 🤨
Me: Alot of smile 😊per gal Z06 Corv: And less Miles per gal 😌
The front look like the bottom DENTURES of a person falling off. Too bad its previous version did not sell well they remodeled it and I don't think this is going to sell well either. It's value depreciate rapidly. Buy a BMW, Mercedes Audi or Porche instead with that money.
22:48
Doug is extra twitchy in the beginning of this review 🤔
they are blind because u can see the c8 and the z06 look nothing alike on the side profile, it just people love to complain to much when gm looks so good how they don't complain about dodge challengers and mustang that looks the same from 2007 until now huh, all dodge do is change the hood style but do they complain .nope , but chevy they love to
Let's remove 30 Million pounds of trash from the oceans together! Check out the Crowdfunding campaign #TeamSeas :)
So the reality is the car should be called the Z07?
Pity G.M. just doesn't have the ability or the resolve to make a reliable car anymore. Imagine how much greater and more profitable they would be if they could. I enjoy watching these super car videos....but I left G.M.`s unreliable and poorly engineered cars a while ago.
the yellow looks so dull on the main cam for sum reason
Doug, for next time .. I see you have 2 cameras . Please use the same type of camera for all shots as i am seeing 2 entirely shades of yellow which imo is annoying !.
Thing is beautiful but that shifter is god awful and would ruin the whole car for me if I made enough money to afford it lol
I actually think it looks different enough even with the standard Z06!
Holy shit this man is going places
I think I'd rather have a Lamborghini, js
Is it still push-rod?
So this is faster then a Ferrari f8 and is just as fast as a Lamborghini aventador?? Wtf
Am I the only one who thinks the car has an Evil Grin??
talk slowly man , overreaction not fair
It’s a crime that it has a soft limiter when it can redline almost over 9000
I wonder what the c8 zr1 is going to be 1000hp?
Such a ugly color........ Reminds me of baby 💩
Doug, You have the BEST JOB in the world 🌎👏🙌
Challenge: Take a shot everytime he says “Wider”.  I am not responsible for any injuries.
40 pounds weight savings rotating mass of carbon fiber wheels equals 160 pound static weight savings. So its like taking a person out of the car. Probably 1.5 tenth of a second in the quarter mile. Pretty impressive and worth the money if you track it.
How fast is it? extreme arm movements aren't enough, this is whole-body gestures fast!
These kind of changes don’t seem like they needed to take three years… This should’ve come out in 2021.
When ZR1?
Say twenty twentythree, not twothousandtwentythree.  It's not the aughts anymore.
I have a 1968 coupe in safari yellow. Little lighter than this. Looks nice on a C8
Thanks for the Chevy commercial.
2023 is false advertising. It was probably designed in 2016, finished polishing in 2019, and finished making it by 2021. Why would u put 2023 on the name? tf
How much??
Doug smokes crack late at night with black hores
I still don't get if the aero package is included with the Z07 package...
This is a super car
Can't wait for the zr1
The front view looks like an evil alien jackolantern.
4:29 Side vents need strakes! #needmorestrakebell
Hurry! Turn on teen driver mode before someone tries to make a tiktok video! Good thing KeKe isn't popular anymore
Forget the Lotus Emira waiting list, I’m jumping ship to the Z06
Kinda sad corvette is just gonna be another supercar soon. Base C8s are going for 100k, i cant imagine this being less than 200k with dealer markup.
is his shirt saying to Ford to bring back the GT40?
How can it be 2023 if we still in q4 of 2021? 🤷🏿
Such a shame muscle cars aren't for the common man anymore.
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
It has quirks/character.Rather refreshing in the world of boring cars.
Lol is this guy a drug addict?
These are not the same 😂😂
This design is an assault on your eyes.  All around horrible design.
Did Chevy just let Daddy Doug announce the C8 Z06?!?
HOLY MOLY YOU GOT TO SEE THE Z06?!?!?! YAY You have MADE IT!!!!!! Congratulations!!!!! Been following you for YEARS!
I’ll take 6
#LetsGoBrandon
Oh man. This looks fantastic. The little badge on the side almost look Lambo-esque.
Somebody has been driving this car, because the tires are nearly bald. Too bad Doug cannot drive it.
"this huge carbon fiber wing is absolutely huge."  That's the sort of detailed description I crave. Jeexus, Doug.
So this is the new Bumblebee.
it's interesting how vibrant the color of the car is on one of your cameras and on the other it seems rather less so. almost a paler color.
Amazing vehicle 🙏
Hmmmmmm Early 2000s Ford GT on his shirt while reviewing the z06?  Hehe interesting choice!
It sounds like v12 ferrari
Doug is awesome! He is the Tarantino of Auto presenters!
17:45 The reason the convertible is just as rigid as the "coupe" is because the "coupe" is not a coupe as far as the chassis is concerned. Both the convertible and "coupe" have a convertible chassis with no permanent roof piece. What would be impressive is if both chassis were comparable in stiffness to the coupe variant of what ever car you would consider is the Z06's competitor.
this was not the first z06 that had a plaque of the builder on the engine.  The c6 z06 did that as well.
Blatantly obvious that the GM PR team had the final say on this video, Doug. SAD!
ngl I like the standard wheel design over the carbonfiber one.
I'll never forgot what my old friend used to say when people wanted cars like this but were broke. "We got this great spark for you, got all the same things a steering wheel, see through windows, doors that open and wheels. "
Wow !  That exhaust sound is amazing. It sounds like a mid-engine sports car should.
I wonder how this car would do against the Ford GT on a track.
You know what's sad about all of these, all these prototypes and show cars just get crushed most of the time cause they can't sell them or market them as they are made before the car is officially certified by standards.
Looks Awesome! I  also like the fact Chevy changed the engine to a flat plan dohc design. Can't wait to see it in action.
So GM just copied all the successful ideas from all the MUCH better European compies make. A mig engine flat plane crank V8 under glass. Where have we seen that before?!?!  Oh GM, AMG wants their imitation name plates back. Fucking copy cats!!!
What's the torque?
Yes!! Much better wheels
Wow GM...and to think you used to make cars with red velour interiors. This thing looks incredible, great job to the design and engineering teams the fit and finish are excellent.
Haha a reasonable price car before a fricken 20 to 30k mark up
I'm sure that camera issue will get resolved post production
Finally a real life legitimate American super car, and it even looks the part….and not in a cheap way
Gee Doug, your head-bobbing, arm waving, elbow pumping really adds nothing to your videos.
flat out...... that engine is seriously the best selling point of the zo7 670bhp and a limiter @ 8600rpm from a na 5.5L v8 on 91 pump!? that is sooooooo cool. We need more n/a all motor high revving engines!!!! or the laggy top end turbod engines. I cant wait to see what this engine will do with some bolt ons on some race fuel and some ecu tuning.. or a big single turbski. Flat plane crank i know arent great for boost and high hp maybe a procharger would better suite this. I know the gt350 engine wasnt very boost friendly due to the flat plane. Either way it makes me so happy how they did the engine on this! stilllllllllllllllllllllllll thooughhhhh where tf is the 6 speed guys cmon.
Still an automatic.
This might’ve just saved or at least prolong the V8 era.
The exhaust tips were designed  to  push the exhaust sounds back towards the driver,
Absolutely LOVE this package. Except 1 thing…. No third pedal. I know its slower but, not nearly as fun.
"2:30" I know its not much different but the c6 z06 definitely had a different front bumper than the base models. Its an inch or so wider with the air inlet near the top (same as grandsports and zr1 but different than base). Great vid, love the new c8's but I think it would be quite some time before id move on from my c6.
Honestly don’t see the point of a Lamborghini or Ferrari any more
So GM finally made a V8 as powerful as a Ford V6. Nice.
Doug, where can I get THIS! T-shirt?
Doug knows the genesis etymology of PLEB !!!!!!
Still ugly. At least you get a snow plow on the front for those snowy mornings.
That wink/trunk lid combo might chop some fingers off.
Actually looks like a super car now.
I have been avoiding Zo6 videos until Doug did his.
Cringing every time you say z07
Keep the styling, but make it electric and AWD!
Looks like car model years are outpacing the regular calendar. Or was it always so that the car is presented two years prior to its model year and starts sales a year prior to it?
The more I see this, the more I feel I've never seen a car that looks better than this. Purely based on looks I used to love McLaren the most but this looks even better and absolutely stands out from the base Stingray. Pretty sure it's gonna be untouchable in stock car performance too.
Most powerful v8 and only top speed 186 😆  and only .2 secs faster than base model and the base is 194 mph. Too much drag in the pumpkin 🎃  z06.  If you buy the z06 you just buy it for the sound that should of been in the base model which wont justify the price cause your paying for a hand made engine.  There needs to be a grandsport version screw the boring eray
And they planing to put all that power to the ground just using some michelin tires 😆
so i guess this means the zr1 will be 850-900hp
I have a huge spare tire which is why I have a much wider rear end.
Very impressive corvette indeed! Even compared to more expensive comparators! But still very expensive.
I don't care too much for it Corvettes are known for the American muscle front engine. And also downgrading the torque is a big no-no. I like the 2016 ZR1 or 2017 is my favorite all-time car in the world. I think Chevy downgraded on this one
If you look back at the C6 and C5 Corvette Z06, they didn't really make them look a whole lot more aggressive compared to the base model.
What’s the curb weight?????
I’m just not interested. This thing is a track car. I’m into cruisers. I like going across country year round. One of the things you learn when driving is your life is that performance doesn’t always equal reliability.   That being said if I had a breakdown while on the road. How many weeks will I need to wait before a replacement part comes in. I doubt anything on this car can be found at autozone.
Naturally-aspirate engine pumping over 600 horsepower never fails to impress me
Looks way way better
To me the regular C8 looks way better and I can't understand the ugly wing placement, why not placing it over the tailgate make it better looking less prone too rear damage and make loading easier?
If the obvious bullshit $60k MSRP of the C8 is true, I wonder how much over sticker this pile of garbage will be.
Wow at a glimpse I thought it was a Ferrari or lambo. Nice one Chevy 👌
Why didn't you drive a regular corvette and say your driving the zo6 kinda like you did that mustang. Idiot
The best info from Doug as usual.  I want this car...
Oh God - like the 90's Tbird SC, those wheels point different directions. It's the same wheel on the L and R, so they point forward on one side, and backwards on the other.
They still have issues with the interior stitching.  Some wandering.  Ferrari stitching is much more uniform.
If you're not driving it, I don't care!
Those exhaust pipes are so much better than the regular ones.
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23) you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that you need Jesus as your savior, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
Doug, don't be a gurney flap!
I know a lot of people didn't like the quad exhaust being inseparated brought it back together together look much better
It’s crazy to me that this thing will compete with $300k cars and it’s made in Kentucky
It's no Supra 😜
$99k
You know Jay Leno is going to get the first drive in this.
Yes over Jag, GT 500, zr1, Cayman 4.0l, GTR, McLaren c12
AMG GT tuned FF v12 R8 V10 No warranty, used 👇
I hope they use a good $5 glue to fix the dash in this exceptional car.
You already got one to review wow props  Doug
No matter how great the performance, the C8 seems destined to look like the Payless Shoe store version of Air Jordan’s if you get the analogy. I wish they would have spent more time on making this a beautiful car rather than just a bunch of random creases and vents.
Does he ever start it? Kinda jumped the gun by not being able to... you know, drive it.
Seems like it would also provide serious downforce to my bank account. 😁
Atrocious
I thought that was the lotus evora at.first
We ain’t even in 2022 yet how tf
2023? I mean is it the model number? Cuz it damn sure ain't close to 2023. Sounds stupid to me sorry to dis ur video lol
I've seen three of these and got a model to put on my desk all the time so when I actually buy one someday, I will look back and see how far I've come from just that small dream
Zero markup on the new Z06. I went to the third largest Corvette dealer in the world, located in Gaithersburg Maryland. This dealership among others guarantees no markup from MSRP. It's in the contract. That being said, he told me if I put in the refundable deposit now I will get a 2026 version. That's not a typo. I could buy three of these today but no way in heck I'm waiting 4 years for this.
The strakes under the car act as a venturi, they make the air under the go faster by creating low pressure under the car. A1V1=A2V2; P1V1=P2V2 where A = area of opening, P = Pressure, V = velocity. Yes I know I assuming a one dimensional flow, constant density, steady flow, no loss to friction, no stagnation point. For this example P1V1=P2V2  (where P = pressure, V = velocity) this is why a wing flies.  A F1 car is an upside down wing. Let’s call velocity over wing V1, and pressure there P1; velocity under control he wing V2, and P2. So, air over the top of the wing moves faster than under the wing; so V1>V2. For argument V1= 100, V2 =50. Let’s say we know P1 to 25 (I’m not ascribing the British or SI units for ease) but we don’t know P2. We can with the equation P1V1= P2V2, both sides of the equation have to balance.  By the equation P1V1=P2V2 we know V1, V2 and P1so solving for P2 (pressure under the wing)  P2 = P1V1/V2 P2 = (25x100)/50 P2 = 100/2 P2 = 50 so P2 (50) > P1 (25) the pressure on the bottom of the wing is greater, so it “lifts” the wing. For a F1 car the opposite is true: the air under the car is moving faster than the air over the car, thus because the speed under is greater, to maintain balance, equality and conservation the pressure will be less, and the pressure on top of the car is greater creating that important thing called downforce.  Downforce on F1 Lift on an airplane
This shape will not age well.
Damn Doug has hit big time. Congrats on another great review. This is first review I’ve seen on this bad ass Z
how does this not go 200?
Somebody get Dougie a new camera.  His thumbnail is ultra low resolution
Chevys “mic drop”/neck stomp on the entire industry. Mclaren charges what? Bahahahhahahahhahahajjahahahhhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahaahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaajjajajajajajjajaja
Not watching another 20 min. of Dough Dhee Dhogg Dhoo. Is Yellow the only color that car has? Look at that duct taped rear wing. Shameful, rear wings should fully retract. How gauche. Auto Fail.
The engine is much more than Munro discussed,
13:35 really?  Wow this is really disappointing..lol
Does he says Z07?
This... this is a super car. you cannot convince me otherwise. chevy now sells a super car.
Holy crap I love your shirt, are you selling shirts yet?
That's just a spoiler, not a Gurney flap. Look it up
TEAM!!! BUT THE TEAM easter egg is the best! <3 But yes the price point for sure. lol
Over years... Corvettes always were...meh, cool, no wow factor.... now, they are fucking hot... love this car, it's awesome and I want one.. and not priced other "supercars"....tempting..
Sorry Doug but the engine is not under the hood, but under the rear hatch. 🤣🤣🤣
That sounded like poop especially on the revs! Does it have crackle and pops?
Notice he did not mention  top speed
2021: standing in front of a 2023 car on sale.
0 to 60 is faster  but top speed is slower 186 down from 194
I'm very likely in the minority opinion on this, but I just find the C8 Corvette hideous. It wants to be a Lamborghini and fails to be a Vette or a Lambo.
I thought he was supposed to review the car for us, not try to sell it to us.
That spoiler 🤮
Theres a bolt at 4:58 thats not screwed in all the way. Good quality control, GM!
I’d rather have a 720S
This is gorgeous. Wow.
I'm pretty sure the c6 zo6 had different front and rear than the regular c6. Wider both front and rear also air intake at the front.........😒
I love the look of the Z06, i prefer the non aero personally.
Hey guys, just wanna let you know the z07 package includes the aero package. Your welcome
This car just shit 💩on the stingray 💯
This car is sick! Very well done Chevrolet!
Cars do not have tailgates
God is good repent Dios los ama God is coming Dios viene!
The c6 z had a different to the front over the base. Hood scoop.
Really like the way the rocker line flows up into the the reshaped side intake. Looks much better than the base C8 imo.
I remember when they wouldn't let him review the base c8.
Wow! You already got to it. And you're on trending too! Keep it up Doug!
Doug is the type of dude to wear his own shirt saying Thissssss....
Exhausts are back in the middle Doug...
Hi
Dough please review the 2021 Shelby F-150 Super Snake. That truck is insane!!!!
i feel bad for everyone that payed 50k over asking for their base C8
40 pounds of rotational mass is *huge*
I'm guessing you won't be able to get one for less than $250k with dealer markup
Looks like a yellow jacket
Wow…. That car is beautiful
How did he already get his hands on one?
I will swap this LT6 into a rx7 one day
Nobody who ever buys this car will be skillful enough to ever get any aero benefit from these modifications LOL.
Wow, I just want one 👍
Great review.
still doesn't sound nearly as good as the ford 5.2 flat plane crank
the more pale yellow color looks so good, I fear that is just the camera playing games though.
The color keeps changing between very vibrant to very dull.
11:50 The hp came from very high lift cams and high compression. The crankshaft has more to do with smoothness. 13:50 it sounds like a Ferrari with bad tuning.
I don't think using nissan playbook not going to work 😅
real nice car!   I wish it has more clean line like the Lotus Emira and less of the many crease / angular lines
Doug should do a video on a 1981-1982 greenwood corvette gto. That would be dope.
Its alright, I like my Mazda Miata better, Honestly
"Let's listen to the exhaust"in soft limiter 😆😆😆
C8 Z06 Corvette is not but wannabe ferrari design and ferrari sound

Of course the car has the same rigidity whether or not it's a convertible or not. It has a removable hard top lmao they already engineered it as a convertible basically
My MSRP prediction: $99,900
I love the approach they took with this new engine
WHERE IS THE DOUG SCORE?!,!?
The gap between the frunk/froot and the body work will make some noise when you’re driving.
I always liked the Corvette but never enough to lust after one. but man this one changes everything
20:05 I am vastly amused that the autofocus on your camera *explicitly* demonstrated the problem I have with camera/monitor rearview mirrors, by *staying out of focus for a couple seconds*, when you flipped from glass to monitor.  When a rearview mirror is a *mirror*, your eyefocus distance is that of the actual *objects outside the car*.  When you turn on the monitor, the eyefocus distance goes from that 20 feet or more to the 12 inches to the mirror panel.  That's hard even on young eyes, much less the ones that can afford an 80-grand Corvette.  When you're sweeping your eyes from left-side to rear-view to right-side... you're gonna notice.  And it won't be any fun.
Wow they didn’t let ol dougy boy drive it when they let Emilia Hartford drive it and Eddie X ride in it🤔………..someone’s lower on the totem pole than they they they are?! 🤭😆😆🤷🏽‍♂️
Enzo isn't just turning in his grave... he's on a veritable rotisserie!!
Start up sounds exactly like a 458, well done!
That yellow color fits its nickname. Dolce and banana
The C8 in any format is my dream car but this thing is definitely punching above it's weight. I love it!
"this huge carbon fiber wing is absolutely huge."  That's the sort of detailed description I crave. Jeexus, Doug.
Another great car review.👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾. Doug is truly a car enthusiast professional. Chevy NOW has truly made themselves a force to be recognized once again as the big boys of performance sports cars. I owned a 2014 Camaro SS and loved it. So without question I have to add a Z06 to my collection. Chevy should really thank Doug for sharing there new car with over 700k people in just one day.
I'm glad you stopped saying Z07 package after the first 5 minutes, I think you were trying to hit a quota from Chevy early in the video lol.
so they releasing models 2 years ahead of the game now ? gotta keep pushing the bar higher and higher i guess lol  looking forward to next years 2035 model =]
Ehhh....the "America only" guys can have it...rather have a Nissan GTR,when Nissan redesign's it
wow... is that what a salesman who was on crack and then drank two pots of "extra caffeine" coffee would be like in a car showroom?  i would NEVER own a Corvette past the 1971 model year and ESPECIALLY would never drive one of these new "whips and chains", "computer controlled", "transformer" Corvettes.
hey those tires have been used and peeled out in, who says the car can't be used or hasn't been? I call lies!
They definitely knocked it out of the park with the Z06 though I'm sure the starting price will be well into the six figures so I doubt most of us will be able to obtain one.
If dealerships were fair they'd be more affordable
Girlfriend upgrade … save 40lbs 🤣
‘Gurney flap’ … not so exotic now 🤣
All streetspeed717 fans now know exactly what Mike's will looks like 😂😂
Me: X's out of video at 1:15
Doug claimed a few years back in a previous video that he has never liked Corvettes. Unfortunately it really shows in this video.  He mentions this is the first Z06 to feature a different front to the Stingray/base model. The 2006 C6 Z06 featured a unique front fascia that was more square in design and incorporated a much larger grille for improved cooling, that utilized a cross-hatch style mesh. The C6 Z06 also had more squared off fog lights to match the more aggressive styling. Much different from the base model C6. Then again later on the 2015 C7 Z06, the front grille was a unique design which featured integrated brake cooling ducts. GM removed the chrome strip and had a cross-hatch design to help improve air flow to the radiators. Fair enough, many Stingray owners started to buy the Z06 grille or aftermarket replicas to fit to their Corvettes, but when it was first released in 2015, it was exclusive to the Z06.  Later he says how other car manufacturers have placed plagues on the engine and NOW Corvette have started doing it. Again the C6 Z06 in 2006, placed plagues on the LS7 motors as they were hand built at Wixom. The LS9 in the C6 ZR1 also featured plagues on their hand built motors and so did the LT4s and LT5s in the C7 Z models.   Doug’s videos are always fascinating, however bias brand preferences need to take a back seat in auto journalism.
Bumble Bee Reimagined
American and European exhaust hybrid note ;)
That beast should be in the next Need For Speed game.
13:44  car salesman: doesn't burn any oil. driven by old lady once a month the "230k real mileage" 1.4tsi golf's exhaust:
he's exhausting to listen to...
Not driving the thing? Come on, Chevy! Don't be so cheap!
3:00 Is that the NSX?
The way you talk drives me nuts and is so distracting. 🙄
Z06 side vent design way better than the original C8
When is Corvette going to make an all-electric high-performance roadster?
I can’t wait to get mine
Anyone know the date that we can finally place orders for these? My local dealership doesn't even know. I'm in Canada mind you that might be why.
https://youtu.be/pXDx6DjNLDU   #TEAMSEAS
Didn't know Chevy basically made Ferraris now LMFAO  This car is crazy, I need it so bad
By the price, this one is interesting, but just a shame it has so much cowboy style, that I'm not. But since I'm not an expert on style, I'm not going to judge, it's maybe sharm.
How well they've refined the cars looks is honestly the coolest part to me.
Still ugly. A Corvette should be a beautiful cool car. Like the 1986 Corvette Indy concept car.
Tacky, over priced, and this "performance" version's 0-60 time is still 20% slower than Tesla S Plaid. Sorry boomers GM is ☠️.
Just scrolling through you tube,  can lie b4  I read the title, I thought this was a Lamborghini!
ugly front.....
It’s not a big deal, Pal. It’s just a car. Relax. And stop saying “Thhhissss”
All of that just get beat by the Tesla Plaid…. A 4 door sedan 🤷🏽
The z06 is definitely amazing but they did you dirty by giving you the ugliest colour available
Doug, for those of us who love this car and will be ordering one, can you please share if it has a front driveway lift!?!
Meh.... it's kinda wack. the c7 z06 had more wow factor when compared to the c7 stingray. This looks like the same thing as a normal c8. Needs some flared fenders.
Whatever you did to colorize your video you somehow made that color look boring
Every time Doug says Z07, take a shot.
Can we appreciate the guy who built the engine is Brian walker. Like Brian O’Conner and Paul walker combined
What was that exhaust rev 🥲🥲 give her some gas please we want to hear over 2200 Rpm’s. Especially when you’re talking about it’s flat crank 8200 redline. 😭
Once he does an episode of him driving one, I'll watch.
Z06 def the best looking vehicle so far
It's now even 2022 and they show us the 2023 cars.
Jus saw one today tht was wrapped up in the hiding material that they wrap it up in....
Looks cheap & it's not .....lol yikes
Rear looks better
2023? 🤔
No Turbo or a supercharge just a V8. Thank you GM.
Made from General Motors, piece of shit.
333kg@300km/h? Wow this car is form over function
Most powerful naturally aspirated V8 ever. Fucking amazing.
You are always screaming :/
FUUUCK, ADJUST YOUR MIC PLS
Such a good-looking and great-sounding car!
My wife told me she needed a wider rear for improved traction through the aisles of Walmart. I don't believe her.
4:14 - 5:16 - 'Wider' is said 12 times . . . . that's once very 4 seconds - Crazy
C8 ZO6 will go down in history as highest mark up in mark up prices ever 😅
Honestly the fact that they can offer this with carbon fiber wheels is impressive on its own. I remember when there was only one or two carbon wheel types on the market and they were more expensive than a lot of entire cars are. Economies of scale have really made a car like this possible in a relatively affordable package and it blows my mind.
So I went through this whole vid just to see no head-snapping, balls to the wall driving excitement?
Doug - You are very animated with your body movements, is this acting (?), interpretation (?), 'visualised-exaggeration' (?) or a personality wackiness (?). . . . are you Okay ? It makes you look 'speeded-up', comical and Odd !!
The tailgate and wing is very similar to your c7 zr1 video
Orange peeled the paint from the factory (I know this is pre-production but GM...) - can't wait for AMMO NYC to get ahold of one.
That t-shirt though 😁
"This HUGE rear wing is absolutely HUGE!" Well, at least you're right. 😅
I feel the fact that GM went with the whole supercar look on the new corvettes, was a decision from a genius!
Y it 2023 when it ain’t 2022 bruh
_Always like these reviews. Granted, when the C8 was first introduced as 'invitation' only', poor Dougy wasn't  invited. Yet, later once the car hit the streets, he did a great review of the 2020 Chevy Corvette. I bet though that Jay Leno's channel will be the first to test drive the 2023 Corvette Z06. (Note to Doug DeMuro personally: would be nice if you didn't film much of the cabin in the dark...well almost. Great voice over work though)._
I don’t know what I find more impressive... that Doug was able to do a review on a car that was just revealed.... or the FACT that this video already has more views than GM’s own “putting the world on notice” Z06 debut video that was uploaded 2 whole days earlier than Doug’s review...
Doug is WRONG, the c6 zo6 had a front bumper air scoop where as the base model did not. Signifying a change In a zo6 front bumper design before the c8
Thiiiiiiiiiis, is an ugly color.
These cars are starting to look a bit silly
Can't wait to see which youtuber buys the first wrecked one!
A supersportscar Z06 with additional Z07 sport performance and brakes and seats track oriented package and fake'ish exhaust tips...that starts to sound and look like Germany and money grabbing from the customer! Does it come at least with disabled speed limiter (irony)? America, please don't go that greedy way...it should be fully loaded in standard! And If You ask about 2 yrs spent on the exhaust note I'd say it was 2 yrs wasted...
They have got everything perfect with this car!. Imagine kerbing a carbon fibre alloy though!
Doug, does the aero package come with the z07? 😜
The straight pipes called the steering wheel a "Squircle" which I think is the perfect name.
It's yellow?
I think I might have just saw a loose bolt lol
I’m sorry.  The C8 corvette just wants so badly to be an Italian super car, it’s just sad.  I know the Corvette enthusiasts will think that’s just horse poo.  Everyone in my town owns a new corvette and they are everywhere.  They are already no longer special.
That is one ugly car.  This is my opinion so agree or disagree.  For the most part, GM styling is so over the top look-at-me.  It's a vulgar display of exaggeration.
Why even offer the Z06 _without_ the Z07 package? Everyone who buys this thing is going to get that package lol
"That huge wing is huge" 😎
Looks great
Wow,Awesome
its ugly AF
It sounds good but there is only one car the Lexus LFA that has the brassiest exhaust note available to consumers
85k woowee that's a dent in the wallet.
Thhhiiiiissssss...
This is a miracle of a naturally aspirated engine
I amazed at what GM can create but they can't seem to carry over that quality and engineering into their other models and brands.
Love the new merch Doug!
@doug demuro the kind of guy that wears his own shirt
is it a zo6 or a zo7? or is it a zo6 with a zo7 pack? so confusing tbh
"MASSIVE rear wing". Proceeds to show a thin bar of carbon fiber. Right.
Does the name plaque on the engine come with the phone# of the engine builder?
Let me get this right. It is 2021, the car is called a 2023 model however it is to go on sale in the summer of 2022. Am I the only that think something is off here and that it is likely some marketing BS which is at fault.
Your shirt should say Thhhhhhhhhhhis..., not This.
“Like some plebeian” 😂😂👍🏽
Z06 = WFO
Isn't there a thing where DuPage Chevy extra Chevy to come in and help build the engine and then you can sign the plaque
God damn it’s ugly
This car goes a lot faster than 186 mph. The base model did that. He wasn’t listening when Tadge (chief engineer) spoke.
Chevrolet Supercar Blondie drive it Doug! Are you jealous?
Doug's arms get .25 inches longer every time he says "this".
Very cool. I wish Zora could have seen the birth of a mid-engine Vette. But, honestly, I think I will forever like the front engine cars better. I have fallen in love with the C7. Oddly I like all odd numbered generations of vettes.
But Doug. Tell me. Is this car even WIDER?
I hope you review my favorite car (Lexus lx600)
Wow like somebody cares
Cars and Bids is just Grand Tourismo 4 Roster and up change my mind
Why is it a "2023" released in 2021 when its announced for 2022?
still no manual option? i know they said it wouldnt fit when the base model c8 came out, but I figured maybe they would have tried again or harder at least for the z06
I'm not familiar with carbon wheels, but as someone who's been thru many aftermarket rims, I hope these won't bend or crack the sec those 25series low pros kiss their 1st pothole
6:14 *HOLY ORANGE PEEL BATMAN*
this is too much of a car, can't imagine the ZR1 version of this. corvette c8 is not just a  muscular supercar killer, IT IS a muscular supercar now.
Dude in my country its still 2021. In which country 2023 already came??
I think this is the same car TJ Hunt recorded
If you have to say it's a big deal... It's not.
Welcome to Gboard clipboard, any text you copy will be saved here.Congratulations to everyone who comes in every single seconds
This car is beautiful 🔥
But it's 2021
I need to see Randy Pobst put some lap times down in one of these. 😁
@Ruben Rome 7, just wait for the Gran Sport version. Same body with a twin Turbo V6
Boner on wheels. I wish he would have stopped saying the dreaded "Chevy" word. I doubt Chevy has much to do at all with the manufacturing of the Corvette. Otherwise the right rear tail light would never work and the rest of it would fall apart.
I had appointments twice to test drive a Corvette and each time they found a reason not to let me drive it.  The staff (corporate HQ ignored me) was smug and I have sworn to never buy one of these.  Chrysler finally has a car that isn't junk and so they opt for arrogance.
Wroom Wroom
When you want a Ferrari - but it has to be American made...
YEEESSSSSSSS.....I've been waiting on this one...
"this huge carbon fiber wing is absolutely huge."  That's the sort of detailed description I crave. Jeexus, Doug.
Out here reviewing cars 2 years into the future
If that engine start knocking in the first week we kno who getting fired because they name on the engine 😂
No drive, no Doug score for you.  I suppose that we'll get a full review soon enough. :D
those seatbelts are going to be a bitch to clean lol
Why don’t they add a v10 or v12 to the corvette like viper did keep the camaros as v8’s
Aye Doug, is the 2019 Chevy Corvette ZR1 still the ultimate Corvette or this new ZO6??
This is the greatest car Chevy has ever produced.
If you didn't think the C8 was a supercar before, now you can't with the 670hp
If you get rid of your fat wife you can afford it
C6 Z06 frontend has entered the chat….
Doug the type of guy to review a 2023 car in 2021
I really don’t like the front end. I think that the total appearance package is great but there’s some thing about the tip of the nose that just looks bulbous and frumpy compared to the standard model
The long bonnet on a corvette is so iconic tho.
Most powerful V8 in a production car too that’s unreal
https://youtu.be/GHIMASbscXA
Wake up babe new Doug just dropped
Wow; Petersen has nice lighting, don't they?
Considering this is one of those "old school ICE vehicles" ;) ....its about as sick as it gets. As for this color... Hmmm. I hate yellow... but add just a hint of green (chartreuse) and it becomes one of my favorite colors. Id really need to see it in person. Anyway, at least add a few electric motors, and a battery pack that can give it a 350 hp electric boost... for a 1000+ hp total, and it would be much cooler. Honestly, Id rather just see this car all electric, with about 1400 hp ;) But again, for an ICE vehicle, its pretty sick as it is.
So Hot!!!  Regretting not being on a list for MSRP at a large Chevy dealer.
Finally!  The super car sound to match the supercar styling!  Well done Chevy!
After seeing the meme all I see is the marlin on the side of the car lol
I don't think giving a pre production "vehicle" a Doug Score is worthy
Hopefully it's got better fit and finish I've been working on these now for over a year and they are absolute trash to work on
How they made uglier then the regular c8
But Doug is it a supercar?? You said the C7 Z06 wasn't a supercar, was hoping you would address that question in the C8 Z06 review.
What a victory for GM. This car looks and sounds fantastic! And 670 horsepower without forced induction is absolutely insane. Like, “more than a V10 Lamborghini” insane. Absolutely nuts. There’s a spot for one in my dream garage for sure.
i'd rather have a jeep
Calling a car model 2023 in 2021 is a simple scam 💩👎🏼
Rivals? Really, they would not let you say they improved on something Ford did first?
that shirt says it all. 00:00 1:42
That sound enough is worth it
Can’t forget the $30k+ dealer markup
All the buttons are hilarious
Smokes like all Chevies hahahah I love unburned gasoline
Slapped my forehead looking at the horrible orange peel of that paint finish……having been in paint process optimization for 25 years….and having had GM ignore my super cost effective paint process improvements for about that long..  C8 deserves a “Supercar” paint finish!
Tesla plaid says hold my beer
So... Will you finally declare this an exotic car?
Holy crapola. 8O  GM has spent most of the last 2 decades proving it can build world-class rides, particularly  with the Cadillac brand. But even those pale in comparison to the total package exotic challenger that is the C8 Z06. I never thought I'd see GM make something like this with that kind of engine. It even sounds like an exotic in how the engine starts, not just the engine hum. You know the Ford 5.2 vs Chevy 5.5 FPC V8 battles are coming. Who's gonna swap a 5.2 into a Ford GT, throw some tech at it to get some output parity, and race them? All that said, this yellow one is not the one I'd buy. I'd get the red-sex nail polish one with the bright wheels. Looks WAY classier and makes the proportions work so much better.
This is like Ferrari but much much cheaper.
Doug, are you sure the Z06 models didn't have updated front ends? The C6Z had a larger mouth opening and a hood scoop (small but noticeable side by side). The C7Z had a different grille, so I'd agree there.
Can you imagine how many sets of the carbon wheels are gonna get stolen
Supra is the answer
Still a shitter Chevy
Awesome performance,  sounds great BUT those side intake vents are hideous
Remember when Corvettes were generally affordable..?   Still a colossal engineering achievement.
Glad they redesigned the vents on the door - looks much better.
Was hoping they’d have the clear/smoked tail lights like last gen
Corvette is the American version of the Lamborghini Aventador but with a much interesting price 🥇  How not to love it
6:30 -- If Chevy wanted to avoid the "wing clearance" problem, they could have just mounted the wing on the tailgate lid itself.  (This would have had the bonus of not being in your way if you were standing behind the car, trying to get something in the rear trunk.)  I assume there was some structural reason for putting it on a fixed part of the car.
I've stopped watching this guy months ago.  Can't determine if his fake body movements and arm waving are more pronounced than they were before.
Take a drink everytime he says wider.
The 67 stingray was a way better design.  It was beautiful and unique.  This looks like every other Ferrari wannabe.
Game changer a Ferrari feel and daily driven without the maintenance headaches compared to it's rival !
ohhh myyyyyyy
Just imagine how insane the ZR1 will be
Another recycle car
Seat belts should match the color of the brake calipers.
Anyone else getting McLaren vibes from the door slots
The color combo is stunning not gonna lie.
The lighting makes it look like two different paint jobs.
Amazing car, it's a future of a fantastic speed car. I love it
I love Chevy but pushing Z07 to make even more money is getting old.  I understand business but that way of doing business is why GM is so far behind Tesla.  GM will soon rush out all of the gas powered technology they have so they can make something off all that technology they’ve been hold.  Especially now that no more gas cars will be produced in the near future.  GM could’ve stayed innovative but chose to be overly greedy. Now they will suffer.  Gm is my favorite company but it’s time to move on to the future.
Finally, a good looking super car
Chevy made Ferrari>>>>>hahahah
Aston martin Valkyrie v12 naturally aspirated
race
20:10 bruh lol
Damn, that car comes out the year I graduate, and I think the car is unbelievable the way I hear about it!
Ok but why is it a 2023? It’s 2021. Ua anyone else confused
If I had to guess price I'm gonna say somewhere in the $150-175k range which would still be a bargain imo
Cant get over Dougs pronunciation of alcantara  "Al CAN TERA", or am I the only one who doesnt emphasize the CAN?
6:36 "The wing has a very small tolerance".... Doug, it clears the wing by like an inch.  That's not a small tolerance.  That's blind monkey tolerance.
I like the trick where he’s standing in the same spot and wearing the same stuff during the transition from plug to content.
Whatever you do wave your hands more
Sounds similar to my 360
One Question can it beat a Tesla on a highway?
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
now there making cars two years before oh my god
Does the Z07 come with the aero package as standard?  😜
Still, the design is just a bad copy of Italian supercars. They tried too much to make it look good but failed, imo.
How many times did Doug say “wider” 😂
Wake me up when the Zora ZR1 comes out fantastic video as always however!
"THHHiSSS is the …" That opening is so annoying
its km/h not kph
Idk how I feel about that startup sound
I may be in the minority here but I think it's ugly. The C6, C7 ZO6 were more subtle. This looks something you'd mod on Need For Speed of or Gran Turismo. I prefer the regular C8. Although the round tips in the middle of the car do look vastly better.
Buy red standard C8 for 'Is that a Ferrari?' Buy yellow Z06 for 'Is that a Lamborghini?'
but... is it track orientated? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe mention that a few more times to clarify it for us. ;-)
11:25 no The most power naturally aspirated is in “La Ferrari1500hp” you may say: *this is hybrid car* well still Without hybrid power it will make 800hp w/ naturally aspirated Engine
Honestly all of your exhaust note clips suck ass. U revd the engine to 3k. Not near high enough to hear anything. Most disappointing part of this channel.
Looks like a wasp
670 hp is not enough. Someone will try to stuff a supercharger back there.
Badass! I'm thinking it will be around 170,000 MSRP with 50,000 ADM!
It looks like a mini henessy venom f5
All of those aero parts make it look over-styled, almost like a 5 year designed it.
i live in the Northwest U.S.  can anyone tell me who would be best dealer to insure an order of this bad machine?  Awesome job Doug, the best for sure.
https://youtu.be/tZAw1fd4phU
Easily the best color for this beast
Well, now we waiting for the zr1
Initially the best thing about it are the new air intakes especially on the sides...  way better than the original C8, they look cheap and nasty on the C8 whereas here they're way better sculpted.
Beautiful car!!! That’s all gotta say.
Track, track, track. Right. 99.7 percent of these will never see a track. The put corvette on the wheels because if they didn’t you wouldn’t know what you were looking at because they don’t look at all like corvettes anymore.
Goddddd....this guy is so annoying and a total dork lol
Blipping the throttle to 2k rpm isn’t showing anyone the exhaust sounds. Please start actually revving these cars
They had a team spend two years developing the exhaust for 75% of the owners to rip it out and put in straight pipes
/pləˈbēən/
Both the C6 and C7 Z06 had different front ends.  Although the c7 was certainly less noticeable.
Cars and bibs :) Great Name :))) All jokes aside is great that someone thought of a car sales website for moms!
Damn it - no driving in this vid lol hopefully soon enough you can drive it:)
The torque number leaves much to desire
My god this looks so much better the the regular car. The design finally makes sense....the regular car looks a mess
Love it
The wider rear end is designed to accommodate the wider tires for a wider contact print and wider acceleration much whiter than the previous less wide C8 which is 3 inches less wide than the wider zo6
C6 and C7 both changed the front and rear ends of the Z06 vs base model 🤷‍♂️
im still will buy a last gen viper
Meh... still looks like a cheap Ferrari and it wont hold any value in the long run. No thanks.
Wow we aren’t even in 2022 and there is already 2023
Someone was ripping that car! those tires tell a story
Yawn
The least they could have done was opted for a different reveal color.
It’s like Pikachu’s Dad shows up “No you’re not catching them all”
So lame just GAY
"a flat plane crank V8 always sounds good" - *Amg GT Black Series has left the chat*
lol @ the GT40 shirt on a Corvette review
We will be doing a lot of c8 content! See you soon.
C5 Z06: Daddy got a new suit  C6 Z06: Daddy got a new heart  C8 Z06: Daddy got a new body, cybernetic enhancements, and an attitude
They should have gotten the orange peel out of the paint for the initial release vehicle
Im disappointed that Doug did not mention its DOHC Flatplane engine unlike the every single corvette (except C4 ZR1). Corvette was famous for having the fastest Pushrod engines on Earth.
Sounds like a 458
👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👏
My gosh dealerships are going to mark this up to $150k🤦🏾‍♂️
My opinion, this car would be absolutely perfect *IF*  1. Kept the circle tail lights 2. Had a manual option
Why he moves his head so much when he talks???😂😂😂
I still liked the 2001 version
My ex had a wider rear end.  It was alright...
I am the only one who is still in 2021 ?
Finally the stance is perfect, bigger size and cool looking wheels as well (press release pics).
looks too much like a lambo. FAR too much. in no way does it look "american" it looks far to italian and edgy. shame
"No previous z06 model has had a different looking front end compared to the regular Corvette." Wrong, the c6 zo6 had a different front bumper than the base model c6.
I really don't like how the regular c8 looks, but I can't deny, this is an improvement.. still not my favorite corvette but not the worst either
There is no any chance to recognise this as a Corvette. It's more like a mixture of some unnamed japanese sports car from some car game and a teenager sport shoes
Zo7 should have came with center lock wheels
Engine out service intervals? Anyone knows?
I still don’t understand why Americans are so obsessed with labelling year models of cars so far ahead. It’s available soon and it’s 2021. Why is it the 2023? It’s not even 2022 yet!
5:20 *what cursed part of me thought these tyres were for a rover 25 or mg zr*
I am wondering what will happen when people will put a turbo on this thing... DAMN!!!
you left out the most important part of the engine, the reason why it makes so much power is because it reves so high due to its incredible bore stroke ratio thats closer to an formula 1 car than to a normal production car
Forget the looks honestly, that engine (and performance in general) is what you're really paying for!
This how you know Doug is the Goat he already have a Tour of the new Z06  🤯🐐🐐
Why buy a car that goes 200 mph and will draw the attention of every traffic cop within eyesight wnen the speed limit on most highways is 70 mph or lower. I stopped driving flashy cars many years ago and now drive a nondescript gray SUV. I still go at the same speeds as before but have not gotten a single citation. It's like my SUV is invisible.
It's ugly imo but I imagine it's a fun car to drive
I feel like it's hella ugly but the performance will definitely be crazy.
Yup... it's awesome💕💕😘😘😘😘🥰🥰🤘
Meh
'Unfortunately I can't driv-' *click*
The wheels look like newer Camaro SS wheels
Yeah, but unlike Porsche, they still don’t offer a manual transmission. What’s the point of all the fancy quarks without that major feature?
Love the tshirt hahaha!
My favourite Doug's punch line: "I kind of like to see those little easter eggs there for the FEW people who will probably notice (them, this and that)".. while speaks about most obviously things on car's body or interior ))
Too bad you can't drive this one 😂
2023? This video is from the future
牛逼
I would still watch even if you breathe and do not talk for a few seconds or two.
"A fat man from Kentucky!"
1:35 that clear coat is horrible
This is gonna be the new hellcat
Our guy Doug now even time travelling
Yesssss review the gt black series soon !!!!
0-60 in basically 2 seconds in a car that is not even the most expensive of it's class???? Good enough for me... F U C K YOU TESLA
OMG WHO CARES ABOUT YOUR "TOUR"?!?!? We already know the C8. The performance and driving experience is the only discernable difference. And you didn't drive it. Here's a comment for your YouTube algorithm boost anyway bc we still luv ya.
It's like the engineers from Chevy flew to Italy and broke into Ferrari.
Dam what is the ZR1 going to be 😶
But before I get started…………Blah Blah Blah
Oh, look... Another american hype train that wont live up to its claims. Like the previous Corvette. And the one before that.
WOW they really have tried hard to make sense of that weird plastic side feature.
I want to like this car but there is just something about it that looks off too me. I think it's the fact that it just doesn't remind me of a Corvette, at all! There are just soooo many different angles on this car. I could care less about how much power it has, hell you can power up a Honda Civic, that's just a matter of money.
It's so cool to me that they finally are giving a ton of interior options and just customizable things in general but man I can already here the "my Corvette is best Corvette" and "it's a one of one" boomers
Nobody in the comments can afford one lmao
man and i call 2010 cars new.... time goes so fast
I’m not sure I’m impressed by the Z06.  I’m reluctant, at best.
Doug, did you wear the Ford GT shirt for the review of the z06(7) for a reason? :). We all know your love for that car!
Glad to see they finally cleaned up those shitty side vents
It's beautiful
what a weapon. I want one. well done Doug.
In reality when they try to make cheap copies of a supercar the failure is almost certain but in this case in my opinion they did a great job and if you think of  all the technology, carbon fiber etc etc that contains the price it is also reasonable. I am sure that if the logo was Ferrari, porsche, mclaren etc etc it would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. hand up to the engineer and designer bravo
So you are telling me I can get the aero pack or zo7 package separately?
The Corvettiest Corvette to have ever Corvetted.
This is one of the most beautiful cars ever to come out of America.
How do u get to review a 2023 model.
Wooohooo
15:00 doug is the kind of guy who thinks plebians drive the regular C8
which is the real color, the deep yellow or pale yellow o-o
Why is the top speed so low though? ferrari 458 does 210mph
The fact that it doesn’t even break 200mph is a huge disappointment
T
When is the EV version coming out? 🤔
Looks like a Ferrari, sounds like a Ferrari. And i am fine with that!
aight now throw a 2.4l supercharger on top of that
Brian o’conner + Paul Walker = Brian Walker
Despite the reasonable MSRP, there is a huge markup (even with regular C8's). At the higher marked up price, its better to just get a Porsche Taycan. The Taycan is faster, seats 4 and can carry my family and more.
Freaking awesome that they invited him on launch day. I've been watching him for years. Amazing car, and great review.
What is the MSRP?
cant wait for zr1
All I see is the long lug nuts sticking out.
did I miss something or which year is it again?
Please don a 986 boxster s review
ahhh that "quirks and features" is so satisfying
Doug please do a horn an sound check on every yes literally every car from now on.
Gurney Flap
Why this beautiful color in this video is nasty asf???
I can't be the only one who prefers not to watch the reviews where Doug can't drive the car
Ford gt vs c8 z06
Z06 looks much better that the standard C8 for sure it finally looks as it should
https://youtu.be/rbhXqFKikzk
186 mph max speed , fer how much 🥴🙄! The old C6 Z06 goes 198mph stock with 505hp fer bout $30-40k!  Oh an it's stick shift 😁🤷🤦 Lol 😌
When will you be  able to drive this car
These new Vettes give me some NSX vibes 🤷‍♂️. Feel like this should've been the new NSX and vice versa.
When are Americans going to figure out how to pronounce "chassis"?  Ironically, you manage to pronounce "Chevy" as Shevy.
I just love that T-shirt
4:54 Did anyone else notice the loose bolt on the bottom?
I've been waiting for the 2023 Z06 to come out, and I'm to excited it came out!! It looks amazing and stunning in that shade of yellow
Nice shirt 😂 .Oh sorry THIS is a nice shirt
"...is this massive, rear wing. This huge carbon-fiber wing is absolutely huge... You have this massive carbon-fiber rear wing and it really is huge... This giant wing in the back..."  This is the reason why I watch Doug's videos on x1.75, and it's just one example of his repetitiveness. Not to mention being "mr. obvious" and describing something that we can clearly see. If he would make an effort to write his script and read it during the filming (like many youtubers do) I'm sure most of his videos would end up being half as long.
That’s some serious razor blade … Watch out pedestrians … 😅
What a beauty, time to win the lotto ! xD   Thank you Doug for the review, been following you for some time, love all your car reviews, well deserved invite from Chevy to review the new Z06 !
Can't wait to see the Doug face when he finally gets to mash the peddle down. Chevy truly brought the Heat! Love it!
Soft limiter?
"gone are the days with big ole V8 with low red line"  the current generation C8 has a redline of 6500
It’s not even 2022
Doug the kind of guy to get lost in tent city in LA and say to everyone “BE SURE TO CHECK OUT CARS AND BIDS!!!”
I’ve been waiting for this since GM announced that the C8 would be mid engine.
Doug, if you want me to work for you I am in!!!  You must be enjoying a lot!!! Share the happiness 😅😅😅 Flirting with cars!!!
Love the color .. dare I say better color than BMW  sao paulo yellow
Dollars to torque numbers are legendary, the v10 viper can't even compete.
I like how the front already looks like it crashed so you don't have to worry about it.
Excellent and Outstanding!!!
Doug u gotta do ur homework betta, the c7 Zr1 has the same front end, and more dwn force... Just thought u should know, oh yea uh top speed of 215mph, of course with, and against the wind...
Why do the rear tires look nearly bald? But the side walks look New?
How do you know Doug is excited? Excessive arm movement.
Please upgrade your camera Doug, switching from iPhone to that kinda crappy camerais jarring and distracting
It looks like they took a 2002 Camaro and put a F&F Civic body kit and wing on it. This looks and sounds so outdated next to electric vehicles. You can spend all that money and still get out quartered by a Tesla Model 3 or a Rivian pickup truck.
With all those special features, that Vette will still get dusted by a Dodge Demon 😈
"This huge carbon fiber wing is absolutely huge"
Ferrari Z06 🤣🤣🤣🤣 flatplane crank
Already off to a misleading start....The C7 Z06  makes 650hp & 650 ft lbs of torque out of it's 6.2L supercharged engine...The C8 Z06 5.5L naturally aspirated higher revving rpm engine makes 670hp (only 20 more hp) but only 460ft lbs of torque (190 less torque)  The C8 Z06 should in theory be an overall better improved car but some sacrifices had to be made along the way (like 190ft lb torque loss)....It's an awesome car but many have this misconception that just because it's now rear/mid engine and looks different that it's somehow light years ahead of the 2019 C7 that actually has it's gear box located in the rear & engine in front giving it good even weight distribution. The rear engine on the C8 adds a bit more weight to the rear tires for a little more grip 40f/60r VS 50f/50r giving it a better launch but loses some cornering capabilities. Everything is a compromise, in order to get a gain here, you have to lose a little over here.
The corvettes now don't even look like a real corvette.    Pretty sad...
This would be my dream spec.
0-60 in 2.5 sec is hypercar category
it's ugly as hell
Me: "oh boy cant wait to hear that high reving engine and exhaust note" Soft limiter: "No!"
Oh and no more torque than a regular c8? WTF is the point then? Anyone who knows cars knows that your acceleration comes from your torque as well as power ratio. That is a huge disappointment.
This particular model has the equipped z07 package which makes the C8z06 look like a  f-cking WASP… beauty is in the eye of the beholder…  It sounds good… just like a Ferrari…
really like the look of this
New drinking game...... take a shot everything Doug says "Z07" or "Z06" SERIOUSLY DOUG.......we get it. Love your videos but you gotta stop repeating yourself man.
Nice review buddy!! :)
Why don't we get these in South Africa?
CAN YOU REVIEW A FERRARI MONZA
Can't you be more redundant? Oh my god.
sounds like a car dealership presentation: "you can get this package or this and this one as well"
James Hetfield on the background @17:41 ;)
Fact: carbon fiber pattern is awful
That all white setting is terrible
no. NO. you cannot make a 2023 model in 2021.... you cannot. i refuse this car until they get it right....
Front nice, side so so, back really ugly. Waiting for that redesign.
I wonder how it would sound if exhaust pipes would be arranged like Audi logo ;)
That team corvette logo on the back window refers to team corvette the GTLM race team
Best American ride I've ever seen. When can I pick up mine?
we not even in 2022 yet💀
"Z Zero Six", that's a zero not an O
trailer Park Ferrari
Nope.  Sorry but it's ugly to me.
Civic type r has 3 exhaust tips Doug and haters: ew. Wtf honda. Chevy 4 exhaust tips.  Doug and fanboys: wow. That looks awesome. 🤦‍♂️
I've seen one of these on the streets. I thought it was the previous stingray model, but it was this model. Thought they were already out.
I wish the carbon ceramics were optional. I want the Carbon fiber wheels but not the breaks, just had to pay 1500 for pads for my ZR1 and its annoying. Best case is just to sell the breaks right when you buy it.
I love that color, though it does look like an overcooked egg yolk.
I want to see Doug in a C8 convertible, you should definitely add one to the collection 🤌🏼
This is setting people up for a huge fall. Current new c8 base models like the Stingray are going for over 100k at dealers. This z06 has got to end up being close to 150k. Can you just imagine what will happen to that value when/if global supply chains are fixed? Major depreciation...
5:56 "this huge carbon fibre wing is absolutely huge" Creative choice of words
Yeah but that 911 on the ad though
The C6 and C7 Z06 both had different front ends even if the differences were subtle 🤷‍♂️
ok is it just me or did that look like black smoke coming out of the tail pipe?
Nice video… but he moves so much I felt like my anxiety had 900hp
345 rear tire  is a $500 tire..  keep that in mind
The only way a wider rear is wanted.
Most noticeable change with the rear end to me is the shrinking of the giant ugly black rectangles on each side.  Man I hated those....
If MotorTrend is getting smarter, they'll be crying right now when they see this.  (And yes, I saw they posted and ain't gonna bother clicking their video).
Hey Doug I think you need to take a few more lines of coke before filming, not enough fidgeting bb
This looks sooo much better than the c8
still a Zr1 and the Zora coming, they're going to be insane
The Z07 package looks nasty. Unless you really intend to track this car, don’t get it. The wing is ugly, the front end canard vanes look stupid. The Z06 is perfect without this aero kit.
Nicer front end, better wheels, still looks like shit lol
Those tires are $850 a piece
Dealership's will mark this up to $130-$150K sadly.
Overdesigned! Pumped Prius.
Down a drink every time he says "wider". Could be dead in 5 minutes.
Proud to be Apart of Team Corvette!
Oh, they put a soft-limiter on it. That's what makes it sound unique, gotcha.
a way faster car! the regular one does 0-60 in 3 sec! the enhanced one does it in 2.5 ! what a difference!!!!😂😂😂😂
WTF? How could you fail to mention what is by far the most radical aspect of the C8 Zo6 and a massive departure for the Corvette in general, which is that the motor is a 32V DOHC??!
Maybe idk what I’m talking about but those tires already look bald
This supposed to be a Corvette,right? Congrats,you fucked up everything!
https://youtu.be/ATiYoo3WEjI
The front ends change on the c6 zo6. It’s wider shape and has a intake on the top of the bumper and the c7 zo6 just has a different grill and some come with more aero. Just a little fact check around 2:45ish
flat plane v8, so even if the convertible handled like a lemon, it's the choice you HAVE to make because flat plane v8
Watch they gone make a Corvette SUV the same way Mustang; Ferrari; Lamborghini have. it would only make sense a corvette suv would be badass
Plz drive this when the production version comes out
I could afford a C8 but not a C8 Z06 and I would want it solely for the exhaust note:
Just waiting now for the  epic fails videos, when some loser leaves a car meet and puts it into ditch 😁😁
Nice car, but this video sounds more like a sale promo video for Chevy packages rather than a car intro for Doug's regular audience.
finally RH drive version as per CEO of Chevy said on the official u tube channel about the new 2023 C8 ZO6 ? Also a little to late Doug?
take a sip every time he says Z06
Ehhh I liked the C7 z06 better. This looks... Busy. However, is Doug wearing only one shirt!!?
I'm here just to buy the shirt.
Not to be a downer. But I'm personally not in to the new corvette design. I think corvettes were iconic because of it's own unique style as a powerful american muscle car. 1st it began "borrowing" certain designs from Ferrari. Now seemingly going totally "euro". I mean it's "nice" for what it is. But I'm just curious as to where's Chevy Corvette's "originality". Chevy even bought Ford F-150's design for the Silverado around 1999-2000. I guess I'm just a die hard old school Chevy fan.
I'm glad to see Chevy update there engine to a 32V/flat plane crank & carbon fiber wheels like a 2015 Shelby GT350R, just 8 years late to the dance. Next will Chevy copy a 1400HP Mustang Mach E. LOL
Man O man, Doug is hyped by getting this exclusive.  He sounds like a kid in a candy store.  What a car.
That pretty yellow car.
I just watch a video of a 38 year old guy crash this car in Florida.
I think ppl click dislike just bc their jealousy, bc this is nasty and a good review and
2023?
That yellow looks awful in such a white room....
My inner boy: "finally, a mid engine corvette and its so affordable"  😃  My brain: "we're broke, stfu" 😒
GM: What should we do for our next Corvette folks?  VP 1: let's make it look like a McLaren! VP 2: throw in a few dashes of Ferrari in the interior. VP: And write Corvette on the wheels so no one will mistake it for another car.  GM CEO: So we're just gonna make supercar soup? Sounds good to me!
Problem with calling this car important is that NOONE will be able to buy one. With the supply shortage and the chip shortage they'll be able to make like a dozen of them and then only the hyper rich will be able to afford the mark up.
Damn it’s not even 2022
Can't decide if I like the side boomerangs or not.
It just... it doesn't LOOK like a Corvette to me
Take a shot anytime Doug says; wider, Z07, or Aero
It looks like a MANTIS! 🔥
c6 had a ram air hood vs. base model car fyi
And legacy auto wonders why theyre dying
12:08 look at his reflection on the wing haha
People with Electric corvettes in 2025 be like 💪😎😅
Does anyone know the price range around the 2023 Chevy Corvette C8 Z06?
Very nice looking, performance second to um, uh....every Tesla Plaid S. Everything has changed. Chevy needs to rethink their performance division. Shit, every model needs to go another direction
Doug should upgrade the video title from Z06 to Z07 lol
This is epic 😍💥
Do the carbon fiber wheels save 40 lbs. per wheel OR 40 lbs. for all four wheels combined? If it's the later it would be a bit disappointing.
Doug you gotta figure out some color tuning here
This is definitely disappointing for Corvette fans especially Corvette Z06 fans, because if you ain’t a track driver or a good track driver whats the point of having this car ? At least the C7 ZO6 was more of a street car 650HP 650 torque an came with a manual transmission an what’s the difference between this an a base C8? I’m confused you get a carbon fiber steering wheel 170 more horsepower in a louder exhaust 🤷🏼‍♂️ for an extra 100K more then the base C8 ? Makes no sense unless you’re professional driver that’s the only way you can really probably tell the difference like regular even if you’re a regular track driver you ain’t gonna get the times pro drivers get 🤷🏼‍♂️ so people are saying if it does under seven minutes and the Nurburgring that’s crazy, like bro your a regular driver your not gonna get those numbers, you’re not gonna be able to push the car that limit 🤷🏼‍♂️ what am basically saying is that it’s too track focused. Look the C7 base had 460 horsepower and 455 torque the C7Z had 650 horsepower 650 torque it was way nicer exterior an it came with a manual transmission an it was louder. Now what’s the difference? between the Base C8 and the C8Z ? I’m thinking Chevrolet made the base C8 so good that it really makes no sense to get the C8Z Unless you’re a track driver, what about us street guys? Us roll racers, 18:25 see 🤷🏼‍♂️
9:20 that viewing angle of the front end(from the top of the bumper to back sides of the headlights) has a slight resemblance to the C6. I was looking at it thinking it was an oddly familiar Corvette angle and realized what it looks like. Now, it’s not an obvious or super apparent appearance, but to me, it exists
4 ads in 8 min…
This... is an annoying clown man-child.
This huge carbon fiber wing is huge
If this is the z06, the zr1 will be insane
Those uneven gaps between exhaust pipes tho.
I cant wait to see these carbon wheels on a older car with a vette engine swap..
All I can think of every time I look at this car is electric sedans are faster.
GM finally got the interior right. Beautiful machine both performance and looks wise.
The driver-focus should be a feature on all sport cars.  The only car I can recall doing this constantly was the defunct Eclipse.
Corvette is iconic for being a FRONT ENGINE muscle car and now they ruined it C8sly.
Take a drink every time he says package or Z06. kind of felt like a commercial for z06 package instead of the car
corvette corvette hop ina muhfuckin jet like dat
Oh it costs how much?  Yeah no one cares.  Thanks everyone who voted biden, us normal people really appriciate not being able to afford life anymore.  A supercar in 2021, how tonedeaf.
Did Doug really just say that this is the FIRST Z06  to feature a different front end than standard Corvettes?  Ummm both C6 and C7 featured different front end.  The C7 was primarily a styling difference but the C6 Z06 featured a deeper, lower front bumper with a larger cooling area.  I'm very surprised at this mis-info
Your 20 minute videos feel like 5 minutes ... maybe 6 😂
Its going to be a $100k markup on top of the msrp for sure.
My favorite upgraded design feature are the face lifted side air vents. The first gen C8 vents looked like melting boomerangs. The new vents look properly designed. Quite nice.
So a 170 more horsepower, louder exhaust, an a carbon fiber steering wheel, for an extra 100K Lmaooooo 😂 make no sense the base C8 is just as good for a 100K cheaper 🤷🏼‍♂️ people out there are really gonna be spending a 100K to go around a track 5 seconds faster an quarter mile time an extra 0.5 seconds lmao
<]I like your presentation!!  Clear n straight forward!!the price pump is amazing for very early investors or those who just got in for the first time otherwise it's just bouncing back to normal price for the rest of us which is good, btc truly is a class of its own, it has no competitors . All the other alts are competing with each other, they are more centralized, and the majority of them are not completed projects. I can't believe it when i hear people selling their btc for alts lol, that why I trade with the best analysts since the last bear which i attain maximum success.I am able to make $120,000 in btc this August from implementing trades with tips and info from Daniel Wright a well renowned trader. you can reach out to him to stack up more in this period on TE LE GRAM[Danielwrightfx] on implementing trade.
Looks like Ferrari, Sounds like Ferrari, smells like a Ferrari. This are no more a Real Corvette.
I think KIT would b jealous.
That must literally be the most frustrating thing as a car reviewer. Here is the car, you can look, you can touch, but you cannot drive it. It's like going to a new restaurant before it opens to the public as a food reviewer and they cook you the most amazing looking meal, but tell you that you can't eat it until the restaurant opens in a few months.
It's beautiful. I love that color.
Doug the type of guy to get onto trending for all of YouTube
20 inch in the front and 21 in the back??? Shouldn't be the other way around?
First corvette with a proper super car engine. Expect the fully loaded car to top 150k
My gf said.. it’s looks like if bumblebee lost weight and got shredded at the same time
So awesome, maybe I'll get to drove one in another life time lol. I swear I'm not trying to be a contrarian but I wasn't super impressed with the exhaust note? It's pretty chunky for sure but I didn't find it particularly special.
Working at a Chevy dealer when you are these all day they  get old
Is that a plastic intake manifold !?? 👀👀 ohh boy
Spoiler alert: he doesn’t drive the car
I'd love its Z06 engine in my 2002 Camaro SS !!! Will it fit? I find the Z06 styling loud for my taste.  If I was given one I'd drive it like the Devil himself.
looks like a fucking decepticon holy sht best looking car ive seen this year ga dam its sexy
I wonder when the 2030 model will b out
Sooooo with 170 more horsepower you only get a half second faster? 😑😑👎🏼👎🏼
Has this been on the Nürburgring yet?
Ehhhh, not bad, 61/100 💪🏿
Maybe I'll be able to afford the Hot Wheels version
I’m here for the quirks and features
God, that wing is awful
Thank you to GM for giving us this. In all likelihood, this  is the last great gasp of the high powered exotic flat plane V8s. Ferrari stopped making them and is going electric. Lamborghini has stopped. ICE is almost done. If you've ever wanted an exotic racecar engine that revs to the stratosphere screaming and burbling, this is probably your last chance.
How is it a 2023? They’re that far ahead now
If this is just the Z06 then the ZR1 will be an absolute monster!
Wow this was the longest ad i have ever seen
Let me show you the new z06, which has the aero package from the z07, which changes the front and rear end looks and also has the carbon fibre wheels from the z07, but yeah this is the z06 and not a z06,5 😆
It looks like an old Lamborghini
Only Doug reviews a 2023 model in 2021 . 😎
Chevy says, Chevy says..is all I heard.  Didn't Chevy also say that they were more reliable than Honda and Toyota?  Sick ass Vette though, that's for sure.
And you couldn’t drive it 👎🏽 might as well go to the strip club cause you know you ain’t clapping good video tho 👍🏽
It's kinda ugly
Is this the last gasoline powered corvette  Before it goes electric???
The low point of this car is the fact that it’s a Corvette
That’s so weird sometime I don’t get how things happen it’s 2017 and you see a guy reviewing a car that say bmw 2028 if it’s already there it can not take more than a year to make it
#6 on trending reviewing the ZO6
It has a spin off toyota iforce engine
The front end looks so good, and shapes the car way better than the standard
So you're telling me it's wider
Let’s see, corvette used a koenigsegg style spoiler, Lamborghini style exhaust, viper front canards and trying to brand like Porsche. I can’t stand corvette. Oh and a camera in the rear view. I think they have been doing this in the mini vans for sometime! Then you have annoying Doug!🤦🏻‍♂️
Color me impressed!
4:55 The screw is not torqued down. Is this from all the downforce? lol
When daddy Doug doesn't get a ride in it, but Emilia did.. c'mon Doug.
GM certainly has learned a lot from the fact that Doug's C8 video last year is one of his most viewed videos, so this time they let him to film the Z06 so early
Anybody else thought that Mercedes looked like Peter Griffin's penis car from Family Guy?
Wait, what does the Z07 package include again?
I think you could make a drinking game out of this video.  Take a drink each time Doug mentions aero package or each time he mentions that the aero package is included with the ZO7 package.  Also drink each time he mentions ZO7 package.
Vettes were much sexier back in the day. Just looks like a generic supercar nowadays.
DOUG SCORE PREDICTION (Pls notice me Doug! Tell me if I might've come close to its probable future Doug Score 😅) Styling - 8 Handling - 9 Acc - 10 Fun - 9 (bc no stick option) Cool - 8 (currently) Total Weekend: 44/50 ---------------------------------- Features - 7 Comfort - 3 Practicality - 4  Quality - 7 Value - 9 Total Daily: 30/50 ☆Doug score: 74/100☆
maam 2021 is still goin
Only revs it to 1000rpm 😞
Doug: The Z07 is vastly different looking... Me: Yeah, Nah Mate...
Looks way better then the non zo6
The simplistic interviewer immunocytochemically consider because century intringuingly touch between a nosy witch. spotless, nice tent
GM created the C8 to out do Ferrari and the C8 Z06 to out do Lamborghini
The engine bay in this car looks like a decepticons face from a Michael Bay Transformsers film
C8 base 0 to 60 2.8 Zo7 2.6-2.7  For 175hp more than base and at 30k$ more than the c8 don’t know if it’s worth it
Apparently, there's a lot that's distinctive.
God. I can just imagine what numbers and looks the ZR1 will be putting out.
Doug, can you clarify if the aero package comes with the zo7? ;) Always an informative video, thanks!
Can't drive?
It’s awesome but not any faster than the base but atleast power doesn’t die out like the stingray
I had to click. Holy crap that color is terrible.
The aero - does the Z07 upgrade include that?
Nice
2023 Chevy Aventador
Can I order one with manual transmission?
I'm assuming they weren't revving it much because either cold and not good on a new engine, engine hasn't been broken in yet, too new and has a safety limiter on, so you can't hear it's higher rpms.
I'll take two please....
Man, that is the worst exhaust grunt I've ever heard.
It's odd how someone can take a brochure and one camera and have a million viewers 🤣
I’m surprised you didn’t mention the difference in the tailpipe placement. The base C8 has a split duel exhaust vs the Z06 center placement.
Why is it called the Z06 and not the Z08 (8th gen)?
This side profile is way too good than C8 stingray !!
Chevy waited till the end of gas cars to destroy mopar with NA power.
Daddy doug with the merch 🔥🔥
Doug your #6 on trending. You deserve it !
It’s a gorgeous car🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍😍
They had to to do this… Dodge been beating the brakes off them… And still not enough…. But it is a sexy beast!
Will these crack in half if you jack them up wrong?
I like the standard C8 better. This one looks too extreme for my taste. Especially when the rear wing looks so funky.
I refuse to believe that the convertible version is as rigid as the hard top version. The physics make no sense unless the hard top was an afterthought and the car was always designed to be tracked as a convertible.
What an amazing machine. Congratulations to the Chevy team for creating such an awesome machine.
So it still looses in a race to a 4 door sedan. Who wants a slow 2 seater when you can buy a 2 second family 4 door Tesla plaid that is cheaper then this car.
Is it me, or does this just not cut it unless he drives it and does an exaust sound check?
Imagine scraping those carbon fiber rims. Like how would someone even go about repairing them??
Shit zr1 gotta bring scissor doors
The very first thing he says is wrong about the front of corvettes
The torque is why we want to buy a corvette.  460 ft lbs?  That sucks.  I’ll stick with a 992 carrera 4S for this price point.  Edit:  I’ll pcu chip tune the 992 for a couple grand and it’ll actually beat this thing on a track and strip now that I think about it.  The 992 is already a twin turbo
The interior of the c8 is what the latest gen supra should have looked like.   Looks like an updated mk4 supra cockpit.
Chevy sticks their 6.2 in the mid engine bay and suddenly everyone is horny for it. Fords been doing this since the 60s with the GT
Z06 is so uncivilized, as any self-respecting Corvette buyer will always opt for the Z07 .
Still rather have a Ferrari
Yeah - loads of people have got 90 grand for a car.  On what planet?
Corvette doesnt have a place anymore. It used to be a fun American car that was cheap. Now it’s becoming an almost 200k car. Id much rather buy a c5 z06 for 20-30k then put 20k in various upgrades and still have an extra 80-120 grand in my pocket. The c8, and the c8 z06 are cool cars. But i dont like what the corvette name plate has become.
Doug, we cannot see the bottom of the car but you can certainly get the GoPro under it and show us those Ground effect tunnels!!!
just fucking hate that rear end looks like the jokers camaro or some shit
Looks like junk
I can't imagine what the C8 ZR1 will be like
Engines are hand built and signed. Has anyone stopped to think that there are so many immigrants that work in factories and yet none of these signed engines are by an immigrant. The AMGs are always a German name despite all the Muslim immigrants to live there, and THIS engine signed by Brian whatever the fuck when it was probably really built by Carlos Santos. Sounds like a scam
I can’t even begin to imagine the cost to replace one of the carbon fiber wheels if you accidentally curb rash it
If you cant beat a Ferrari, be a Ferrari. Honestly this would be the first American car that I would buy if I had the money.
the voice crack at 12:54 💀
the hexagons have invaded, the power of the raging bull is strong  lol
wow you didnt even drive the car
the hexagons have invaded, the power of the raging bull is strong  lol
Fbo with some E85 the 0-60 times is going to be crazy fast
Calling it a 2022 is a little bit of a stretch, but 2023? Sussy
It's a nice car. The interior carbon fiber is a bit ricey to me. Leather or aluminum would have been better.
How big is this? Doug gets clout for making anyone wait 1 year and 2 months before it can truly get any score.
More like Ryobi package??
What a beautiful machine!
Gorgeous 🇺🇸🔥
Awesome...monster engine . Love the extra lip an skirt on this..that paint job works perfectly with the black decals/wheels...perfect
Cant wait to buy one in 5 years for 1/3 the price and beat the piss out of it
Updated cooling in front....then why do the intakes under the headlights appear so fake?  Or do they only open up when braking?  This car is Silly Putty Yellow...before it gets covered in dirt & embedded with hairs.
The regular c8 doesn't have anywhere near 500hp
This is like blippi for adults.
Yep, you got that right about the looks. I honestly don't need the extra power compared to the Stingray (torque is the same anyway), but I love the look of the Z06, even without all the optional aero. Love the center exhaust, for one thing. Debating whether to convert my C8 convertible order to the Z06. Might depend on pricing...
My personalization touch would be a damn manual transmission 🙄
"Drive that point home." I see what you did there! 😆
I hope quality is as good as Porsche but I highly doubt it but hey Porsche is Porsche right! ? For same price Porsche is choice but this is option
That looks amazing. After seeing the Stingray I wondered if the Z06 could wow me…good job GM!!!
Nice to see the car wearing a hi-vis jacket for safety.
Lamborghini huracan vs C8  Z06
Doug the type of guy to clap when the airplane lands
Apparently someone’s already been roasting them tires there’s already no tread left 🤣
i cant stop saying THIS
I don’t like that giant wing it doesn’t fit the shape of the car, ever since the original C8 debuted…
Doug, you forgot to mention that Chevy had been autographing their special engines for years. During the build process a customer can option the right to build the engine going into their car. The name of the owner is placed on the name plate vice the master mechanic.
Can't wait for that black series review!
Nobody does car reviews like doug A+
no drive test?
Tuning the exhaust just so it can sound cool is stupid. The natural sound of a cool car calibrates the listener's taste as to what sounds pleasing and sets its own standard. It's not like the sound of exhaust is a symphony, it's just the sound of a damned machine.
Don't believe I've heard weight discussed in a review. Around 3700lb.?
A TRUE rival to the Ferraris and Lamborghinis, etc.! 😆👍
2023 model year car that exists in 2021? Lmao what. It's going on sale summer of 2022 right? Seems like they're about six months early if it's a 2023 model.
bruh it's not even 2022.
2:50 I don’t think the changes to the front will improve cooling to the engine when the engine is in the back.
Awesome video! This car is so awesome!
Nice car; nice review; but—yellow? Lemons are yellow…
Worked at a warehouse that made the c8 z06 steering wheels
*Skips to part where Doug gets to drive it-    .. oh..  oh.           Come on, they didn't let you drive the Chevy ?
how come he didn't talk about how water goes into the engine when it rains or wash  i hope they didn't pay him to not mention that
only 2 type of people will buy these.. the 55 year old who's kid just left the house (don't worry they will be back) and the car YouTuber who will own it for a month and get rid of it.
It looks like a Dyson vacuum cleaner.  Who is Doug DeMuro?
Says he can't drive it because it's pre production but those tires say otherwise 👀👀
Magnetic ride control isn’t new ? Wasn’t it on certain C5 corvettes ?
That yellow is a really nice colour
GM stole that spoiler from a Mexican guy’s Civic
Does it turn red under water?
I think I’m developing an allergy to Doug. He’s becoming linked finger nails on a chalk board. But here I am. Giving it another shot while I wait for the next Throttle House.
I like wide rear ends w tires to grip...
That must be the ugliest steering wheel EVER and it's still ugly with all that carbon fiber.
I was looking at the orange rx7 on cars and bids while the bid was live and I was geeking so hard to it
Nice car but a ICE Corvette is a dead man walking product. By the time you pay of the lease the depreciation due to everyone moving to EV's will destroy its resale value. Also I'm betting the Tesla Plaid and Model S 100D will stomp all over it on the drag strip. It is a bit like paying big money for a DVD rental store knowing everyone is moving to on-line streaming.
good jobb
Gorgeous car, gorgeous color.
Doug: "Chevy doesn't take youtubers seriously" Chevy: "Come film the hottest car of the year before we reveal it."
Y’all freakin out for this wait for when that zr-1 comes out.
This car is absolutely stunning. Well done Chevy
It’s amazing how far Doug’s come, getting invited to review a car which has literally just been revealed just shows how popular he’s become and I’m so happy I’ve been here to watch him expand. Love it!
It’s not even 2022 yet?
I’m so tired of seeing dealer price gouging & this car will be even worse. What’s the point of manufacturing an “ affordable “ car if you can’t buy it for the “affordable “ price. I hope everyone remembers all of the greedy price gouging dealers once this supply issue is over.
Doug is trending on you tube.   Congrats!!!
They should have put a plaque on there to commemorate the victims of the Bowling Green massacre.
Nobody talking about Doug’s shirt?
Seventh day commenting until Doug reviews a Volkswagen Beetle.
This will be the one to own folks.. Not the ZR1 not the Zora not the base but this one.  When the world goes full EV we will look back on this spec as a shining example.
thisssseeeeeeee......LOL...LOL....LOL
A beautiful car.  A track star.  An engineering marvel.  But, only available in an automatic, and for that reason, I will never own one new or used at any price.
That rear View camera😂😂😂
Carbon Fibre:  the new Woodgrain.
Before this what shot, TJ hunt failed to realize he walked past doug
The “updated front” looks like my 2012 mazda 3! 😂
And yet a sorta futuristic looking electric sedan like for instance a Tesla Model S plaid which will be cheaper and much faster. Which you can order right now for MSRP.?? Why bother with this anymore?
God please let me win the lottery
start the countdown until Jay Leno has one
Wish i was part of team corvette too... 😂😅
I dont want it, I need it. I just have to convince my girlfriend.
Will the rims bend and crack easily and GM not offer a warranty replacement as a fuck you to loyal customers like the c7 generation?
Only to be pulled off the road by 2030 due to carbon regulations.
They made him wait forever to get to review a C8. He gets to review the ZO6 hours after announcement.  Safe to say Doug is establishing himself.
I get all giddy every time you come out with a new video.
hmm the front end looks very aventador-ish!
Honestly, the only things I’m worrying about are the build quality and transmission. I’d wonder if GM can build a strong enough transmission to hold 700hp.
Yeah I don't think so it really don't sound that good for a vett
Looks like a Lotus from the side
Z-ZERO-SIX
Skip the signatures of the factory workers
Yo does the zo7 package include the aero package? I don’t know if he ever mentioned it
review a 1987 Chevy S-10
hi Doug. nice vid. liked b4 watching b/c I knew it was goin to be good
So, this is a review of the Z06 model, but it's really more of a Z07 review since this one has that package.
Drinking game: Take a shot every time Doug says Zo7.
