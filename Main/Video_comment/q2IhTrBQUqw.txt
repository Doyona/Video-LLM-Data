My comfort stream
MAGIC
26:00 Rip Jerry
Do the jerma strat
rip Jerry o7
Phantom was actually his partner in crime for real 😱
10:44 No wonder Jerry wants revenge...
best debut stream in the history
This debut is fun the watch!  And seeing you get better at singing and making an original song... I am so proud of you!
Rewatching debuts
That was very entertaining. It was worth watching.
got recommended this, guess I better watch it
I've been watching you for a while now, but realized that I never actually watched your debut. Fixing that now!
Jerry sends his regards.
Just came to rewatch before ARMIS debut. Can't wait for it.
18:20 gimme this folder
Tunnel Snakes Rule!
Love this Hololad
Jesse Eisenberg Energy
Truly the most POG joker
21:24 why did this part get me 😭😭
OMG I IMMEDIATELY LOVED HIM
めっちゃタイプ見つけた！
i keep coming back to this vod. Incredible stuff
Bettel congratulations ❤
顔がめちゃめちゃ良いねー
hello new oshi. Good to see you.
best joke of all time
You are so funny and so handsome
by far the most entertaining debut!
My boy
definitely fits the jester character.
💖
i love him.
Didn't expect the debut to be this funny. One of the best, for sure.
This has to be one of the funniest and manic debuts I've seen. 😂 Excited to see the others and their successes!
He's the energy I need in my life thank you 😌💗
This is bettel’s descent into madness
Dude you are voicing v2 in maxors video
For the benefit of Bettel and anyone else plagued by flying cockroaches, my tactic is to use pretty much anything sprayable that isn't an actual poison (since they usually show up in the kitchen.) Window cleaner is a good go-to. Basically the goal is to make their wings too heavy so they can't fly anymore, after which point disposing of them is no problem.
incredible debut !!! wish you the best on the future
belated congrats on your debut bettel !!! this is genuinely one of the most entertaining debut streams i have watched in a long long time i very much love you and your character literally everything about you and im looking forward to everything you do from here on out 💕💕  literally ive been waiting for a streamer like u to appear my whole life i was laughing the entire time
Wow! What a great debut stream! 💜
That was a wonderful journey
22:34 Dark Souls omg .. i love fromsoft.  & this guy's personality, design, humour, confidence, and generally everything are worth subscribing for tbh
HES SO CUTEEEEE
0k you are 6/10
This was such a great debut! I am few days late but now I see why everyone loved it. Also I can't believe Jerry got blown into pieces. Definitely one of all time.
Jerry? The breaker???
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THIS IS THE SAME GUY WHO SCREAMED "CAPTAIN, LOOK!!!!" ????
So much foreshadowing for what was to come.
There was new members of holostars en? Thanks for letting me know - absolutely none of the news peeps
Fun guy really fun, also love the design than its kinda like a jester with kimono
His luck stat being so high could refer to his incredibly bad luck.
Praying he doesn't become problematic 🏃
This was great well done sir. Also dark souls and jojo, this man knows what’s good
I don't know Hololive Imma try watching 👌
The real joke is that his first scheduled managed to age incredibly poorly in the course of a few days
Magni vs. Bettel: Clash of Chaos I'm ready.
dude's pure chaos for  50 minutes straight,  love it
Awesome sauce
i cant believe bettel died on his debut day
The Magni/Gavis collab about to be chaotic
Based guy who likes jojo and steins gate, nothing but respect
17:04 personal timestamp 😉
Talk about going out with a bang!
🅱ettel
21:25 miss chance to "pull" a cockroach trick
I hope, as a reoccurring gag, Jerry comes back to haunt Bettel as the Phantom of the Peanut Gallery. Like the Phantom of the Opera, but instead of sabotaging chandeliers, he yeets bombs onstage.
He gives off such a chaotic vibe. Befitting for a jester.
I would say this is the funnist debut stream i've ever seen
YOURE SO FUNNY YOU HAVE MY SUPPORT MWAH MWAH
Welcome to the big time, Rookie!
OMG!!!yaaaaa welcome boy
Finally caught up! Lmfaoo this was a great introduction to you AND the bois! Congrats on your debut. I couldn't think of words it was just.. entertaining! Really looking forward to what you guys have in store!
This is a S Tier Debut EVER
A fellow connoisseur of a good 🍅, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure fan, and self-deprecation humor?!  Knock 'em dead out there! 💀  edit: that deadbeat in the peanut gallery, that's me.
New oishi
What a fun debut, you're a great entertainer! Welcome to Holostars and Holopro!
I wonder if he’ll play darkest dungeon?
Bettel radiating that pure Chaotic energy here
Looking at the guild card makes me laugh tbh Jester in the guild party, its just to make them hyped and give buff lol but cant take a single hit during the fight hahahahahahha
💙Do you play 7 Days To Die ?
In terms of VTuber debut streams, this has is the best one i've seen, purely though the lack of cringe alone. Usually I cringe at debut streams that I can't watch them cause the VTuber debuting is nervous and shy, which is understandable, but this didn't feel that much like a debut stream, it came across very much like a really immersive chatting stream. You come across as a natural entertainer, the energy was there and it had me hooked. Overall, super entertaining to watch and is was my clear favourite out of the new debuts, and again, best debut stream i've seen.  Really excited to see your streams going forward!
His whole guild card looks like it was created by Magni, I can’t imagine anyone else going “Heh… Now, hear me out guys, hear me out. What if. What if? There’s this character, right? And his stats are absolutely 0. Nothing. But his luck is so high, it can’t fit in a card. And, and… and he has this s-s-sword, No! More like a… a rapier, and it’s shaped like a child’s balloon toy that they give you at the park. His role - … … his role should be like THE most. useless. thing. IN THE WORLD (can’t suppress his laughter) .. (looks at the chat for a 5-7 seconds, silently) … secretary (coughs a couple times and comes back to the game he was playing)”
the jerma of holostars
I can see where Magni's Copium gasses leaks into. . .
All the hard work Bettel and everyone did for this stream can hardly go unnoticed! You did amazing and thank you for giving us such a fun and entertaining experience! I can’t wait to support you all in your new adventures in HOLOSTARS!!!!  🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅
Your presentation was incredible, welcome to hololive! Can't wait to see more of your streams!
One of the best Vtuber debuts I have ever seen, no cap, you killed it king!
My neuron activation when I saw the font you were using. It's the Adventure Quest Worlds font lmaoo
I hope Jerry is a recurring character tbh
My friend doesn’t like fruits and he also don’t like fruits, that so based 😔😔
Hope Jerry is still alive.
This has been such an incredible debut I had to come back to re watch it after all the live debuts finished. Amazing job in every aspect   Miss Jerry tho…
This guy looks and sounds very fun!
I just realized it's pretty smart to have a debut where thing seem like they're constantly going wrong and failing and you're a nervous wreck. Bettel, you mad genius, you tricked the EN curse.
The debut was really great! Welcome to Holostars, I'm super excited to see what you can bring to Tempus! 💜
His debut is hysterical lmao I love the vibe. Will be here to witness more craziness for sure!
Daym wish I was there for the debut stream but I am loving this guys vibes
Polka's brother
Easily one of the best debuts I've ever seen, I loved every second!! Good luck with all your future plans, I'm excited to see you grow ♥
Another Mob Psycho 100 enjoyer. Perfection.  "Toe cleavage" is NOT something I thought I'd hear today, but here we are.
Welcome to Holostars, Bettel! Congrats on your debut, very well made!
Oh my gosh this is one of the funniest debuts I’ve ever seen 🤣🤣 Can’t wait to see more!
my OSHI
Fantastic debut! I hadn't laughed this much in a while.
This is literally one of the most genius debut ever! I can totally see how much Bettel have prepared for this. My sides hurts from laughing too much LMAO but man I really felt I'm slowly going insane as the debut goes by 😂 but!! Congratulations on your debut Bettel! Welcome to HOLOSTARS!
Honk honk :o)
i laughed so hard during your debut its insane!! all of your visuals and gags during the debut were a delight to watch.  congrats on debuting and im really happy to see you in holostars!
I just love how he calls the chat "ladies and gentlemen" such a charming boi
12:24
OH MY GOD I LOVE HIM!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
As someone named Jerry, this was... an interesting debut.
I just realized that there were debuts...
Bettel: My oshi mark is 🎩  Jesticles: 🍅, take it or leave it
40:50 goofy ahh f
Bettel : PHANTOM Do YOu LoVe mE? ☠️ Phantom:( ＾ = ↀ = ＾)
Congrats on your debut! It was so interesting and your were so funny I laughed a lot. 🤣🎉
Congratulations yayy 🎉
Lmao wasted a whole year of Holopro just to have a debut like this. HololiveEN is going down the drain.
This caught me totally by surprise since I didn't know a new gen was coming out! Much like the OG Tempus tho, I think Hololive struck gold with these guys. I like the funny and unhinged personality this guy has, great start to this new gen
i just saw him and i subscribed he is sooo 🤩
For my German self, the name Bettel has an odd ring to it, since "Bettel" is just a straight up word for junk, and "Bettler" or "Bettelmann" are names for a beggar. Not helped by the fact that he called himself a "Bettel-man" very early on. Well, seeing how Jesters were rarely rich in history, I see a connection.
10:50 Fucking hell XD Love his energy
"WHERE IS HE?! JERRY! LISTEN TO ME!! ON MY BIG DAY... YOUR PLAYING JOKES!!! YOUR KILLING ME!! T-TH-THIS IS RIDICULOUS!! IM THE ONE WHO MAKES JOKES NOT YOU!! GET IT TOGETHER!!!!"    DUDE I LOVE YOU!!
welcome to Hololive 🤗
i love this
Really cool of that one deadbeat to show up for support
badut rasa pesulap
Can I say... how tf did I miss this!!!
We do a little bit of Jesting
Me? Watching this for the third time? Nah.
I'm 8 minutes into watching the VOD and I already set the bell to notify me whenever you stream, you're the best
This man has all of hololive and holostars' comedic timing combined
He is giving me MAJOR Reigen Arataka vibes
I'm not gonna lie, this has to be my favorite debut possibly of all the hologuys. I'm relatively new so a lot of the debuts I've seen are archived and in Japanese, so this is the first one where I was both there live AND the verbal humor hit. His timing and skits were impeccable, his look is on point, his energy was adorably neurotic, and he clinched the absolute market on Pathetic Little Meow Meow real estate. This man's pure gold, and I hope he gets lots more gifts in the future!
😳😳😳
congrats on your debut, Bettel!!
Congratulations on your debut mr funni thank you for the lols
Wow, his hole debut was a show🎉 He really deserve it to be called a jester.
The stats portion got my fcking dying
Such a good debut! I love you. Welcome
he's so good at voice acting! 🫢
Dang that debut stream was a blast
I wonder: if he survived the bomb, did Jerry survived?
i love him and all but do i really wanna be called a jesticle idk man
I love him
I've seen his reference sheet, not worried about cake
We live in a society.
30:23 Calli and Bettel drinking off-collab when!?!
It's show time welcome to holotempus new member
23:55  Golden Kamuy shoutout!  Easily my favourite manga I've read (have read a lot), very similar to the sprawling adventure story of FMAB. Manga finished last year, sadly, but wow, what an amazing ending.  Anime is very good, definitely a sleeper hit. Would highly recommend the manga or anime to anyone interested.
Senpais need to haze the new talent. (5:30, 9:30) 22:05 Co-op with Dez when?
We need a new Jerry!
such an amazing debut stream, looking forward to what this man pumps out   also based jojo man
Lots to talk about: Can I just say how charming this guy is? Bettel just has this creative personality and sense of humor! Candid... that's another sense you get from this guy--- like he's not afraid to be himself. Let's get this out of the way: I'm more into the indie types, but there's something different about this one. Very few streamers I've watched have this unapologetically lovable chaotic personality. Entertainers such as these? They appear once in a blue moon... or should I say purple moon? So it's no wonder why someone like this has already grown a major fanbase-- He's amazing! Outstanding work on your debut.  Never change mate! There's a bright future ahead of you!
The circus is here!
Enjoyed, thats an understatement, I had a blast! Congratulations to your debut!
Amazing debut Bettel and congrats once again! Also, 34:07 ...you're supposed to be a jester not a mind reader...? 💜 Welcome to Tempus, will gift you tomatoes as much as we can 👍 Also, Jerry's okay, right??
I feel like I am watching myself.... Why are you so relatable? Subscribing! 😭👍
デビューおめでとうございます！
THIS WAS AMAZING! THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK!!
This feels like Jerma reincarnated as a Vtuber
Amazing show, Bettel! Ah ah ah ah! Ciao!
Congratulations on your debut, Bettel!! It was so fun and amazing!! 🍅🍅
This was simply spectacular.
Congrats for your debut 🌟  Likes your circus theme, maybe someday you can collab with Polka-san 🐱
Hopefully he plays Master Duel, he will probably love Arlekino and his amazement crew
that was a really impressive debut. I had a good laugh
🌟🙌🏻💖 Congratulations on your debut!
Ikz
In an era and year where there are so many vtuber debuting. I gotta be honest, Bettel debut is definitely one of the best. He making sure that we know the expected information that most vtuber share during the debut while adding his personality, the way he play with assets, his senses of joke, and top tier voice. Definitely making a remarkable first impression for us (viewers). Im cheering for you. 🤡
Love the energy of Bettel. Watching his Streams will be a joy haha!
congrats on your debut!!!
what a masterful debut! welcome to the guild.
Nice debut!
Congratulations on your debut, Bettel! That must have been one of the best debuts I have watched! You're truly an entertainer!!  WELCOME TO HOLOSTARS!!! 🌟
That was great to watch, haven't laughed so hard in a long time!
Stop slaying so much 😭❤️ congrats on your debut !!
thanks for joining holostars!!
I love his voice already!!!
Well,I was Entertained. 😅
I like this funny man. I'm really upset I couldn't watch his debut live. I'm cackling
This guy. Funny, amazing, perfect. Congratulations on your debut Gavis!!
Congrats on your debut and welcome! It was really entertaining, I had a great time. I'll be sure to bring a box of tomatoes when I drop by, I'll make a fortune selling them before the show starts.
Gavis, you are COMPLETELY fucking mad and that's actually kind of perfect.
What a funny, goofy even entertainer 🤌 Looking forward to watching your next livestreams !
Sorry I’m late but YEAH I THINK HE’S MY NEW OSHI AHAHAHAHAH. I LOVEEE funny man(especially with the heels 37:15😩💘)! Your debut is so funny I love it. You did great job, Bettel. Love you🍅💜
Nice to see holo circus slowly adding to its roster lol
he said Halo...based
i love your dedication and energy Bettel! Splendid debut and very entertaining. Congratulations on your debut. Looking forward to your streams.  My take: Bettel is like Polka and Magni combined, with a little bit of Kronii.
Bettel repeating "But you know," straight up gives out Jesse Eisenberg vibe LOL
Congratulations on your debut Bettel!!💖
I LOVE HIM ALREADYYY
januARY FABUARY MARCH APRIL MAY! MAY!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭
19:38 with your stats im not surprised
Never had this much fun on a debut stream
Congratulations on your debut, sir!! Your energy and sense of humor are absolutely CRAZY, I must say I was entertained the whole time. I also really like your voice! I definitely am looking forward to your future streams 💜
He likes jojo and he dresses like speedwagon hahahahah
This is probably the best debut stream I've ever seen
your debut stream is freaking amazing!!
21:25 Ah yes, Slide No. 3:      💀 THE SKELETON APPEARS
Great debut stream Bettel! Guess we're jesticl- hm, I mean Bettelion now right?
YO! Great debute and excited to see you join Tempas :D hope to see you guys with the others soon.  Also, wow, those stats. You are literally the Bill Murray of magic users. (points to anyone who knows what i'm reffing)
NOOO I MISSED IT I’M SO SAAAADDDD :C  CONGRATS ON DEBUTING!!!! SO EXCITED!!!
Don't know how to describe it besides this man feels like he was built for this
It takes real talent to be funny, while pretending to not be funny. Your comedic timing is great.
Big Tekking101 energy lol
I REALLY should not have been drinking water during parts of this. I'm gonna be spending the next ten minutes cleaning this up.
amazingly planned and thought out. Well fit Jester, you are!!!!
>Oldschool Runescape >Jojo's   BASED
congratulation debut BETTEL! your first stream was so fun!! it made me happy!!

So cute!!!
this dude is so fine
Amazing, well-prepared and well-executed debut. What a way to make a first impression
immaculate energy and chaos during this stream. i like your funny words magic man, congrats on your debut!
I feel like Polka and Gavis are colleagues in jokes. Also, Gavis grind way much he maxed out his luck stats. YOOOOO, HE'S A JOJO FAN.
I think bettellion is better so that way we can be called loldiers instead of soldiers
thank you for the funny debut stream!  welcome to holostars
Congrats on your debut Bettel!! You did great!
I couldn’t stop laughing the entire time I watched your stream. I don’t think Cover Corp could’ve picked a better jester.  You started out strong being the first to debut. Welcome to Tempus!!
Such a great debut! I was laughing the whole time! The Jesticles will accept the name eventually! 🍅  Also, that cut off scream was golden 🫶🏼 👀 yoooo Taurus! 3 days before my bday!!!!
What a performance! So energetic. I hope he'll get the rest he needs for tomorrow.
Man, you’re so funny, the whole debut was amazing, I wasn’t even bored for a sec. Here’s a little gift for you 💝
Alright, I'm liking this guy already
Pretty funny guy all around, amazing debut stream and you seemed pretty chill in the collab, I like the kind of content you can produce if you have the time to make it, can't wait to watch your streams and see how you perform on a day to day streams!
BETTEL!!! CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR SUCCESSFUL DEBUT!!! 💖👏🏻 THAT WAS AMAZING, i really can't wait to watch your streams!!! KEEP JESTING!!!!!!

10:44 I'll do it again
I've never laughed this hard at a debut. I smell a new oshi.
Congratulations on the debut!
Oh wow. A real life Tomato Merchant!   He maxxed out his worst stat. He's like me for real for real. I like his energy. Watch him be the most sane and subdued one in all of Tempus.
Congratulations on your debut, Gavis !! Welcome to Holostars~

If this hilarious experience was just you debut i can't wait to see all you future streams, welcome to the Tempus gang, already a fan. RIP Jerry he will be missed 🍅
if bettel has million number of fans bettel is one of them. if bettel has ten fans bettel is one of them. if bettel has only one fan then that is bettel. if bettel has no fans, that means bettel is no longer on earth. if the world against the bettel then bettel is probably screwed
WOW
