I love cam Cassey experiments
Science:  If male plants a seed into female, a baby is born.  this guy:  does that actually work!
Everyone:wow the egg went in  Me:How will it come out Me being an Indian: why is egg being wasted
Me:How is he gonna get it out💀  My mind: he is gonna put the burning tissue outside the bottle😂
Is that a boiled egg or unboiled egg
It's boiled egg now rawww eggg
We did this experiment at school when I was 8 ... To make you understand how our world evolves
My testimony is I was stuck in sin and my thought had so so so much sin and I tried to stop them but I couldn’t so I pray and ask for forgiveness and to help me and keep praying because I know God will help me so every day And ready my Bible I tried to read my Bible every day and God  helped me and they went away the devil  tried to still tempt me but God takes them out and I rebuke all negative thoughts and prayer every day . And remember this remove all negative things out of your life and This is important God works on his time  get saved by praying this prayer and you have to mean it (God I realize that I am a sinner and I am so sorry but you Sind your only son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for our sins and who believes she’ll be saved and she’ll not perish but live for eternity in heaven and I thank you in Jesus name amen ) and read your holy Bible every day and re Jesus Christ is king and he is in heaven❤️ I love you but God loves you more
😮😮😮😮😮😮💚💚💚💚💚😄
This experiment is in my science book so this have to be true
He tests the things that are the most obvious pls do the more challenging ones to figure out
fake The Bottle is big
It's simple science bro 😐
*if you light a house on fire it burns* Casey:dOeS thAt aCtuAlly wOrk?
Now how are you going to remove the egg from bottle  😂😂
The air pressure pull the egg down
0:42 just saving this for later nothing special
Obviously is goanna work n it's called Charles's law brooooo 😎
Any video I Saw you came there And Said............. This Actually WORKED🤪😳😜😜😜😜😜😜😜
"if idiots could fly, TikTok would be an airport."                    - A Random Guy
I like how did you tell. Is that actually work. Let's find out!
The egg made a noise '''POP"'
When the first guy did it I thoughtit was a chick
The only reason is fix is because  is burning  the egg and the egg go in
Nice, now I know how to make a vacuum canon
I don’t even know what to say-
Yeah it works, i had displayed this scientific phenomenon in my junior school(7 years ago) science exhibition and won 1st prize for this.
No shit captain obvious
Some one:if you eat a goat you will be a butterfly.  Cam:Do ThAt aCtUaLlY WoRk?LeT SeE.
But.. how do you get it out?
In fact: Flames absorb Oxygen, which is part of the air, thereby means flames also absorb air. That is why the egg moves down into the bottle. If this didn't happen, then the bottle has leak.
Man it's just physics and it has to do with the atmospheric pressure.
Do the roar
i dont trust till i see party shirt do it
There is something called ✨science✨
If you put your hand in water your hands gets wet  This dude: Does that actually work?
Scientific theory When heat is transmitted their the vaccum occuars while it air does a tentensi to get the vaccumed place so the egg is pushed inside Simple🥴🇮🇳
Yo what is the egg not hard-boiled
Tiktok Guy:if you do a fore in your House It Will Burns  Cam: that actually work?
"If you don't press the brake while driving your car then you'll keep going and eventually crash into something" This guy- does that actually work? *crashing noises*
Him: If you murder someone you will go to prison. Also him: LETS DO IT.
how do you gonns let the egg get out of terep
God;your name is going to be camcasey on earth!  Him:is that actually work! 😂😂😂😂
“watch what will happen to the hard boiled egg when the newspaper lit is on fire in the” man that first guy was on something else when making this
If you eat some food you will be full let's see it's actually works
5 grade science dun dun duuuuuuuunnnnnn 😱
Tiktoker:I opened toothpaste 😱😱  Him:does that actually work?
if you throw somthing it will come back him:does that even work?
haha with boiled egg and easy
The vacuum that is created when fire burns inside a bottle
This guy annoying asfk even when he keep drinking the bang like bro u is not gonna get sponsored
This is fake you can see the eggs skin off that’s what makes it slippery
Don't you listened your Science lesson
Tʜᴀᴛs ɴᴏᴛ ʀᴇᴀʟ ᴇɢɢ
Haven’t even seen the end of the video but yes it works that was a science experiment we did in fourth grade
Now how do you get it out
Guys don’t try this at home😉
Did that boi just throw a perfect good stick in there? (Joint)
🤯🤯🤯
That one guy on tiktok:if you use cocaine your gonna have sharingan eyese  This guy:does that actually work?
Someday he's gonna try and fit himself in that bottle and somehow succeeds.
Looks like someone skipped some physic classes in highschool 😁😁😁
This is basic fucking science
Of course it worked….
Him accidentally makes a molotv
Stooooop!!!!!!!!!
If you burn a house down u dont need tax money Him: DOES THAT WORK
I don’t want this channel to pop up in my YouTube stories. Even if I haven’t subscribed, this shit keeps on popping. Useless, brainless videos. It gets me irritated when he says “is this actually works”. Stupidity at it’s level. That’s why school is important.
If you light a stick of dynamite it will blow up!  This guy: does that actually work?
Ok seriously all of these comments are the same like “ if you stick a knife threw someone, they will die? Let’s try it out “ 😐
imagine not grasping the fundamentals of physics
Bro thats so rigged Hahahah ur being one pf doess it clwerly boiled
2 things, this dude has a brain as smooth as they can get, and it's illegal to not disclose your sponsorship with bang
Lol it's a boiled egg
It works with a regular- GOD I swear no one here has ever watched Brain Games.
If you hit you phone with hammer it will get cracked.  Mean time This guy : Is that actually work, let's try it out?  😂😂😂
Random tiktoker: if you pull a pin from a grenade nothing happens  This guy: does this actually work?
This is Basic Science People
Dang the first guy was on FIRE tho that flow!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
See the science is so simple (for anyone who doesn't know) if you keep a burning napkin or whatever inside a container which has a slightly smaller opening the a hard boiled egg, and place a hard boiled egg on opening, the fire then burns the oxygen inside which then causes the egg to fall inside. And the fire goes out because the inside is filled only with vapors and, not a gas which can be burnt.

Already knew this but it still looks cool haha
I know how you can skip the entire video, just read the description and done.
Go back to school
I am everywhere
BANG ENERGYYYY😎😎😎😎 Not sponsered🤓🤓
That was commensen se
If you choke some one they’ll stop breathing  This guy: does that actually work  Let’s find out
Ah. This is simple hot air moved out creating vaccum inside and when it cool a bit and puttin a egg the  atmospheric air put pressure on the egg to match the outer and inner pressure and the pressure it so high it squeeze the egg in.   You can try this with an empty can put in a spoon of water and heat it on stove and then cover the opening with a cork or something as it seal properly then put water on the can and it will.......  Try it and then comment 👍
Bang is kinda tastes ling SHIT tbh
It's basics thing You learn on school wtf
Hey gotta give credit to him for doing such simple tasks so we don't have to
Where do people go after death This Man :Lets find out
If u trip u will hurt ur self Him:does that actually work?
For anyone else who may not know this I'm fairly certain I learned the trick from full house
Bang is trash
Fake
How to make a egg launcher in 3 simple steps

Wow they figure out how fire used air and when the top is plugged the suction pulls the egg down
"stab someone heart and died"  This guy: does that actually work?
Why always drinking bang ..
How do i get this egg out?
A hardboiled egg lol
I guess this guy is a newborn kid in a 20year old's body
Do it without boiling
It is an boiled egg
His voice is kinda like Sydney Morgan
Rost bang drink
POV:You are looking for a comment that’s actually original.
It’s hard boiled so it’s squishy right
The real question is how do you get it out
"throwing lit matches on your carpet sets your house on fire"  This guy:"does that actually work?"
If you drink 10 gatorade’s you will grow  Him: dose this actually work LETS FIND OUT
But how you get it out 😱🤨👉🏻👈🏻
He is like a kid learning about the world
Hes the type of dude to wake up someone and ask are you sleeping
How do u get it out
It doesn't have to be boiled
Looks like he just woke up
Way to show why kids needs to go to school.
This is what happens when you bunk your science class
Palos que hablan español esto no es un truco solo que el huevo que utilizan está soplado y el huevo de vuelve muy fragil y blando por eso pasa la botella
That's boild egg
"If you go outside, you are outside" Him: Does that actually work?
I did that at school
It's Simple Science. NOTHING NEW 🙃
Pls never show fake because I like u r video
For all the dummy’s the flame is making a vacuum witch is sucking the egg in.
Impossible
The first 6 seconds sounded like some song
It was already cooked
You wasted a egg 😑👎
Bruh I learned this in daycare
Y would I waste egg bro
How do u remove the egg 😭
😑
Now get it out of the bottle.
Or maybe just put the egg on top of the bottle and maybe will go in
Fire uses up oxygen aka “air” so it will suck the egg. Tik toker achievement unlocked: “third grade science”
Bruh  I'm not surprised why ure a tiktoker
No shit get a life
Nice video man, just ignore hate comment
This is the reason scientists are searching for a new planet
Soooo dumb. 🙂
Its called basic physics, and now how will you get the egg out
Don't go to school and every day shall be an miracle to you.
When he says does that actually work  He proved he didn't either paid attention to class or didn't go to school
ผมเคยเรียนตั้งแต่ป.2 โตขนาดนั้นไม่เคยเรียนหรอครับ ขนาดประเทศผมมีควายเป็นนายกอะนะ
Ok the egg went into the bottle, then what? How will you throw the egg out of the bottle? As a guy who was raised by a strict asian family, breaking the bottle or throwing the whole bottle set is so wasteful and it makes me uncomfortable.
Another braincell gone forever
Does anyone actually drink bang energy without getting paid
"if you stab someone in the heart they will die" This guy: "Does that actually work"
Someone: Breaths  This guy : _does that actually work_
What.
Quit breaking the law, you  Unapologetic terd
"If you jump from Eiffel tower you will die" Him: is this actually work? Lets find out Him: it's actually work(while ghost goint to hell)
This man really wants that bang sponsor
Bang is TRASH
I don’t see a difference between these two guys, not one.
Am I the only one thinking how he is gonna get that out lol
This guy just steals everyone’s thunder he remakes videos that people make and then he gets paid for it that’s such bullshit
Basic suction due to pressure gradient. What's so special? So sad you had to try this out.
The cup was too big so it was obviously going to work
Tell me the vid is sponsored by bang without telling me that the vid is sponsored by bang
Slices wrists deeply and dies This guy: DoEs ThIs AcTuAlLy WoRk
Did anyone see that the egg was already boiled?
Umm did y'all not pass science or something
I would have eaten that egg :(
These are the people who dropped out of school and barely learning 2nd grade science
Is the dude with glasses your brother? Because I honestly can’t tell lol
Looks very funny
As the fire burns, it sucks oxygen into the bottle. It's also sucking hard enough to pull the egg in
The bang can is perfectly aligned with the camera so it shows the brand
Honestly by this point he should just start watching life hack Vines.
How will you take it out
Did this in elementary school lol
If you shoot a blue portal on one end and the orange portal on the other end then you can actually teleport :D (find it out in real life bTcH)
"I can go to jail by murdering someone"   This guy: does that actually work?                 Let's find out

Get man some braces and a hair brush fuck sakes
Bro acts like he’s never taken a science class in his fucking life
Even kids knows that wth is going with you tiktoker this days
You are mad
Fake. Already boiled
"Watch what will happen when the hard boiled egg when the newspaper lit is on fire in the."
https://youtube.com/channel/UCnNEBz-nqUWOuIHOmHdrNtg
Does the wheel still amaze this guy??   He seems to have missed most if not all of any basic science classes.
these guys are evolving   but backwards
Tell me you are sponsored from bang without saying me you are sponsored from bang
"If you kill someone, they die" This guy: let's see if this actually works
Now you have an egg in a bottle. Congratulations
Try to get it out, lol
Someone:dies due to burning This guy : is that actually works . let's find out He self harm buy burning himself (but don't dies) This Guy: kind of work
Wow you did a 2nd grade physics trick without knowing how it works. That's dumb
"No it doesent affect my baby... Anyway pass the joint harold."
Yes it does work, it’s basic chemistry.
The real question is, How are you planning to get the boild egg out the bottle?
okay but how do you get it back out again. also literally everyone knows you can do that, it’s called science.
Are you stupid? Are you that type of kid to give himself a nose bleed and complain “I can’t do anything like thisss” just to get out of science class?
Telor nya dh mateng
ITS SCIENCE they teach u I’m like 7th grade not that hard
Washed brains
Its saad how new generations dont know nothing me and my friends from Serbia knew this and simillar things with aproximatly seven years! poor new degenerations
Suddle bang sponsor +500$
The egg is boiled
This dude clearly didn’t pass the how to walk if he doesent know that this is actually real
If you got a bang can you can open it and drink Cam Casey does that actually work?
Dude looks like he drinks no water, just Bang..
Bang is not going to sponser you
Guy: lights house on fire him: does that actually work let's find out
U guys didn't go to school?
So if you’re wondering how this works, fire burns oxygen right? Meaning oxygen is disappearing, creating empty space, which in turn makes a vacuum. Thus, sucking the egg into the bottle. Basic science.
when you forgot how to school
I feel like this was a perfect opportunity to promote something
why is there a bang there?
Why does the other guy look like Scott the woz
Cam Casey is the worst
I have never fucking seen this why are yall acting like you did this in grade school? This is cool as hell.
You seriously just watched a video of it working
god i hate this type of content. "does that actually work" is just code for "im finna steal this content under the pretext of me not believing it but i just want the views this other dude got"
Someone: *breaths*    Him: does that actually work?
They are evolving... Maybe in a few more decades we will get to multiplication.
To this day he’s still trying to get a bang sponsorship
If you aren't blind you can see  Him: DoEs ThAt WoRk??
This shit was learned inna 3rd grade bro sooo cool
Oldest trick in the book
Guy: hangs himself  Every tiktoker in  the universe: "DOeS tHaT aCTuALlY WoRK"
Are we gonna ignore this guy is literally stealing content
Imagine your entire personality is being an advertisement for a mediocre energy drink
How to get Covid  Him Does that actually work
The fake sip in the beginning of the video kills me every time
His friend looks cracked out ngl
I remember in elementary some scientists came and did that and I was like 👁👄👁
No way I did this too!!!     In 4th grade
These are grown ass adults that don't understand basic shit
Its common sense😐
“Getting shot in the kneecaps cripples you” “Does it actually work?”
“If you turn the key, it unlocks a door”.  Him: “does that actually work?”
Bang energy watching this video: man we need to sponsor this dude.
He was born on this planet just to copy people’s videos
Vacuum and sucktion
Jesus... what do these kids get taught in school... It's a vaccum an you only need the match... My kids are 12 n 10 n run circles around these tiktok ducks...
Bang product placement confirms your low level of intelligence
STOP.
Goddamnit!
Lol you shouldn't have had to test it to know that lol
Kindergarten kid: did you know 1 plus 1 is two?  Him: does that actually work kid?   Comment and like if this was funny 👍
Love this guy
And humanity find fire
Ummmm second grade science, but I forget we live in a world where dumbass teachers are teaching kids how to be transgender
They can’t be that stupid, please tell me this is scripted. My generation will be the only worthy one left after this apes run the world
Hmmmm can anyone guess who sponsored this video
Everyone of these vids are just either dangerous, lacking in common sense, or completely brainless.
The burning napkin creates a vacuum when the egg is placed on top of the bottle, the vacuum effect sucks the egg inside
Did he just call the bottle a "tube"?
What if he finds out that you can convert a potato into a small battery...
ah yes 6th grade science class knowledge
That bang can is way too close to the edge
Why was 1st guy trying to rhythm
Bang bang you got the eng 😳
Tell me your sponsored by bang without telling me your sponsored by bang
I was going to watch it but that Second guy with the messy hair just ruined it.
OML wooooooooooooow 🙄
Oh my goodness, I'm sure everyone learnt this in school
Dud did you skipped school
Do they not do this kind of stuff in school anymore. Wheres Bill Nye when u need him. Sheessh
This dude is old enough to have a tattoo on his arm and he doesn’t know elementary level physics
Bang shit drinks...never had one but if they are these kids vids I know they're shit
It’s because the fire is burning the oxygen in the bottle which sucks the egg in.
Cap
how do you gonna make it go tho
How much is Bang paying you?
Someone missed science class
He's so stupid for wondering if it works. People who doesnt know why this work should Really go back to school, jeezus. Whats gonna Happend to the world with that lost generation
I love how science we used to learn in kindergarten is impressive to young people now. He probably doesn’t know what’s happening anyway.
Just watched an actual video, of something that a lot of us did in school....does that actually work?!? Mind blown...
In my country we actually dont learn about this shit so it's new to me too (I'm 15)
Sometimes I can’t comprehend how people don’t understand how vacuum seals work
Am I this old to find this stuff common sense?
how do you get it out tho
I know this
I hate this fucking world at times!
Y'all are mean as shit, dudes just curious and wants to share his reaction to experiments he found on the internet
Product placement
Bruh have you never been to public school?
The guy:Does that actually Works.
Mai goad this is literally 1st grade physics
OMG... I'm an adult behaving weird on the net...my parents would be so proud. This generation is a circus.
we may mock this guy, but he has the heart of  scientist. He doesn't just look at it in theory, he has to do it him self to validate the accuracy. When the government and media lie to us, he will be the one beacon of truth we can rely on.
THIS IS BASIC PHYSICS!!! BASIC!!! These people DO NOT pay attention in school.
My God you are annoying and have nothing Original. Imagine being rich and Talentless...oh that's my reality 🙄
Ofc this works the oxygen in the bottle is getting burnt by the fire and it's doing a pressure to the egg and its pulling it 😑
If you breathe in, your lungs get inflated....
Did this dude never have a science lesson in the 2nd grade?
Bruh the oxygen gets burnt by the flame so it pulls in the egg
This is why EDUCATION is important !!
Do they all stop with the question "does this work?" or are any trying to figure out "why it works"?
How  do you get the eggs out?
Nice Top quality. That genuine excitement is something most science teachers lack. Keep em coming.
What happened?! Couldn't see past your *Bang*
I’m concerned as to what went through his mind putting a burning napkin and an egg in a bottle the first time
Does this guy even have a job?
That guy that says   lets find out is kinda creepy to me
This should be made for kids specifically
I thought that the first guy was wasting a huge blunt just to make an egg explode
Maybe use a bigger bottle next time maybe the egg wil stay on top of the bottle
Basic physics but he also had a huge top to the bottle
Can I nominate this dude for the first ever man to fly into space and land on the sun?
Kids don’t do what he did. Do it at your friends house so if something bad happens there house is destroyed not yours👍
"I can get to jail just by murdering someone." This guy: "Does that actually work?"
Yeah heat rises whats new?
Did this dude skip middle school science or sum? Both 6 and 7th grade science has this lesson
*the guy eats Cook food*  This guy:“Does this actually work"                    “lets find out"
I mean you can just push the egg in or... Ya know actually eat it
Dis Guy:"Did he really died getting bitten by a snake?" Dis guy: " "
i am surprised that paper didn’t burn away quicker- pls yall use flameproof gloves or oven mitts if you’re holding something that’s burning
"I can breath with my mouth"  He: "Omg does this actually work?"
This guy : makes tik tok of things expanding on heating and earning millions Literally every 5th grade physics teacher showing the same thing **cries in minimum wage**
If you havk ticktock and click delete, ticktock no more.  Him: Does that actually work?
The blonde guy looks like the guy that has black hair and wears black glasses from Dhar mann, I think his name is “Carlos” I forgot his name lol
That bottle is wasted now along with the egg
Wow, physics
Tell me you're sponsored by bang without telling me you're sponsored by bang:
Is that drink product just sponsoring every fucking tik toker to promote there brand??? Confused why they don't need to declare what they are doing
I think there's a homeless man in ur house
I knew it..
Only if he knew basic physics and pressure.
Okay, that egg is in, and I’m sure you got no brain in your head.
Nobody cares about your stupid energy drinks
Who is behind you man
Y’all really didn’t go to chem/basic science in high school did you?
Recycled content man
Wow nice boiled egg we not Ed
Shoves it in by hand: “does this actually work”
Partyshirt someone tag them
Oldest science experiment I know. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 These guys live under a rock.
Fun fact: most fun facts aren’t fun. Their just facts Bonus fact: all of the comments are jokes about him saying “will that actually work?”
Now......get the egg out.
If you actually would have studied something in school you wouldn't have test it dumbass tik tokers these days man fml 🤡
“My dad leaves to get milk” Cam:Does dat actually work ?!?!?
How come you dont know this? Do you live in a cave?🤣🤣🤣
Before you copy someone's vid, remember to ask " does that actually work?"
😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯
Someone figured out how pressure works 👏 👏
Its like watching 1st graders learn about physics
Wow.something i learned in grade 1.
Don’t homeschool your kids
These tries at gaining a sponsorship are hilarious lol
Now he will try to colonise mars...
“If you snap someone’s neck they will die” Him: does that actually work? *let’s find out*
Cretins
Clap clap for the handicap
I'm not the only one who thinks this is idiotic, right?
Killer: if you stab a man with a knife he will die. This guy: does that actually work...
If you stab someone hard enough they will die. DOES THAT ACTUALLY WORK??
This goes to show that our school system doesn't teach science anymore.. I learned this as a kid..
I call this Cocaine Kyle, just because it seems to make sense.
Does this actually work?  The idiot ignorant asks.........
Ok,now get the egg out without braking it ..😂
This guy didn't pass kindergarten did he?
Sponsored by bang[TM]
Does his brain actually work ???
"This morning, a 36 year old woman was brutally murdered using a butter knife" dOeS thIS AcTualLy WOrK??!?
The bang just sitting there
And this video is sponsored by bang
Bro.... take a high school science class...
Cam Casey funny
People talking about how Tiktokers know basic physics while I'm just surprised these idiots know how to boil an egg
Ok ok ok 1. Ofc it will work it’s basic physics  2. They show u that in school how do u not all ready know about that 3. The hole at the top of that jar u had was already big enough for the egg to fall in
It'd be more amazing if there was a shell on it
They're evolving ... Just backwards.
Imagine going to school
I like bang but this forced advertizment discourage me from buying it
I think we gotta contact Bill nye for this
If you eat meth you get high  Him I know that works but let’s try it
I thought the first guy was spitting some rhymes for a sec
"If you put blatant product placement in a video, will anyone notice that you're just doing the same thing someone else has already done?"
Its so obvious when someone's sponsored by bang, just say you're sponsored!!
Smart way of just copying others
Bro these comments make me feel so stupid “this is basic physics. I learned this in 3rd grade” like wtf. All I learned in 3rd grade was all the planets, multiplication, and some grammar stuff.
Tiktokers are learning basic physics? It’s like we’re watching evolution.. but backwards soon they’ll be entering the Stone Age
IQ test
"If I take off my seatbelt will I actually go through the windshield? Let's find out"
Everyone gansta until you can’t get the egg out of the bottle
_”If you turn a light switch on, it turns on.”_ This guy: “Does this actually work?”
Me just thinking how I'd throat that egg in one.
This proves they don't have friends amd too much time on their hands. Get a life lol
Am i the only one thinking that those are boiled eggs? Like I no longer see the interesting part in this with them being boiled and about as structurally strong as wet tissue paper...
There learning this isnt good
Gringos
How did we devolve to the point of having to relearn elementary science again.
شبیه احمقایید
Fire sets you on fire.  Him: Does that actually work?
Ah yes a normal video of a egg falling in a bottle
Others: wow, we could do that. Me: why tf did he peel that egg like that
When you didn’t pay attention in 2nd grade
PV=nRT
Ok, now you can graduate from 2nd grade science.
Watches things work......does it actually work? Gets surprised it worked. Great
😂😂
I knew that in grad 4 already
Bang is the worst drink ever do not buy
Brought to by bang
Cam: *sees video on how to get free robux*  Cam: does that actually work? Let’s Find Out!
I haven't went to physics in a while can someone explain this for me please?
All you had to do is put the match in the bottle. Add egg on top. Egg in Bottle. Learn this in elementary
If you blind you will not see anything  Tiktoker:Did that actually work?  Let find out =))
Bro I’m waiting the day this stupid tictokers see another tictokers kill someone and be like does that work
I learned this trick from Full House
I wonder if he’s sponsored by bang
Why should I want to put a egg in a bottle?
It’s almost as if I didn’t do this in the 3rd grade 😐
This was on Full House 25 years ago
Yall complaining about this but at least he’s TESTING it instead of faking it lmao
Nerd
Bang Energy Nohomo
“DoEs tHaT aCtUalLy wORk”
Ofc this works bruh this was shown on full house
I really hope that they were just trying to make up a quick tiktok for their sponsor bang otherwise I would be disappointed
Monkeys experience basic physics and obviously making an add out of it
This dude watching a tiktok: here's how you open a door This dude also: does that actually work?
Not only an annoying tiktoker, but an annoying tiktoker stealing other peoples content for money.
people who didn't pay attention in class are fascinated by this ...
Bro it obviously work they show you it works 😂😭
That's why people you should always pay attention in your classes..
Me: damn, there goes breakfast.
Nice bang advert
Cam use something u came up with,ok bro?
The egg was already  cooked
But what's the point?.....
Man:    Pulls out his wallet        Him:    Does that actually work?
Isn't this basic science? Wtf do they teach in school now? How to post on tictoc or something?
Cool can’t wait for kids to try this at home
Why his friend sounds like DentalDigest??
It’s simple, but I’ll put it into ape words just for you  Fire like air Fire eat air Are now gone If air gone everything wants to take place of air Egg take place of air Now egg in bottle
he called the a bottle  a tube and yall talking  about   him doing second grade science
Bang sponsoring these clowns only makes me want to buy it even less
Didn't work the whole egg jumped in like ur all jump up.c nts
Oh wow... Physics
I just dont understand what's wrong with this guy ! Does he even has a brain ? Like why will someone keep on uploading stupid videos knowing that people are still gonna hate it and abuse him ! Doesn't he has any self-respect ?
ayo what the fuck?
A bang sponser is learning basic physics😳 wow amazing
This guy does meth you can tell by his meth face
It's basic science
Must be nice to get this many subs/views using the work of others.
It just slid into the 2nd bottle it wasn't sucked in tfoh
When the newspaper lit is on fire? Definitely a wordsmith over here
ProTip: Use hot water instead of news paper.  Use: Egg Wii be eatable
Oh for fucks sake
Hey bang energy. I will never ever try your drink because it obviously kills more brain cells than snorting moonshine. Drop him or Sue him.
The fact that you sound like a complete idiot at the start of your videos, then proceed to rob another person's video idea, just to see " does that actually work"?? Makes me wish there was a freaking block button on you tube. I dont want to see your knock off 5th grade science videos. It makes me even more mad that posting to your video gives you attention.
they look like they wont reach 40...
Yes, 20 years ago my teacher did this with a water jug from the collagen man
Wow it’s almost like vacuums exist
Kids learn this at 7. Dumb shits
OMG THEY ARE LEARNING 2ND GRADE STUDF NOW IM SOO PROUD OF THEM!
Ah yes, top of the range recycled content, gotta love the quantity over quality mentality of our generation.
Wow crazy it’s not like I learnt this at school it’s almost as if it is basic science 🙃
“iF yOu sTaB soMEoNE thEY wiLL diE Him: “dOes tHAt aCtUaLLy WoRk?”
Old timers basically used the same method on boils , places stung by fish etc , splinters etc to drawl the infection or object out .
I thought this was cool. I like how people feel somehow superior just because a tick tocker uploaded this
Bro, it just fell in the bottle. It didn’t get sucked in. HOLY CRAP TIK TOK IS AWFUL
*apple falling from the tree to the ground* Tiktokers:"does this actually work?"   Pewdiepie:"Mmmmmmh"
His parents must be proud
Definitely not sponsored by bang……….
i wonder if they're being paid by a certain energy drink company
It even works with a non boiled egg
0:23 his face at the end...
Have you seen Big Bang Theory??? The same 2nd grade science experiment is by Professor Proton
Now take it out
Bang Energy: just have idiots drink our cans in tik toks
Full house and bill nye taught me this long ago
Is all the tiktokers is this dumb?
Physics.. Idiot..
Hope in humanity is lost
Bang Energy is so disgusting
Product placement much
This is literally an ad
Tiktokers always amazed by simple things...😂😂😂 They r stupid
The fire kills the oxygen creating a vacuum. What are kids learning in school these days? To see an adult not know this scares me. Dumb people can make money on YouTube for sure. These are the co called new role models of the future.
Its called physics
Do they not teach science in school anymore?
Atleast use a tighter bottle. It's not cool when the egg can fit even without doing the trick.
Schlechtes Video
I’m sorry but any kid who doesn’t know about atmospheric pressure changes clearly lack a education.
They're evolving but just.......backwards
This is why you need to pay attention to physics classes
SOMEBODY BEEN WATCHING  FULL HOUSE
DoEs tHaT aCtUaLly wOrK
We did this in school
does that work = easy content steal
It’s called science.
Lol, they never learn Science
Girlfriend: This relationship ain't working This guy: DoEs ThAt AcTuAlLy WoRk?
does that actually work bang energy promotion...... we know it works. you just want to make a copy cat video with a bang endorsement.... they call this guy a content creator.... content scalping and place an ad in it.... make your money but just know it takes no skill
The egg seals the top while the heat creates a vaccum.
The next generation is stupid and soon they'll get the keys to our country. Weep for us all.
So how much is Bang paying you to do these childhood experiments?
He's the kinda guy that looks at the tutorial and be like, does that really work.
By buring the paper it is using up oxygen. Once you plug its oxygen source it will create a vacuum. Hence it pulls the egg through with suction because it’s soft.
Did no one learn about this in second grade?
When you have to include your little brother
Cool. Also did you know if you stick a fork in a plugged in toaster it was melt the fork and make these super cool lights 😳😳😳😳 it’s crazy please try it out
https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMd9CSR16/
Ngl I never knew that or the teachers never taught me that
Everyone commenting "basic physics" nigga I've seen like 30 of these and not a single one was taught at my school, not everyone knows everything
It’s cus the fire is depleting the oxygen so essentially depressurizing and the egg is getting sucked in because of that
🤮
Why can’t you just eat that hard boiled egg
Ghada
... this is so basic... The fire kills all the oxygen and creates a vacuum when the egg is on top... The vacuum tries to suck air in and the eggs goes into the bottle...
Like the not-so-subtle product placement
Cam Casey no brain tiktoker
Dude, this guy has no brain. He tried to know if an obvious physic works
This dude made a fat stack of cash by just casually saying "wAiT, dOeS tHaT aCtUaLLy wOrK ?"
First dude was wholesome
Really not a energy drink ad
Nice, wasting food for nothing. GG
Dude quit with the overly showing bang. They are more than likely not going to sponsor idiots who dont understand physics. Then again stupid people are getting more and more famous.
Questioning basic physics. Tik tok cancer
"Does that actually work?" Did you even go to fucking school?
Can I stop seeing this nigga holy shit
Yeah but how are u gonna eat the egg now.
That's thermal expansion right there
Works better with the shell still on.  Science grade 3... ...
That one Egg... anybody in this World are hungry..
Aw ... come on ! ..if you didn't do that in the infants school..what the he'll did you do ?
How will that come out? 😂
Imagine the catharsis they went through, it must be life changing for them
Because of You’re Video i will never buy this bang Drink. The Vid is not even marked as an Ad.
He held the can wrong he didn't even drink it
Lay off the bang you're starting to look a little haggard lol
80% of tiktokers have to start their school life over from day one
Guy: Kills 20,000 people with nuke  Him: Wait, does that actually work?
School: am i joke to you?
This guy looks like he lives off bang energies
The fuck, thats a thing u know when u around 9 or 10
I need another tiktoker to that confirm the tricks the second guy checks - actually work.
I swear this guy looks younger🤔 I guess bang energy make's you age faster
Next thing you know, he sees someone stabbing someone so he trys it too.
If you look real close, you'll notice that the egg in the bottle
This dude is an actual pepega
Wowwwww amazing first discovered in human history
Is this reality now, are people this idiotic?
This is how stupidity works.
Finally, for once HE does not say “does that actually work?
atleast he’s not scamming his fans 😹
EGG IN DA BOTTOL LESS GOOOO
Sponsored by bang
omg second grade physics??? woah
Secret bang advertising
Oh I am Seeing an Evolution in this species
Bang commercial be like
Every human beings will know it will suck in      except tiktokers 🤣🤣
Oh no he brought a friend...
Thats literraly useless but ok
It’s not a tube
Wow simple physics works
His friend in the intro is so wholesome :P. I'd totally be his friend
I need to lower my IQ to watch this bruh
Ok are we just not gunna talk about the way he said that sentence?
When watching too much cringe tiktok killed most of your brain cells
Wow congrats you learned something every elementary school kid knows.
You can put a egg with just fire  most people:…wtf is fire
Bruh seriously 😐
Simply wasting food
What were these kids taught in elementary school??? American basic knowledge disgusts me
So you are basically doing science created for small children and you do not even know if it works?? I weep for humanity
Dude that first guy talking was having an absolute stroke, you can't convince me otherwise
Him: does that actually work?!?  Me: sigh.... goddamn it son...
So now you have a egg in a bottle
People: school should teach us pay taxes and not this random knowledge so I won't study  That people 5 years after: thats magical
What if i put something bigger and longer..?        Like my problems..
How do you take the egg out 🤨😅😂
seriously considering the state of our schools and education system as a whole...
wow these guys never went to any science class
Man that bang energy fucken up his brain.
I love this channel so much, it let's me know how smart I am. Would recommend!10/10
Didnt you got ot school? OMG.
*a guy stab's hem self and it hurts*       Dos that work? Lets find out!
5yr olds can easily figure out that there hard boiled eggs without a shell
That scam dude: I went 72 hours without sleeping.  This dumb dude: dOeS tHaT aCtuAlLy wOrK?
flush toilet Tiktok: does that actually works?
Fact : You already knew it works...
Why'd the first guy say it so rhythmically
never went to school
When you bunked your science lectures 😁
Boooo👎👎👎
What is this full house?
Yay it actually worked. So happy for you buddy. Did you learn to count to 10 yet? 💕😊
This is getting out of hand, now there's two of them😭
I can only imagine less people buying this BANG drink when degens on tiktok get paid to brand it
Yep, we all can tell that he didn't go to school OR listen And SHEEESH good job learning a gr2 gay lussac's law
This BING ad should be illegal
The flame buns through the oxygen inside the bottle, the egg prevents more air (oxygen) from common inside which creates a vacuum inside the bottle which in turn sucks the egg inside. Now you know that it works and you know HOW it works.
do tiktokers even have an education?
People are stupid
Try to check what happens if you inhale zykon b for too long I want to know if it works
Newton's Gravitational law will be next.
1 minute of silence for the bottle and the egg
It doesn't take much to peel egg shell properly. Also, I see tiktokers are starting to evolve, they're starting to understand science.
It's called a vacuum
If you ever feel useless then remember his mom exists
Damn, he's smart. He's a tiktoker and he knows KinderGarten Physics tricks
"Does that actually works" Of course it does, schewpid
House burning Cam Casey: Does that actually work? *drinks bang* lets try out
*walks in* ahem I am Mr. Panda allow me to explain. Fire is a reaction that requires a few things to keep going. The most important part is oxygen. So if a flame is placed in a sealed container it consumes the oxygen. This creates a change in air pressure with less oxygen on the inside more from the outside comes rushing in to fill the space creating a vacuum.   Now sealed in the bottle the flame will continue to burn until there is no oxygen left or The the strength of the vacuum is greater than the seal. So the vacuum is stronger the the soft egg and the egg gets sucked in.   Welp that end my interruption *walks away* remember science is fun and always question how things work!
Well, imagine that the boiled egg is soft
Thanos
Its called fire and it needs o2 to survive      Did they not go to school?
What the fuck. “Does this actually work?” Is he dumb? Has he never been to second grade
Nice drink advert🙄
Fuck, they're learning!
It’s called vacuum when u light the fire n put the egg on top the fire burns the oxygen in the bottle which crates vacuum
It’s fucking annoying that these shits thought school was lame yet …. 10 -15 later they are  all like “ ohhhh shit science “ congrats on being 10 years behind the rest of us …
Those 2 are the next EINSTEIN AND NEWTON
When the newspaper lid is on fire
That was a shameful attempt at subtle advertising 😂😂
Man: *gets COVID* Cam Casey: Does that actually work
They don't know what vaccum is
It would have fit without the paper on fire as it slide in the bottle with it having big opening. All that just to plug your sponsor!
👏👏👏👏 you have now learned the law of pressure. These TikTokers are pretty dumb
Cringe
Good job
Shit the tiktokers are learning too quickly, soon they'll figure out how to swim and then when that happens we're all doomed.
*Man jumps from 100 story building and dies* This guy:  does that actually work? Lets find out
I like how you can just steal a video and remake it right after
Wow it wasn't even hard boiled
Have u ever been at school? Lmfao
The kid who said “let’s find out” is the type of kid nobody wanted to hang out with because he did all the weird shit
I did this as a project in second grade and well it was cool
Is the soda can a commercial ? Like product placement because other than that Wtf is this video ?
Shouldn’t you know this before you year 4 at school?
Good learning something from being a human.. awesome
I guess people just love to skip 5 th grade
Is it 2008?
Vacuum
It actually didnt work his egg did not blow
Who remembers Professor Sumner Miller ?
Still not buying bang
What a waste of boiled eggs... These rich brats I tell you.
Embrace yourself because next generation is fucked!
So..... what are you gonna do with it now?
Bang be getting around 😂🤷‍♂️
Fire glob blob oxigen, so weak egg go brrr
Ok
Oh hey its my 4th grade sciencefair project.
He shamelessly took the idea and put a bang ad on it hahah
Humans are evolving. Just backwards tho
Greg we all knew about it way before tik tok  be creative or stop bro
I did this at school as a project lol
Tiktokers think we are dum
How to get the egg back outside?
I am sure he never went to school
Someone: kills him self This guy: does that actually works?
These advertisement are getting boring and too much
Mom: Where is my egg ?
May komontra.
this is just middle school science but sponsored by bang
"Shoots someone in the head with a 50 caliber sniper rifle"  Him:does that actually work?
It was bad enough when he made videos alone. Now he brings another drop out along. Please stop showing up on my feed
Tiktokers dont deserve to be youtubers
If U Put Ur Face Close To Turned On Tv U Will 50% Go Bind. Does that actually work? let's find out.
Tell me you didnt went to school without telling me you didnt went to school
This is dumb YouTube I want to watch actual science like NileRed
Hmm someone is killing his mom This guy: does that actually work??
These comments didnt let me down
Guys key lime pie bang is the worst tasting pne
I am so confused why do people keep copying others people's work 🤨
Please believe in Jesus before it’s too late he died on the cross for our sins he loves her so much Do you want us to come to him in the pen from our sins you have a choice to believe him or not amen
-13 iq plays right here
Notice how he said a newspaper and he used a napkin. This is how fucked up 20 year olds are now
poor egg
The anunnaki were from mars
yeah, heat expands things
What are you.. kid!?
This is old…like 1800 type of old
Put down the bang and slowly walk away...
That’s just a wast of food. I’m disappointed in my generation 😔😔
why in the world did he even bother doing this I thin we all know how pressure works well everyone but him clearly 🤣
That is why you stay in school....
If you stay underwater long enough you will drown!  Him: Does that actually work? Lets Find out!
Okay so lesson learned kids: DO NOT DRINK BANG ENERGY
The TikTok generation are freaking Einsteins! 👏👏
this is what happens when you sleep in science class
When you dropped out of school.
Yes we get it bang is your sponsor
So this is how you use knife and stabbing posture your opponent will get stabbed right there  A: 👁👄👁 is that actually worked??
Me: Smoking kills  Him: does that actually work?
*Sees basic science* This dude: dOeS tHaT aCtUaLlY wOrK???  I literally just- cannot stand Tik Tokers
gay lusaks law
How rae u going to get that egg out without breaking the bottle
How is this still going viral???
I just feel pathetic
Lu sekolah gak Sih kan d ajarin pas waktu sd??
Is that a blunt?
How is this a surprise, any gimmick for views!!
this isnt 2nd grade physics? you don’t even learn physics in 2nd grade? I’m in the 9th and I didn’t even know this, yeah this is cringe but wtf?
I swear, cavemen would never have invented stone tools if they had known this would evolve ...
Ofcourse it actually works. When i was at grade 6,7 this was there at every science exhibition.
Yo not to sound like an old lady, but what ARE they teaching kids in school? Bc I was in first grade when we learned about this. Can't wait for them to learn about the potato and lightbulb
I genuinely don't get what people are ragging on them for. I didn't know that shit till just now and I'm in 11th grade. you lot have to realize some people didn't get the same level/style of education as you
**simple physics** This man: No shot that works
He forgot to say sponsored by bang
Apperantly yall didn't watch uncle Joey do this...
Wow slow learners at their best
:Man jumps out of plane with no parachute Cam: Does that actually work?
Just for clarity: this isn't basic physics. This is 5th grade science. The fire is burning the oxygen which is creating a vacuum which sucks the air from the egg and outside the bottle in so the egg gets sucked in. I don't understand why this is so amazing to them. My head hurts.
Yes it is true cuz the fire inside the bottle like has an air inside that needs to go out the bottle so the the air jjst got through the egg and ye I just found it on the television about science and adventure and stuff
Getting demonitized on YouTube wait does that actually work let’s find out?
when you miss class too much
i hate you
Gg
It literally just screams “Look at the Bang…”  “LOOK AT IT!!!”  “LOOK AT THE DEFINITELY NOT SPONSORED DRINK!!!”
Basic physics- SPONSORED BY BANG ENERGY
Who needs school when you have tiktok.. right? Right?m
I learned this in seventh grade
I definitely didn't notice the bang
This is meaningless
Anyone else learn this trick from that one Full House episode?
I learned that from full house
Pailag wa naminaw sa klase
For a like they destroy 2 egg
Did he attend any science classes
Haha, I did that when I was 5️⃣ 🤣
I mean hey at least they're doing actual scientific stuff instead of those stupid challenges.
That is amazing
Why is one tooth of his brighter than the other? Stop with the “let’s see if it works” and hit a dentist
The trick is to add calcium to the egg in the bottle and rebuild hard egg shell
Unsubscribed.
I wonder who sponsored this video 🤔
People keep saying it's physics. No, no it isn't.
Please, move from "Does this actually work?" to "Why does this work" EVOLVE TIKTOKER BRAIN
What happens when you stare at your phone during physics class
we did that in 4th grade for science
Man the youth is stupid
They learning
🤣🤣
All I see are these corny ass jokes about him saying does this actually work. Like either enjoy the fucking video or go on about your day.
*How to kill ur dad*   Him: *does that actually work let's find out*
There is less *AIR* 💨 in the jar when it is *HOT* 🥵 than when it is *COLD* 🥶 but the pressure inside remains the same and when the lid is covered the jar is closed which means it *RUNS* 🏃🏽out of oxygen and space which creates a Suction/Vacuum only when the jar *COOLS* 😎  off the pressure decreases
Ever heard the term… vacuum chamber?  Atmospheric pressure?  Physics and chemistry?
Why are the eggs so mangled how about you do a video about learning how to hard-boil and peel and egg
The real question is how would get the egg out now?
Now I got it how indian tiktokers are learning new things
Daal toh dinaa abb nikal ke dikhaa
Dude THE NOSE OF THE BOTTLE IS LITERALLY BIGGER THAN THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF DAT EGGGGGGGGG
Wow, earth science.   Now watch me be amazed by a siphon
How bored could you be to figure this out
the answer is preasure(:
Yes because that’s how science and physics work
I can't believe this I went to school to learn this when I could've learn it off Tik-Tok.
Nobody cares about your bang energy 😤🤜
All you need is the match. Doesn't anyone remember the episode of full house when uncle Joey did the same  experiment in Michelle's class?? #90'sKidd
The only problem is....can they get it out?
"When you die, you will be dead!"  Tiktokers: "dOeS tHaT AcTuAlLy WoRk?"
pretty sure a 4 year old would know this
:him as a baby does that actually work? :mom OMG OMG MY BABY SPEAKED wait is that normal?
No I will not be buying Bang energy
I starting to think he's dumb
2nd grade physics LOL DUMBO
A random guy : okay i jumped from 20th floor , i feel nothing just the heavens gate were opened  Cam : DOES THAT ACTUALLY WORK ??😌😌
Anybody Same with me?, never installed and play tiktok?
Now how are you supposed to eat the egg why why do such a thing
This is definitely a bang advertisement lol
Tiktok sxxt
When the American education system is so bad, that teenagers learn 2nd grade physics on tiktoc.
That happens because the fire is burning the oxygen, and the egg is closing the bottle off, so it forms a vacuum place, so the egg just sucks in the bottle
now kids this is called poor product placement
“Shoots himself” Him: does that actually work?
If anyone needs an explanation  Fire produces smoke which sucks up air The air is on the outside of the bottle The hole is blocked by the egg Egg go inside  If you needed it bro learn some science
Didn't anyone else do this shit in science class back in 6th grade?
Im form 1 secondary school and i have this experiment in my ingredient science lesson
I feel like even anyone who didn't learn this in school could figure out how it works
This is just soooo sad 😢
I like how he sounds like a music teacher talking in synchopation while teaching you sychopation.
"Don't swim while it's raining you could get hit by lightning"  Him: "Does that actually work?"
Tell me you are sponsored by bang without telling me you are sponsored by bang
Youre watching a Bang commercial btw.  Also, bangs taste bad
Uh how are u gonna get the egg out
This is basic physics
s u c c  yes basics
Can u just shove the eggs in?
fake egg
This guys been under a rock
This dude asks if something "actually works" when his channel is so fake
Evolving. just backwards
Go to school kid. This what happend  when you dont eat your vegetable and go to school
Actually you don't need fire
당연한ㄱ..ㅓ..
we need Noah's Ark 2: Flodding Boogaloo
I don’t really care bout the experiment, but why the first guy speakin like dat tho lmao.
This is a straight lie.
Get a job mate
Professor Proton would be proud....said sarcastically
No it doesn’t work. It was an animation of a human made so realistic you couldn’t tell it was cgi.
**someone eats shit and pukes** 'wait does that actually work?'
the egg was already boiled . 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Stop drinking Bang, before you fucking keel over. Jfc. Every God damn video
Someone: *burns they’re self to death and says* “this is how you die!”  Him: does that actually work?
Ya seen Joey Gladstone on the " full house" sitcom pull this in the 90s, find a new trick dingle berry...o and love how the can of bang is ALWAYS squared up on camera like hmmm wonder how much they pay for that
Now take it out
That Barg drink he's drinking looks like it causes cancer in 48 states
Real question here is does his brain actually work??
https://youtube.com/shorts/up4nNPP1Xkg?feature=share
BANG WILL MAKE YOU DO THINGS LIKE THIS BELIEVE ME IM A TRUCK DRIVER
The sciences
I love how these people get millions of views for making a tiktok that is literally the same thing as the other tik tok except they are “testing to see if it works”
When the newspaper lit on fire in it
If you think that's cool then you should do some research of your own and learn why the egg is actually technically being pushed into the bottom from the outside and not sucked into the bottle from the vacuum created due to the lack of air. A vacuum doesn't necessarily mean a sucking motion its simply a space without or very little air 😉
If you don't understand how it work, basically The fire consume o2 in the bottle which makes it suck the egg
Fizzicks my friends... Cooler air has lower pressure therefore...
He is the only one I can’t trust whit these hacks
RiMiX is my name https://youtu.be/rGfXii3Hg8w
You learn this in like kindergarten also bang is disgusting
Nobody never told you not to play with your food
Is it just me or are these guys too old to be discovering this for the first time.
Person: *lights an entire forest on fire*  *Does that actually work?!*
Almost forgot to please my Bang overlords
Lady gets pregnant: This man : does dat actually work?
It’s pretty cool I did it in 4th grade for my science fair
Can someone explain it, please? I haven’t learned it yet and I’m curious.
“tell me ur sponsored by bang without telling me ur sponsored by bang.”
Just “bang” ad.
Supposed to use a raw egg tho lol
Congrats you are learning basic physics…
Simple physic idiots
I feel like I learned this in elementary school. What's incredibly sad is that people genuinely don't know why this happens.
Finally tiktokers are getting to kindergarten school
This man Fr being sponsored by bang 🤦‍♂️
The egg looks like it is already boiled
Scientist: Heart stops when you die  Him: Does this actually work? Let's find out!
Thanks for teaching us 2nd grade physics
"Man shots an kid and the kid dies" him: does that actually work? Lets find out

Did You Know?   Tiktok is school for people for become Dumb And Cringe
Americans are something else
Didn't you study FUCKING PHYISICS in your school?
You now you cloud just litertly push the egg but aim not complainig
Hey guys Jesus loves you  He wants you to come as you are He died for your sins past,present,and future. He was buried then rose again on the third day so you can be saved,so that you can have the free gift of Salvation.If you want God in your life just seek Him truly put your faith in Him and accept Him as your Lord and savior.It is by God’s grace you can be saved❤️‼️💝🙌🏾🤍😚🔥 n
If you put something in the freezer it will be cold (him) Let’s find out
Herpdy friggin derp duude
That's why you stay in school instead of trying to make it on social media.
I'm so ashamed to say that I live in a generation like this.
Man is living in a nice house yet looks like a homeless tweaker that hasn't showered in years lmao 😂😂😂
Is you're tooth ACTUALLY crooked?
Bang ad
No need fire u idiots!just push the egg into the bottle...😒
DoEs ThAt AcTuAlLy WoRk    Proceeds to “show off” bang     Side note drinking bang doesn’t make you cool, showing it off is just cringe
*guy turns on car*  him: does that actually work?
Cam Casey who has -100iq DISCOVERS BASIC PHISICS AGAIN
Bro , try the fork, spoon and bottle trick where u try ti balance the two on a match stick
DoES tHaT aCCtuAlLy WoRK
Do we talk about the tweaker in the back?
👎😂😒😓😕😏😑👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
These comments make me mad
Damn not like you took the egg shell off
Bang energy really getting scammed that boy barely showed it on screen
It was boilef
Jokes aside i HATE that hes advertising the drink in every video not even telling us it's a sponsor or something.
Ya'll actually got to do this stuff in school? I didnt go to a poor place and we never did anything cool in elementary or middle. Once i got to highschool and took chemistry though that was pretty cool. Made a "gold" penny
Hmmm, something tells me he likes bang energy
physics...
the egg wouldve fallen in anyway because the hole is too big for it to not fall
Wow i hate it
Thats logical. The fire is just trying to get air down and it pulls the egg in.
Me who can just push an egg into a bottle without needing to do this: 😎
I'm very worried that YouTube is slowly transforming into a degenerate tiktok cringe platform please help spread the word
Now how do u get it out
How to be rich on tiktok on 2 step : copy the video and just say " its dat actually work" and boom ur rich
When you skip school:
"Stick it in the tube"
This drink make him look like drug addict, lay of that stuff.
What a waste
this is his excuse for stealing content “does that actually work” clearly you just saw that it actually worked you idiot
it just slipped in—
I only watch for the lets find out guy with the glasses hes lit
Smooth marketing didnt even notice why u emphasise so much on that drink can
Was the first kid singing?
When you don’t know physics
"Staring at a lamp can hurt your eyes Him: does that actually work? Lets find out
That great but how do you get is out🤔😑
I dont know but maybe hé is trying to get a sponsor for bang energy
Domt waste food
That's why Education is Important
For every tik tokers here who doesn't understand basic physics, the fire need oxygen to burn and when it was in the bottle and the egg was on the top of it it blocked the air from getting inside the bottle and when the fire used all the oxygen the egg went down to fill the oxygen place (basically because there can't be a place without air on earth)
Now I know this guy is related to Dani
Why do stupid people have to try shit out then shocked when it actually works asking for a friend
Does your brain actually work
What is you gender: tiktoker
Guys I don’t think he’s sponsored be anyone
The bang drink is slowly turning him into Sid the sloth
Ane if u didn't realize, we're drinking bang! yes bang, the best drink u will ever drink buy it now
why is tiktok full of retards
instructions unclear: burned my house down
Who else notice it was already boiled
You can get it out the same way
How are you going to take it out?!!
If you paid attention in your physics class you would not be this surprised
When he said does that actually work I was like have you never watched diy sci
Fire consumes oxígen
He’s obviously trying to get sponsored by Bang
COMPRESSION
Fire absorbs the oxygen uses it as fuel which causes all the oxygen to be used up in the bottle which causes a vacuum that pulls the egg through
Calls a bottle a "tube"... discovers basic physics as an adult. Stupidity is sponsored by bang soda.
Wow the egg is already cooked lmao
The product placement 💀
#DefinitelyNotAnAdForBang 😩💖
Try this experience: Put a raw egg in a bowl and cover it with vinegar. It will start bubbling, as vinegar dissolves the calcium from egg shell. It will become a soft shell egg, as found inside chicken. Use the sucction trick as in y video to put the soft shell egg inside the bottle. (May use a cotton ball soaked in alchool). Rinse the bottle to clean it. Fill the bottle with lime water.  Leave for few days. Egg shell will reabsob calcium from lime. Rinse it again and will have a full hard shell egg inside the bottle. Mistery? No, pure chemistry!
Sponsored by bang
Legends know that this trick is from "Big Bang theory" 😎😎😎
I know how his works, but I wouldn't of thought of that  😂
80s and 90s kids looking at this like 🥱🤦‍♂️
I never knew this was possible, can someone explain this to me since they didn’t teach us jack about this.
It was on full house lol
Then what?... Why dont you just push the egg and it will going down
Ur so white
Dude u  did not use a hard boiled egg
Are we sponsored by bang
The man : if u cut your p, and put it back it will come longer Him : does that actually work lets try
Wow you created a vacuum.......I did that when I was six with my mouth and a bottle, not that hard.
EGG is already boiled
*let us seek refuge in the name of the father, son and the holy spirit; and may we be forgiven for being lost.*
Dudes learn nothing in school, and it shows.
We call that physic the fire needs oxygen so try to vacuum some oxygen to bottle bot there is an egg so it vacuums egg in the bottle and boiled egg is not a hard matter so it just goes into the bottle
Yeah, this guy didn't have science classes
Everyday I open the internet I realize people my age are learning shit I learned as a toddler, in adulthood
The paper from the original looks identically like a joint kinda sus
Seriously I've seen this shit years ago u ticktokers are way behind
"Does this actually work".....Are you sure you graduated?
What a bunch of fame seeking morons !🤦🏻
Random person: if you use a chainsaw on your arm your arm will be cut off  Him: does that actually work let’s find out
Waste of food
It just SiEnCe
The bang can write there annoying asl considering we know that wannabe sly shit
Just because it's basic doesn't mean that everyone has learned it and it doesn't make them stupid if they don't know about it. They are only stupid if they can't understand it once they have learned it.                                      - Me
Can these guys get a joke?
See someone dies him dose that work
Then how to make egg out from bottle u should give that trick too.
I remember learning this when I was 5 at the science museum 😐
Or just apply pressure too the top of the egg and it falls it, because it’s literally a hard boiled egg? And it wouldn’t have ashes on it? Oh wait, this is a Tik toker
Okay WEST stop selling weapons all around the world and start teaching your kids.....i mean seriously....is that really he didn't knew... 😂....my nephew knows it....and he is 11  I mean this is the Worst you could do with the egg...just wasted it.... 😂
How's he gonna get it out
bunch of morons who didn’t pay attention in any science classes now doing these “cool” things online.
Tell me you’re sponsored by bang without telling me you’re sponsored by bang
U bang sell out
Does cutting your hair with a weed wacker work let’s try
This is a clear case of home schooling and getting your education on tic tok poor guy and the other kid is actually dumber then he is you’d almost think that’s impossible to be stupider
Sun explodes This guy: does that actually work.lets find out
This idiot actually makes these videos and people watch does that actually work when you just seen it work.. good job people.
I'm tired of you people I wanna go on Mars
The real question is..  How can we take the egg back? If we don't take it back it will rot
I remember Ren and Stimpy: “I’ll teach you how to suck an egg!”
Iv never wanted to just grab someone amd smash there face in just for nothing but now I do
*slow applause* 👏👏
Do these people not go to school? Like these were taught to us at like 6th grade or something
are these actually stupid ? or they dint go to school??
那你是没见过我们中国的拔火罐
Omg!!!!! Is this 4 real 😲😲😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
SCIENCE 😁
Fuck does that actually work vids! Be fucking creative, this is cancer.
Why does his friend look high
This video makes me feel old, lol.
😱😱 wet the hel
person: *exists* this guys: does that actually work?
The guy with the glasses looks like a person that only has one friend.
I hope they know how it work, not only make video about it
😱😱😱😱😱
They're evolving dangerously fast, pretty soon they might learn basic algebra 😨
Who invited chicken little?
Wow he really likes bang probbaly not sponsored tho
I studied this theory during my school days
By 2034, tiktokers may even know what atoms are.
IDIOT TIKTOKERS
When TikTok discovers vacuum in 2021
It seems like, you dont have to starve.
You'll need an Anti Cringe 💊 to restore your  🧠 from swear damage.  Two will be given to one who's brain died watching this.
What annoys me most is that they pull a bang onto camera for no reason and force everybody to see it
This guy look like a Spearow
Very good job buddy! now next video let’s learn about how a baking soda volcano works!!
Wow
Skip school more and be shocked everyday.
Life surprises you everyday when you don't go to school.
Wont the bottle burst because of the heat ?
Creates a vacuum because the fire is looking for oxygen and sucks the egg
Bruh did you not know that fire needs oxygen. And thats why you dont skip school kids
한국 초5 기초 교육과정
No one: This dude: “iT AcTuALly woRkeD🥴🥴”
Congratulations, you have made it to the 3rd standard.
If there was no internet this new generation would go nuts
Geez, they are really super late boomers. I seen that in elementary school. What are they teaching you guys now...
The egg just relly fits
Aren't they too old to not know this works?! 😕
“When the newspaper lit is on fire” grammar 100
Now how do u get it out
“Someone robing a bank”  “Him” dose that actually work let’s find out
Does this guy not know that  vacuum exists
you can crack a skull open to see a brain.  him: DOES THAT ACTUALLY WORK?
Now eat the egg 🥚, more than 40% of food is wasted in America 🇺🇸🤭😢
"will it actually work?"  what a moron you have to be if you really need to ask that at his age....
I did this in 6th grade for science
Content...
Trick from 2015
Holy moly where’s the circus
He was singing  Him : does that really work
Now get it out of the bottle.
🙄🙄🙄
Nobody:  Absolutely nobody:  Bang energy:hey I sponsor
Now how you are gonna take that out of the bottle ?😀
'Lets find out' 😎
Did you even go to school?
In case you didn’t know fire creates suction
you're done man if my Gym bros find out about wasting eggs......
Pretend you didn't see that bang sponsor shit
Lmao I did this for a science fair in like 3rd grade
This is when you miss all your science classes and make tiktok all day
It works because fire needs oxygen or it cant be fire so what’s happened is the fire trying to get oxygen but the bottle didnt have enough of oxygen so it sucks oxygen from out of the bottle but the egg blocked it so it sucked the egg instead            SCIENCE BISH
Yaar yeh sab me 2 standard me Kiya krta tha
Use me as dislike button
If you put an egg in vinegar with the shell still on for 24 hours it’ll be soft enough to fit through the bottle just make sure to pay it dry with a paper towel
Anh now the question is how to take the egg out
plot: this dude is actually an idiot🙄
No matter how many times this kid shows that soda can in his videos, I bet no one has gone to get it lol
Physic
Working hard for that bang sponsorship huh?😒
Your bottle head is big for the egg tho 😂 even if the fire's not lit below. It would still slide in..
Is he the new bryce Hall?
Oi
If u light urself in fire you will die  Him:does that actually work
2 grade physicsssssss guys😑
Got ADed....
Greeeeat, you found out about vacuum...
hmmm
,
hmmm
But why?
Damn, now I have no doubts that you failed in school.
What is this bang he is drinking
What about the drink showing up in every video...??
You can just push it in.
He not steal or being dumb he just show us if it works so we cant give the other fake dumb vid views and instead we dont make that dumb other yt fazmous so thzts why hz shows if the tricks works znd then when its wrong and fake we dont need to watch other yt
Bro that is science
Bunch of idiots on earth be like
Wow, tiktokers evolving their brains into kindergarten pyshics
It's not a napkin it's a tissue
Someone cutting their hand off.  Him: Hmm does that actually work?
The legendary question “does that actually work”
I think the egg is already boiled
Let me explain, I’m 12, as we know to exhibit fire we require a fuel, oxygen and heat. We will mainly focus on oxygen. As it uses up its fuel it also use up the oxygen creating carbon dioxide/monoxide and water. As more oxygen is used up it creates a vacuum like in space as it has no oxygen and sucks in on itself. In this case there is an opening in the bottle that is being covered by the egg, it then sucks in the egg and gets it’s needed oxygen :)
When tiktoker's be advertising.
I think everyone was learning that in the 2nd grade😄
“Watch what will happen to the hard boiled egg when the newspaper lit is on fire in the…  … the egg is in the bottle!”
Boiled the eeg take off the shell wala
I can do the same with my mouth
"the man jumps of the mountain and flies"  Him: does that actually work?
You could literally drop the egg in that bottle
"does that actually work?"  AKA  I will copy your video
It's called diffence in pressure idiots... The moment he said does it actually work, I felt vomiting... Yuccckkk
This dude still someone content and still get millions of views
Fact - if u look closely egg is already boiled
He looks like he is high on speed.
How will u guys get it out
Who's the first guy, seen him in a couple of vids now
Bruh u need oxygen for fire so no shit
Basic physics
How this works is the oxygen inside the bottle is burning and the egg is blocking the Air way so the Fire well not the Fire but I cant remember what is it call but it's Sucking the Egg inside
This just proves that most of the people who use TikTok are slightly below iq rats with little hands to scroll through their Chinese toy phones.
Why do u sound like ur talking through ur nose
aku dr dulu sedut bisul pakai method tu
Y’all never had a kids science DIY booklet as a kid and it shows.
"Someone crying"  Him:does this actually work,lets find out
Tiktokers: does that actually work Rest of the world: does ur brain actually work 🙂
dont do that if the tissue falls on the floor youll start a fire in your house and im telling you fire spreads fast both in real life and minecraft (srry i just had to say it xD) and you wont be able to get water and than get rid of it in time
Bruh this is easy. I did this experiment when i was 9 years old at school.
Me watching the guy do a key stage 2 sicence experiment. Video then Immediately cutting to another guy whom says "does that actually work!?".   Me: ohhh your so fking dumb. Jesus Christ!  Tiktok is basically a platform full of idiots exposing themselves.
It works because fire needs air and the egg blocks the air and that make the egg got sucked. Scince is cool
Wow and i thought i was dumb
Thermodynamics taught to you at the age of 12 yet apparently no one fucking remembers
Hes trying so hard to advertise that water
am i the only 1 getting markian vibe from him?
"If you put out water with soup on your stairs then go down blind folded you can't fall"  "Dose this actually work?"
*nice boiled egg very soft•••*
How qbout dont waste food
Video guy- throwing a baby from a building kills it This guy- wait does that actually works? Let find out
I think this dude never studied science
Wow... *you just wasted a perfectly good hard boiled egg... congratulations...* 👏
I mean,you dnt lern it form school ??
If idiots would fly then tik tok would be an airport... Anssh Desai said this
Its because oxygen
"The man pretend to be blind to get money"  Him: does this actually work? Let's find out
I used to do this when I was in standard 2 🥱
Full house taught me this in the 90's.
These people didn’t went to the school I guess.
Is fack
Why bang energy why just why I hate u now
tube?
Yea but it didn't pop it
How could you fake that
This is autistic.
Lmao, done this in primary school back in the early 80's, I was about 8 years old, damn this generation is so  dumb... Well not all but most... 🤣🤣
This happened when u dont go to school and do drugs rather
2nd grade physics dude
Tik tok has officially been taking over youtube
A random guy: *kills him self  This guy: does this actually work? Let’s find out!
The does it work guy advertises for bang😂
that was boild egg  so it goes normanly
Definitely “subtle” sponsor.
The egg had no shell
when you skip physics class
Tiktok is a cancer on society, but at least it got people interested in science again.
That is Boili egg
waste of food.. as usual with tik tok
Wow, tiktokers are learning basic physics now
Mate. If you got so much interest in this shit, then why didn't you study it in school as passionately as you do on tiktok. Ffs man. You're living under a rock
so no ones gonna talk thats he not drinking?
I learn this trick from the science comic
Vaccume
By the way..good advertising..,,not,,
Tiktokers are evolving, they're starting to learn 2nd grade science.
Oof
Me wondering how he will get the egg out of the bottle without ruining bottle: 👁️👄👁️
WATCH what happens when 2 girls meet 1 cup. Search 2 girls 1 cup. It's 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oh look! It's young asmongold
Yeah definitely not another bang ad...
I learned this on Full House back when I was a wee one.
I more repeated video then will gonna unsubscribe
Someone :breathes Him: does this actually work?
*sees something that clearly isn't fake* "does that acktually work"
Yes, because the fire and smoke kills the oxygen and causing a difference in the pressure inside the bottle and outside it, which will at the end create a vacuum and lead the egg to be sucked inside the bottle
Why tf do you keep reposting videos
This is just a frickin reupload! Shame on you cam Casey!
