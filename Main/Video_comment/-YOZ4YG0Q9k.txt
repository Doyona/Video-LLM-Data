I Can’t Believe They Shot Our Dawg 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺
i cliam no bad energy from this takeoff video
Rip takeoff bro that's fucked up I wish I was there🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
He was killed on 11/1. Watch the video "Messy" and look what happens at the 1:11 mark. At the 2:42 mark he is standing next to R.I.P. The Illuminti always "signs" a sacrifice in their spiritual language.
😮👍
*TOM SHUO.* ------- ESTE PEDOFILO. ACOSA AQUI DENUNCIADO. POR PEDERASTIA. FIN.
GRACIAS FOX 5 LIKE.
TELELULA RTVE MIENTE SIEMPRE DENUNCIADA.
We are the salt of the earth God talks about but we are killing each other because of nothing
This is nothing new. I remember when Sam Cooke got killed, Marvin Gaye also. And Notorious B.I.G.
Over a dice game right?
BS story "shooting dice in alley" right that sounds truthful worth millions but shooting dice in alley ok
Must have been those Dark Skinned "white supremacists "
Clearly rap a lot records have the police on payroll, how this j Prince jr have two dice games , at each dice game there’s a killing, and no arrests?? Houston PD needs a internal affair investigation!
Dis is crazy he never bothered nobody
Sad😭
Black violence is a national security threat..ya don't see country music stars getting shot
Sometimes you just have to look in the mirror and ask yourself what's going on.
He made shitty mumble rap
🎳🎳🎳strike ~out
🛫 Takeoff 🛫🕳️🔥  R.I.T
Nobody even cares , this is a normal thing at this point in hip hop💯
Just sad. May God comfort his family .
DEAR LORD PLEASE COMFORT THE BEREAVED! IN THE NAME OF JESUS! 🙏
We all gotta takeoff sometime 🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅😅
THIS IS THE DAMAGE THE KANYE IS TALKING ABOUT FROM THE MUSIC LABELS,  THEY ARE PAYING IS TO MAKE NEGATIVE MUSIC TO KILL OURSELVES   NO OTHER RACE IS DOING THIS !!!!!!
Never heard of him. Everyone is a rapper 😂
I seriously don't understand why there aren't protests?
Everyone speaking on puke ... takeoff was an actor and informant ... same as the migos offset a high level informant same for quarvo... The meet-up with a real one an they run that mouth an attacked him together as a group ... He upped the iron an laid em down like any mtf would an totally justified too ... People need to get real an quit believing the hype an lies ... Migos known around for being loud an stupid , an ready to talk tough an attack on whim ... Also known to be packing heat an gang bangers .. play stupid games an talk tough an attack an win lead prizes step right up ...
This is so sad why is every rapper getting shot killed😢
A Rapper that doesn’t even preach violence towards the community. Just seemed like a great guy. RIP
My favorite one in the group. This cat was cool as hell.
I don’t get why people shoot rappers, and not politicians
Spot life too dead life. Rip
That's the life he chose so it's not shocking at all..🤤
Wtf when
Rest in piece our young brother we clearl love you and we gonna miss you lots ,living tears aside lets pray that your soul gains towards the second given life for those who believe life after death this is the second chance given to a soul to live entirely .RIP
The music industry ain't nothing but a setup unless you do independent music on your own work schedule with protection everywhere you go, don't expect anyone in your circle to give you a heads-up when danger approaches
A guy that make a living off the back of gangs and violence meets a violent end……no real surprise there .
White privilege? Patriarchy? Colonial racism? No, just black on black violence. In the UK it would be the Mets Operation Trident team investigating....
Great officer, great information, neutral grounds. Respect to him! More like him, thank you.
BLM Stupide peuple
Self induced genocide.  Get it together.
God bless 🙏
Wheres BLM on this??? Thought yal cared
I love the Migos, I'm really sad that Takeoff has been killed so young amongst so many young people and no one so anything of significance.
youtube.com/@realchipodnoo rip
This is why I don't go nowhere. Even if I were a celebrity I definitely wouldn't.
Dam this shit is real.
I’m being secretly Illuminati harassed in D.C.
RIP amigos group member Take off…dang! Not another musician the Illuminati have killed off…
Drinking, gambling, arguing and some dude gets shot. Who would have thought that could happen ?
Call him Takedown now.
Senseless 💔
When small kids get killed due to violence what you expect for a grown man.. No one is safe.. RIP condolences to his family
Who?????
What’s the point of every news channel reporting the same shit like how do these new companies all exist I don’t get it
💔💔💔
Rest in peace, Takeoff.
Rappers are the most controversial artist in the music industry, the lyrics merge imagination into reality, in many ways its a curse and a gift. To often rappers lose their life's this way.  Rip Take off
With no other genre of music do you hear BS like this happening and promoting negativity or violence. Even if the artist doesn't promote such thing, they're surrounded by such BS.
Niggas gotta stop killing niggas mahn😕
Two migos are left, the other took off.
So was he purposely shot or just got hit
Fuck em
Hip hop is wack AF! This shit doesn’t happen with rock stars & country singers. A BLACK MAN’S #1 ENEMY IS ANOTHER BLACK MAN!!!
Who gives a fk
Many do not like the genre of Rap music because of its frequent use of vulgarity. It is not so much the genre that is the problem as it is the rappers themselves who are the problem, and who make use of vulgar language in their songs. This demotes their image. I was trained as a child not to speak vulgar language, and once when I did, my mother rushed me into the bathroom and washed out my mouth with a bar of soap.
Supposed to be a private party??!! Sudden death seems to be an occupational hazard in the rap game.
🇯🇲Jah Jah😱😱 ... were is the ( Security ) R.I.P Take off no joke
Love u
Quavo the one that got him killed takeoff was just chilling when a dispute between quavo and the other nigga shooting dice with him shots start popping off takeoff gets shot and dies..shit needs to change why they gotta go shoot dice when they have millions go link up with other millionaires not with fucking bums with no life
HE WAS A SACRIFICE FOR RITUAL . MAKES SENSE HOW IS THE LEAST POPULAR MIGO. AND HOW NON  OF HES GOONS HAD HES BACK.
Sacrifice
R.i.p..a sheep dressed like a wolf in this rapping world of violence 😢...God bless his soul
What a surprise
OMG every time I see this dumb 💩 I have to laugh. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Imagine dying over a dice game. 🎲 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nobody saw the shooting, what a big surprise that is.
What is wrong with the 🌎 where this becomes the norm????Prayers to that man's family R.I.P  🙏
This makes me feel sick because he wasn't even violent or in that kind of lifestyle.
Playing dice..smdh the worst game to play. No millionaires should be in a place like that and they damn sure shouldn't be playing dice..
R.i.p and so many other rappers not safe to be a rapper even though this was a gambling situation still awful life of a person so much shooting its crazy God help the people affected this got to stop
This is what happens to criminals. They get shot by other criminals. You should all get an education and stop idolizing clowns.
Aw hell nah. Who would do this?
Aren't all black people rappers!
A rapper being shot, what a shocker.  The lack of common decency and manners these days, acting like a bunch of thugs and criminals.
oh hell yea ..  thug it  thug it up ..
Don't like rappers
Damn Dawgs smh
And this is why im a home body and dont socialize outside my family circle. The guys got shot at a damn bowling alley. Sick ass people out there
ban guns
There is no peace in democrat cities.
Migos back together 🙏
Who's Takeoff?   Never heard of him.
What does BLM have to say about this ??
Rest in peace
. What goes around, comes around. .
Migos will not be the same after this, especially Quavo. RIP Takeoff 🖤
imma takeoff houston off the map
when they put it on the news and say who was there...that's confirmation that the job was done....pay attention children.. sacrifices will always be made...
is he Tookoff now?
The Migos member nobody knew.
I just heard Takeoff’s solo music recently. It’s fire and interesting.  His talents will be missed. Damn, this is so sad.
Dude should have take off when he had a chance
The coast is clear.
LOL who the hell is this guy? LOL
I saw the raw video. looks like Quavo got in a fight and Takeoff was trying to defend/help him then the shots start to fire. A fist was thrown. takeoff seemed silent the whole time Quavo was arguing
I am a 63 year old man, and a fan of the Migos!!!!…no judgment calls here, no pointing fingers!..but my prayers go out to the family of Take Off!!!..rest in paradise young Prince!!!!!!
Rip
So take off was took out
RIP 🪦

Gotta find the white supremacist shooter.
Rest in piece
Me in Baytown tx like 😳
This shit hurt me the most because, takeoff was basically taking off on his personal career not as a group. Damn.
rip🙏🙏🙏🙏
who?
It"s just not getting any better...worse every day!
Next stop HELL 🔥
You live by the gun you die by the gun. They dont want GOD who is the answer. And this is why these things happen. GOD will be back soon. This type of cruelty cant continue to go on. MESSY it is.
This has to stop.!
Who?
Not surprised, this is common with black rappers.
Crazy world we in we all should be friends rip
Nñb
Damnnnn
Playing dice 🎲  😯😯
Shocking
Daam, there are some truly jealous & wicked suckers in this world. Deep condolences to Takeoff's family/friends. I pray his soul reaches the highest level of all, with God.   People of all ages, we must always be vigilant & wise to avoid the dangers that lurk amongst us all on this planet.
Why does a New York new channel feel the need to report this tho 😹😹, that’s weird asl rip takeoff
Go home. You got $25,000,000. You got nominated for a Grammy. You in the biggest rap group since Outkast. You got all that talent. 02:30am - GO HOME!!! Why you shooting craps? GO HOME!!!
So why didn't I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street? When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me? Hypocrite!
What the fuck........🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️. At the age of 28, being taken away out of life. You don't die young; you just lose your life. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 So many who who believe in you.... friends and families, others who are looking up to you as a model. Just a waist, so hard to accept. But done already.
Houston? As in Texas? You'd think that would be the safest place on earth with the Second Amendment and everybody and their mother owning a gun. So GUNS don't make it safer for anyone? So what is it Republicans always preach and their many denials? Lol So much for the Second Amendment argument! Time to abolish it.
R.I.P. Takeoff god’s got you in his hand now
😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Tupac- And still I see no changes!!
Rappers = one of the most possibly the most dangerous occupation in the country possibly the world
My condolences goes out to family and friends
Such names these people have these days . RiP Takedown and Quervo heart goes out to you as well Unk ! All these young folks had so much potential.  whats with this culture of death and hurting one another ? life is hard enough ?? Put these guns down people settle it with your fists and live to see another day
A rapper shot and killed?  Someone must have got disrespekted….
Whoever killed him . Hope rots in prison
This ish needs to stop!!!! I'm sick of these senseless killings!!!! Enough is enough!!!!
Well he took off In a hurry to hell lol    Born Lucifers Minions
Now he’s take off and not coming back
Sus where's the camera footage and the suspect
Still in denial about this death.
The Best Migo
Makes no sense. I'm all messed up now, this dude was great. Just like Pop he's gone too soon.
takeoff took off
R.I.P Takeoff 🕊
He lived life. Rest in heaven.
Not sure why everyone is surprised. More black on black violence. Clean up your dam community!
What kind of millionaire hangs around a dice game?
What’s a million dollar brotha doing shooting dice in front of a bowling alley what da?
RIP to that man. Lowkey had the best verses on some of their tracks.
My condolences
👀😨
😢😢😢
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🕊🕊🕊🕊😢😢😢
👀r.i.p
Shot in the head? That sounds like execution to me. No one saw the shooter ? Ummm this needs to be investigated further.
A bunch of rappers illegally gambling. What could go wrong?
Some just die, YouTube 7.4 people like this
this is very sad but when you are an artist of this caliber you cannot be out in the open like this, and playing dice in a public bowling or billiards. i mean you have to protect yourself especially how society is right now. condolences to the family
people will never understand that a bullet will go deep in your skin and though the brain or the intestines sometimes it will get stuck or go through the human being.
How dff do you make a joke and say fraction…… respectfully
Whoa
All musicians in their contracts these big contracts everything now goes to the label and the record company nothing to the family or friends so it's actuality in their best profit and interest when this happens they make out like a killing
It’s sad the other day I was wondering who’s next from the black celebrities we see on TV since they are the only ones dying at a fast rate
Rappers are among the highest among being victims of violence, Fox 5 just reported that fact
I'm not a fan of Migos, their music isn't my taste, but hearing that Takeoff was killed affected my mood this morning. I first heard about him and Migos back when I was in high school. From the few songs of theirs that I actually enjoyed and/or liked, he was almost always the best part of them.  R.I.P. Kirshnik Khari Ball (Takeoff) 😔 June 18, 1994 - November 1, 2022
My Heart aches for this young man, family and friends. And I'm DISGUSTED that some of my people, still haven't learned who the real enemy is! Rest in Power, young man!
NO. WAY…
My favourite verse was fifjsbsjfifndjsidjdnsjdifnfhsjskfofnekalapdpfltnskdofogktksosodofkrnakaodufifigjfbejsicifjrnqkaofofndnsidocndnsk what a writer he was
One less no talented rapper gone
This world is cruel and unfair 😞rest in peace takeoff I’ll always remember your fire music
Maybe he should of tookoff a little bit earlier
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
And I lost my homey to a funky ass dice game ~bun b
My teenage life just been shifted  Can’t even make music anymore this hit deep😪
The gangster rap culture of being hard AF but really soft like a old fucking tomato. Can’t throw hands so they do the pussy thing and somehow this culture glorifies it as being brave😉
R.i.p from the 305 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Well, it was a sacrafice and best believe rituals will be done over his death 🤷🏾‍♂️
NO🕊️ JUSTICE FOR TAKEOFF ❤️
Is this what defund the police looks like. RIP.
My condolences to the family
His real name is Kurishknect??? Wow that is a ancient name that means ," One that feeds off Vampires!"(Vampires killers). That's a cool name! 😎
I don’t how but almost a day ago I saw a guy talking about  both of them being dead on Instagram I thought it was fake since it wasn’t news still weird man. Seems like people are getting killed left and right for stupid reasons like this I don’t feel safe in America anymore
That's why you should REALLY accept Jesus. You never know when it's your time!
He was humble to be the youngest
another ''nigga moment'' fuck all these niggas resorting to guns over nothing
can black people stop killing each other when will this stop ???????? where’s blm ??????
Alright, guess nowadays if someone doesn't agree with you,  they or you must die.
His own team shot him in the back of the head, unfortunate. When you have a bunch of idiots with guns, this is what happens.
🙏
My favorite Migo is gone now smh damn!
Rip to half my childhood fr 💯💯
In Texas who would thought
This is sad‼️🙏🏻👑🕊️
I’m surprised we haven’t heard who the other two were that got shot
Dice? Why? Smh
I dont get it. You become a Millionaire after getting rich off music. Yet you hang out on the streets shooting dice like you are still poor. Why are you still hanging out with guys you used to hang out with when you were broke and desperate? Rappers don't appreciate the wealth they obtain. They still seek validation from other men to be accepted. When you have something to lose, that seeking of validation is gonna get you in trouble.
Owell.
Why are these shootings still going on? RIP Kirshnik Ball (Takeoff)
Over a game of dice , really.......wow!
"devastating loss"?
Blacks being Blacks.....
WTFuck
R.I.P
He tookoff
Never heard of him
Yall need security
HE GOT KILLED BY HIS OWN PEOPLE,PLUS HE WAS GOING TO GO INDEPENDEN IN HIS MUSIC CAREER
He just dropped an album with quavo recently too☹️
The only one with out gossip fucking that bitch twenty  he told quavo this why they were breaking up and they don’t break up because you die out but they got tired of being cardi abs offset side kicks knowing she starts shit and they was a group nowadays offset is follow her cardi b what about them and thete group  it’s like he just forgot them following her because she blew up abs there group didn’t I just got this feeling it’s sad how bitches come before your bros and it’s always doesn’t end well when these are third get involved
Charles Takeoff Barkley 🚀
Let me say this as a Black man. When you have the opportunity to better your life, the conditions of your family but you insist to keep doing N $, N $ will happen to you. This should have never happened. These guys have money and got way too comfortable with the locals. Someone is always looking to make a name for themselves. This is all stupid. Now his life and the lives of many will be negatively effected by this murder.
he really had to take off
Who knows, maybe in a few years these smart, talented, and educated rappers will have completely killed each other........
Died on lil peeps birthday
Died on lil peeps birthday
They killing all our people why you letting them do this putting you all against each other because of these hies
Wow the Irony is too much.
Police are looking for Joe Budden!
Wait..... what?.......1 of the Milo's got killed? Smh
All because of cardi I know it every since they got her in it’s been death with rappers or in prison I know because of them yelling offset fuckingbtweety abd there is messy
RIP Takeoff 🙏
Guns need to be banned. If you already own a gun they should give you two days to turn it in before they come and lock you up. I wish I was the president or the governor. I wouldn't stop fighting and raising holy hell to those guns are banned.
Who cares
Blacks ain't safe around blacks. We need to stop talking about racism as much as we hate ourselves 💯🤷🏾‍♂️
Oh my so sad rip
Dice games have always been the quickest way to end up dead out of every game in the hood.Why these guys still involve themselves in the street version of that game I don’t know. If you want to play dice go to a legit casino and do it.
Rip 😢 Takeoff
rest up takeoff damn bro
Never been a fan of Migos for real, but this is terrible. I'm pretty sure they never really talked about violence or anything in their music, just booze, bitches, and the likes, so this is very sad
Why do rappers have the corniest, lamest, weakest real names?
How can this bowling alley be the only place on planet earth that doesn't have a camera?
Sacrifice!!!! Somebody about to come up!  Offset can finally be free of Cardi B!
Hat off to the one who did it. He ain't so "G" now."Getting Money"  "Fuckin' other pussy niggas bitches" "now I got my head blown off"... LMAO 🤣
He got shot because of Cardi and offset
Dumb people will say it's the illuminati
the problem is in America they all seem to possess guns so easily especially texas.
Murder is an occupational hazard to those in the rap game.
Rap... it's not even about the music anymore.   I'll stick pantera and megadeth I think.   It's seen me through the hardest of times and kept me steadfast for the past 30+ years. No dissing, just prophetic messages about life itself.  Sad day for his family man. You rest easy bro. The struggle is over.
RIP in pieces
This timeline is trash
Who?
Always blacks killing blacks. Lol
Millionaires with family’s out playing dice at 2am losing their ass starting a fight losing that too then they start shooting 🔫 and they shoot their own homie
who cares about these rappers ? they live this life and do not care about anyone, even using false name.
J prince did it
Deepest sympathy to the victims family and pray that justice not vengeance is served rip takeoff.
Another one bites the dust,  how come no one is calling it out, that most rappers are killed by other blacks
Lol
Lastly, if you are a celebrity or someone with a family and a bright future.. clubbing a lot and rolling dice outside a closed nightclub isn’t a smart move. The truth is… you will never find a husband, a professional , a lawyer, a doctor or anyone with something to lose outside at those hours gambling.   So if you have a family and a life- don’t risk it putting yourself among people who have nothing to lose. I’m telling you-> no one of value is outside at 3am in the morning playing dice. And when you add alcohol to the mix people are further not in their right minds.
Believe me they have video of who did it and they will go to the booty house and smoke meat cigars
Nobody trying to talk. They know who did it.
Yo, shit was a robbery. Mf's were shooting dice. Money
Am ashamed of African Americans
John 3:16 Receive the free gift of salvation before it’s too late. This man was on earth one second and in another terrifying eternal world  the next.
Most men are feminine these days.. they get sensitive and emotional over arguments and start shooting. We are in the days the Bible spoke about where the heart of men become cold.   It’s best to be wise and seek peace always, because some people are insecure and foolish.. they look for opportunities to hurt people. Some gun owners have a criminal mentality where they purposely instigate arguments and extend arguments because they know they have a gun hidden in them. It’s a false sense of strength. That is straight cowardness.
My Condolences to his family. May his soul rest in perfect Peace.  Amen.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Guess killing rappers is like the tiktok challenge for psychopaths now
Dear Black People : Stop killin each other
Every rapper claims to be the ultimate badd ass.
This is sad the man really was the embodiment of cool...dude was so low key and laid back this gotta stop condolences to the family R.I.P KING
What a world to be rich and dead is hard to imagine
You have to say Rapper/Gangbanger - Nobody is just a Rapper!
Let me guess, killed by a white guy
Daaammmnnn! RIP! I loved Migos! Amazing rap group! They’ll never be the same.
Rest in peace young  there a heaven for a G
damn. he took off.
God will have the last laugh  fear the one who can kill the body and soul not the one who just can kill the body praying 🙏
The stars belong to the sky r.i.p.
Must stop the hate  but God will handle it 🙏
This is so upsetting I can't understand this I have been in tears my heart goes out to his family may he rest in peace 🕊️
When you get rich and you do good;  You make poor enemies that do bad! -by me.  May his soul rest. May his memories live on through family and friends.
Love you forever ❤️ pray 🙏
Rest in paradise young take off 😓
OMG they sacrificed him
lol
How much you wanna bet he was killed by another black man?
I’ll bet the shooter is a maga white supremist.         C’mon man         Hello. Goodnight
I can't be true :(
didn't die, this shit a script to continue getting rid of guns progressively
oh man no !!!!!!!
oh no....what will the world do without one of the  random  million rappers who promotes violence and degeneracy ?oh no
Just another unknown rapper killed in the deadliest city in the Nation. Shocking?

Romans 6:23  “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”  King James Version (KJV)
Nah u playin

Millionaires shooting dice on the street.  You deserve it.

Being a rapper seems like a death sentence these day smh.

I can't believe it!!!!!! Smfh R.I.P TAKEOFF I am truly sad 😔
I can’t believe this
Damn he was my favorite from the migos damn bro 😞
You live by the sword, you die by the sword playboy.
A symptom of the culture they’ve perpetuated
Damn. Can't even go anywhere, play some games & have fun anymore. I'm sure he didn't expect this to happen when he set foot into that bowling alley - he went for some recreation & gotta lose his fkng LIFE bcz some MF got mad over NOTHING
So Qua was there? He ran from bullets? You've got to be kidding me that that wack as posie a ss bi tch a ss mother ucker of an Uncle whos lived longer and currently breathing didn't do anything but run? I can die comfortably knowing my family is safe i guess not many real "G-Code" mfkres like me around anymore.. These kids nowadays is just a poor example of "Courage" formally known as heart aka balls aka umf aka cojones aka gull aka Male DNA
Brrroooo no wayyyy
The way the reporter said “feller” sounded hella racist 😅
They taking the wrong ones smh
im waiting for 6ix9ine to troll his death aswell 😂😂
RIP TAKEOFF!
R.i.p
It's always my favorite artist 1st Juice wrld, lil keed,young dolph,now takeoff.
People need to open their eyes.. takeoff didn’t just pass on Halloween night just over an altercation that ended with him getting shot. He was set up to be a ritual. A Pagan ritual called samhain which is literally what Halloween is. You offer sacrifices to the god of death also it begins around the fall so pagans wait for it all year. He also died at 2:30 am on Halloween night. This was a set up. He was sacrificed. We are going to see more of these artist pass away.
Why they playing dice, and they rich!!  Rip Takeoff
Guess he didn't TAKE OFF fast enough 🤭playing dice silly anyone from the block knows that game will get you popped
Please give real news.
So there was no cameras in the area they were at? 🤔
Never heard of him LOL 😂
R.I.P takeoff
Nice crap music.
Smh
🙏🤬
Idu y America allowed a guns in public, r they stupid or what?
When will these senseless crimes 🛑, this is so heartbreaking

Now if only cardi B could be next
Lots of people were there but nobody seen anything smh typical
Don't care

Another Sad Day For The Culture…I Dislike November,Look How Many Rappers The Culture Lost The Last Couple Of November’s‼️🤦🏾‍♂️💔🕊 #riptakeoff
Too bad it wasn’t Kevin gates or mgk screw rap get rid of em all
so did they catch the shooter? or did they manage to TAKEOFF...........
Rip
America, reaping what they sowed overseas,  no rest for the wicked, million killed in iraq,libya ,afghanistan syria and other places are crying for justice.
HAHAHAHAHA!
Why do all of these rappers keep getting shot and killed ?, my prayers go to Takeoff’s family 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾.
Being a millionaire why would you surround yourself with scum of the earth rip takeoff 🙏🕊💸
Who goes to a bowling alley and shoot dice,this was all a set up,a (SACRIFICE),and his uncle knew about it,the whole music Industry including (CARDI) they all knew
Damn
Sounds like a hit
Sad man
So sad 😞 😥
Why they saying it was a shooting if bro didn’t shoot back
No hope in Rap Music!  RIP Takeoff aka The Rocket!
Didn't his own crew shoot him by being reckless
Your heart hurts and you are sad? I’m not at all. Not because I lack sympathy but nothing good happens at that time and in that environment. Rock and country singers don’t get shot. Well maybe Kirk 🤔

Where in houston
Guess his career never really ‘took off’…. 🥸
Proof once again all the good ones be going 💔
Woah
Nah i always said this would happen since years ago migos always been trash and acted hard like barking dogs only this time they ran into real gangsters but it’s not fun now right 😂😂😂😂but it’s okay for pussy migos to jump one nerd alone to look hard right 😂😂I mean it’s sad and rip but I’m not surprised at all 🤷🏻‍♂️guys like migos always get killed where I’m from they just talk a lot and won’t fight one on one 😂
Lovemessy song takeoff took off on this song I loved this song the 1st time I heard it
Hiphop is the only genre that death follows..it's like a dark cloud is over it
Rip takeoff
I live in the US and I’ve never heard of him or of the group Migos. What a terrible way to day in a such way at a very young age. 🤷🏻‍♂️
R.I.P Takeoff
we need more guns
rest in peace liftoff
Dont come to Houston. My apartment was being robbed, I caught the dude, we shoot each other and nothing happened. No one was even arrested.
Illuminati Sacrifice???
Ppl are such cowards these days.Everyone wants to be gangsta's,but noone wants to knuckle up,just shoot ppl..It's f'N insane,I say ban all rap music 💯
Fake news
This is too sad. Rest in peace bro- you will have justice.
Notting will be missed from him...one less ..lmaoo
Blessings to the families.
Happy Halloween
Never know when we coming or when we'll go!!! R.I.P
All rappers do is help out the community ,help the kids and do good in society they never talk about shooting people,killing people,selling drugs or sliding on opps ,I don’t understand why such good group of people known as rappers are dying
Probably fake or not either way some kinda sacrifice 😅 I don’t trust shit I don’t see unless im there myself .
Life has no value anymore in America
Why even put yourself in that situation
I hate this It’s not fair 😢
Noooo 😭😭😭
I’m sorry 😞 to hear 👂🏾 this. I’m in Houston. RIP 🙏🏾🕊🤍
That's what happens when cowards are carrying guns. To scared to throw hands. My respect to the family and friends of Takeoff. May he rest in peace and greatness.
WTF is going on in Houston??!!! Didn’t King Von get killed in Houston as well??!!  I live in Dallas but stayed in Houston for a year and it was cool!!!
Rest in Peace Takeoff 🙏
Don't play dice at 2:30 in the morning at a Bowling Alley got it! 😎
Damn, shooting dice in front of a Closed bowling alley as a millionaire? I would be in barbados with a baddie and a mamosa. Wtf
Govt should ban guns for personal use.
Well at least he took off on his way to heaven. As one gone another born. Life goes on
Blood sacrifice and it was on Halloween
nothing good happens after 1 am
Don't be sad , faith love hope ,
Not surprised at this point and it’s going to get worse.
He disrespected someone for sure!
Blood sacrifice on Halloween
Well... figures, it was bound to happen
I guess he lived up to his name. Rip
Hi
Suge
It's your own kind killing each other,you don't fear the white man it's your own kind man.
You have made it. Why indulge in the same negative behavior? Leave the bullshit behind
Takeoff I’m the bird keeper make the bird fly
He probably thought he was in Atlanta.  Texas boys don't mess around.
Hope he is not in Hell... God doesn't want you to waste your time on this Life by flexing or by signing about drugs and sex.
WHERE WAS THEY SECURITY!!!!!
“The world is in more peril from those who tolerate evil or encourage evil than from those who actually commit it.” -Dr. Albert Einstein, March 30 1953
😢
It’s hard to believe that a culture of violence and death would lead to violence and his death….I’m just at a loss for words. Not really. He’s just another number in a long line of numbers. Maybe they’ll learn from this but I doubt it. Good luck with all that. Prayers to his family though. They’ll have to suffer through this.
Omg no dude. Wtf is this bullshit.
This is ridiculous.  Last people to realize blm is BLACK PEOPLE.  How can you kill TAKEOFF!!!!!!??? Like his murderer wasn't a fan, doubt one of the few black people who doesn't like rap is also a murderer.
THIS IS SAD!! HEART BREAKING. RIP TAKEOFF
RIP TakeOff💔
Man what.. R.I.P
Offset got to be feeling fked up for real
Damn!!!!!
🤯 Never really f with migos bar a few songs but this crazy R.I.P
This is a very sad for the hip hop world 🌎 and for the black communities.. RIP takeoff and may God blessed your soul 🙏 🙏🙏
RIP Takeoff
Tf men i still can,t Believe takeoff gone, Rip legend😣😣😭💔🕊
I hope Kanye isn’t next!
Walk away from this lifestyle. It's not worth it. It's over...
Shorty wanna be a thug
Fuckin pissed man

Sad
During a Dice game at a bowling alley smdh. Rip
Blm
so sad rip🙏
Who cares.. With the name takeoff he should’ve took off like should’ve ran took one to the head now he’s taking off to the next chapter in life or death…
This guy is a pussy..only tough with a gun. Cos he's a weak Man. Nobody needs to lose their lose their lives over a disagreement,  that's not gangster to us , so that killer needs to taught a hard painful lesson for nonsense.  You just don't do that.  Goofy not gangster at all..
RIP I am sick of all this killing.
That’s awful he was always minding his business and not bothering anyone. RIP young man
Got shot in alley playing dice tf ur rich why you still being ghetto
Who cares,that’s the lifestyle they choose.
Damn that's tough
This is insanity for christ sake America change your gun laws.
Rest in power TAKEOFF gone too soon.😔 blasting "STIRFRY" to your memory💐🙏🏽
Quavo sacrificed him
BACK IN THE DAY RAPPERS WOULD COLLABORATE WITH EACHOTHER NOW THESE RAPPERS ARE INTO THE EVIL SHIT THINKING ITS COOL TO WEAR THE UPSIDE CROSS AND KILL ANOTHER
I only know a little bit about rap, but of course I know Migos. This is awful. RIP and condolences to his family
Whoever brought the gun laws into the US was just a devil's agent. How many are we gonna loose until someone thinks of opposing the laws
Noooooooo why the fuk does this shit keep happening 😢just burn the world and start over because I'm so sick I people killing people 😒
Take off with a sacrifice and you wonder why offset left the group something got to do with quality control
It's a damn shame you can't have a dispute without it escalating to gunfire. Smh. What is wrong with this world!!???
Hug your loved ones don’t argue with your mom your spouse , forgive your father forgive him / her who did nothing but hurt you , you never know when’s the last time you get to see them. RIP man
When too many Blacks are gathered, it's best to beef up security.
Those black lives that matter 🏃🏿‍♂️ 😂... Clan lives matter.
How sad. So much tragedy. Sorry to the family. Another young artist taken from us. Prayers to the family.
ENERGY HARVESTING planted characters
Rip take off another one gone over something stupid
Them ppl from Houston don't be playing, they will let you have it. It's sad smh
He was the most quiet and chill in the group #MIP 🙏🏽
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💖❤❤❤
Sad to hear. But at that point you shouldn't be playing dice in public like your not famous.
One thing is for sure, we know the killer is not White.
Rest in Peace Takeoff 🙏 (1994-2022)
What does the truth of God's word in the Bible tell us? "What does it profit a human being if they gain the whole world then lose their soul? Is anything worth more than your soul?" Our soul is eternal like our spirit and it will go in eternity after we face God our creator for judgement. All human beings are born sinners and we all need to believe in the one and only saviour Jesus Christ for salvation.
Yikes…this is unbelievable.why does this keep happening? RIP Take off!😢
we need prayers everywhere.
That’s sad
Why you a millionaire and going back to the hood gambling with broke hood niggas who don’t give 2 fucks
Fuck was quavo doin, runnin?
This mess has to stop, WTF is wrong with our people.
Wonder if that snake Benjamin crump will make a press conference?
They sacrifice him
May that man rest in peace nothing good comes after 10:00 at night especially shooting dice in the Builder if you're that type of rapper and you have millions of dollars shoot dice at your house shoot dice in your backyard with your friends you go to another state and shoot dice with people you don't even know what the hell you think going to happen
the curse blacks have is killing our own selves  for nonprofit the other race do it for bigger purpose  such as power ,dominion,legacy ,livehood and survival we do it for beefs and small fight
JUST BECAUSE YOU OWN A GUN, DOES NOT MEAN YOU SHOULD USE IT WHEN YOU GET INTO A ARGUMENT.
Out of all the trash "rappers" these days (which is alot) takeoff was my fav amongst them. And if he didn't yell "Momma" before he tookoff to the afterlife that was such a wasted opportunity.
WELL WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM GHETTO PEOPLE.SAME OLD STORY..SAME BS. TEY STILL GONA BLAME IT ON WHITE MEN AND WHITE COP. EXCEPT THEM SELF. THERES NO BLM MARCH
More than a dozen rappers have been killed in the past decade.
Where all the protesters at? Oh yeah it’s ok when they kill each other remember
Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest as they lie in death. Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. Sad to say all will not rest in peace.
This is why when u make a lot of money it’s best to disappear
This is sad news....please leave condolences here...thanks... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvurQitYObM
This is being reported on because they don’t know if the other guy was black they’re hoping it was a Trump supporter but actually everybody supports Trump now
B L K S killing B L K S, you don’t say!
Damn wth man
isnt he the one that sould his sould or whatever and the migos stopped messing with him or whatvr?
Sad sad sad
Just black people doing black people things
R.i.p take off my condolences to the fam rest eazy  👑
Takeoff will be missed R.I.P🙏🏼
So he was stalked, drugged & self medicated over it instead of confronting it while coercion ensues in general concerning the conspiracy to fatally molest him with misappropriated technology in their delusion of grandeur concerning clout & status amidst criminality.   To life science with it.
Im sorry but if this was a white guy who shot him you lot would be going fkn mental but because it was a black guy its not as serious as what it should be! Blacks need to wake up and realise its not white people you should be worried about its your own you guys be killing so many of your own talented individuals, always over petty shit too unless it’s absolutely dead serious then you do you but you kill eachother over where your from if you have money clothes cars shoes phones anything like that! Need to be taught better growing up dont follow no gang shit!
Rip to him may  he rest  in pace hand some
Rip takeoff
Ion trust j prince everybody around either get locked up or die
✔Black♥️💲upremacist's
Derp
The guy who shot takeoff name is tookoff
You can take people out the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of some people.
Prayers for him snd his friends and fam. RIP
Who in the right mind thinks, “Oh you disagree? So anyways I started blasting.”
He takeoff!!
messy 🔥 video sip king
I guess they need the insurance from his death. Let's see who is the beneficiary.
If this was over a dice game this stupidest shit ever
There’s a lot of haters in Houston…
“No one saw” means payback
My condolences to Migos and family and real friends .. his legacy will be forever remembered.. why we can't enjoy life
Oh well. Moving on..
They always was shooting dice wtf i bet he was good so Quavo use to like taking him along a cool relationship
Whoah... I don't even know him or his music but I do love the genre, I can't believe someone is just going to be gunned down at a bowling alley. I hear he has a family. It's a damn shame.
same old, same old... nobody saw who shot him...
He was the best rapper in Migos. The rest are trash.
Kinda weird how there’s been no protests. 🤔
Insane...  these rappers need to start taking care of themselves, just because you have all this money doesn't make you invincible. Im not saying that's the case with takeoff though r.i.p. homie
Well you don't see rock or metal band members getting shot in every year.
The world is very evil now THANKS CERN AND YOUR FUCKINH DEMON PORTAL. I swear everytime they fire that shit up shit just keeps getting worst no blame but I'm very intuned with energy and it feels very thick whereever you go
This is all speculation but here’s my thoughts on what happened, guy that’s standing behind takeoff starts shooting, probably a switch idk I’ve never pulled the trigger on a gun , takeoff jumps up fast clearly shook , and as he stands up he’s now directly in the line of fire and takes a bullet to the head. ( I always wondered why the say get down if someone is shooting, now ik y , someone could be shooting over u ) RIP takeoff a tragedy for sure but could’ve been prevented if a) the guy didn’t shoot from behind Takeoff and B) Takeoff had ducked down instead of jumping up
Soon they will also meet you bro.
Feller
Caught lacking
Rest In Peace Takeoff this is so random. Can people just get along and stop killing each other please? This is exhausting at this point hearing about all these rappers dying.
Why don’t we ever hear about such things in Norway, Japan, or Austria? Has nothing to do with gun laws (Switzerland is more lax) or politics. It’s cultural or rather sub-cultural & until that reality is acknowledged, then it’s not going to change.
thats exactly what happens when rappers hires friends as security , they should of had professional security and not random people with guns
We need to boycott other two fucking killer offset and quavo from music industry, they killed him rip bro takeoff
bozoo got caugh lacking LOOOL
bozooo
Man wtf 😓
Lol, these punks all end up dead or in prison, no loss to society !!!
another one bites the Dust!!
RIP
Pop in the head that what devil thinks about rappers
Just cnt have shit no fuckn where, damn shame, I will never fuck with them in Texas again, especially Houston! Hating ass dude's every fuckn where! Tired of these niggas man, starting to feel Charleston White with each passing day, on GOD! R.I.POWER young man
He didn't deserve dis got shot and killed over a dice game
That boy took off forreal
RIP to a big part of my childhood music inspiration. My prayers go out to the rest of the Migos, and their families.
How da Fuck you shoot the dude you supposed to be there protecting!?😳😡😡 like REALLY!?😓 R.I.P Takeoff man. smfh...
Oh no!
This is what BLM needs to be protesting about!! Violence in there own community and killing role models in there own community over dumb things
A lot of these dudes getting caught off guard. They don't understand that guys on the street have  been cracking at that "Gangsta" lifestyle their WHOLE life hoping to make it big. These kinds of guys  have a hard time witnessing these new guys, that come out of nowhere make it big off of a few "Gangsta"  songs knowing damn well they aren't "gangsta" themselves.   Much like that PB&J Rock (or whatever the h3ll that idiot's name was),  he made a bunch of videos of himself talking about how he "Can't be robbed", next thing you know,  they shot him to death at a waffle house.
Never heard of them. Oh, well.
It's unfortunate that he died but...who is this? I've never heard of this person.
😓😤😡🤬😭😡😡😡😡😡😓💔💔
I blame each and every fonky bllotch in America...              - Cory Holcomb
Wow another shooting people die everyday now 💀
The messed up part was "TakeOff" was one of the migos who actually stayed out of the way, he never really attended those big events like the other two did, and he didn't want to be in  the spotlight like that.
All of these celebrities/artist we just see on TV, listen to on the radio, or follow on social media nowadays comes and goes. Nobody can even enjoy life anymore without someone hating with no disregard to end a persons life. Seems like it's all shit from here. RIP to guy..🙏😞
Did the shooters get captured or did they takeoff?
He was sloppy with his wrist in the bowling alley, so he had to be capped
Why do we never hear about this with Met stars? 🤔
Who cares
Damn bro that’s so sad 😞 RIP praying for his family and friends ❤️‍🩹
What is wrong with black Americans ??? Are we also going to blame white people??? Honestly white life matters
He should've called himself Strike, so the headline would be "Striken"
Takeoff Stay up Ma Breh
Seriously, I wake up and I found this RIP
Rest In Peace, my condolences to his family, friends, and loved ones. God bless everyone and have a good day.
You making all that money and die over a dice game wow!! My heart goes out to the family!
Give 'em guns step back watch 'em kill each other - 2pac RiP and condolences to the family
The album is going to be big
Killed over w dice game . Smh smh 🤦  Houston is Chicago now. Keep voting 🗳 blue .   Where are all the activists now!!!!!!????
What label? Because these labels are looking suspicious while they benefit from their client’s deaths.
thats the culture they promote. is anyone really surprised?
These people at it again .  The Black Lives Matter does not care as usual
Only idiots nd kids cares .All those wannebe Rappers from today.The only Rappers are from the 80 nd 90s.
Who had insurance, hate for him, or profit from his death, so unnecessary. Love to his family.
RIP If anything ever needed to be canceled, It’s rap culture.
Wow I cannot believe this !!! What is going on my god !
Who the hell starts off with 1/3 of the group is dead
So 😭😭
Don't these guys rap about killing and selling drugs? Very cool.
Should've been  rapping about the life, not living it.
Excellent! Another scumbag gone!
Never heard of him or his group but this is popping up everywhere.
RIP 🙏🏽 *My Goodness* 🤦🏽
The trash takes itself out again.
Well well well !!!
These little games make people mad be careful even cards can get u killed
Black Lives matter where you at?  Blk people always complaining about YT folks.... but who detrimental to Blk people more than Blk people? This man died over a dice game for a beef he wasn't even part of..... Blk PEOPLE WAKE THE FK UP!!!!!!!
I'm Shocked! #WayTooYoung #RIPTakeOff
i HOPE THEY DO FIND THE KILLER ..  MAN IM SOO HURT HE WAS SOO LOW KEY
I have watched over the years soooooo many up and coming black men killed by jealousy!!! I'm tired of it. The, "If I can't rise to the top I'll kill those that do to make myself feel better syndrome"!!!
The devil is a lie.
My God. I got chills, got me in tears 🙏
He was the most liked of the Migos group. Sad stuff of affairs. Dang.
Notice the title of his last stories of instagram “stop breathing”..creepy stuff
Noooo.... damnit 🥺 just sad and unnecessary 🙏
Live by the sword die by the sword ~Jesus Christ
Living in 5th ward you hear gunshots all the time, but the type of guns I heard at 2/3 this morning were NOT the usual. I shrugged it off bc it Halloween and you expect shootings here.. but I turned on the police scanner to see what was happening and it said active shooter. I would’ve never guessed it was Takeoff 💔🙏🏾
Even if I was a rapper speaking for myself I wouldn’t even be outside at 2:30 am playing Dice, that’s just my mentality, this shit hurts we lost a great one for the simple fact that he was just minding his own Business and got hit
Protect Kanye
Around 2/3 this morning I heard so many gunshots, I live in 5th ward and I instantly turned on the police scanner to see what was happening. Now I’m just finding out it was Takeoff who died. All my neighbors heard everything 💔
WTF HE WAS THE GOOD ONE!!! 😒 #sacrificed
https://youtube.com/channel/UCUygyreDJjK_-qam5ugTZow
He took off
REST EASY KING 👑
RIP Takeoff 🙏 A talent gone too soon 😥
Hope Quavo learn frim this. Dunce Bat
Rip
Qauvo knows who shot his cousin if he was there!
That's why I work and go home smoke weed and play cod, that's  the only way il get killed, it's nothing out there valuable enough for me to risk my life. RIP
Wearing all that jewelry just makes you a target. A community of violence
And apparently he didnt even do anything, he was just there and got hit by his own team first
Overall sad because he had talent and a career ..sad how people can just take your whole life away in one second .. Humanity needs to change
He was different
Since 1997 Takeoff is the 59th rapper to die by shooting, the seventh this year, and second in Houston this year.  What the hell is going on?
Man what the fuk rest in peace:/
Wen egos collide. May he rest in peace
If you are a multi millionaire, you don't shoot dice for money.  That's for broke niggas.
Aaaah, seriously? So down heartening. Wondering, wast it a stray that hit him, R.I.P. This clearly illustrates black on black cruelty in the U.S.  How We Coming  huh?
Nothing good happens at 2:30am in the morning….  Kids, stay in school and don’t do drugs. Don’t illegally gamble. 👍
Poor baby.  28 is SO young.
This world is not our home. Choose wisely who's side your on.
😢 Prayers to him and his family! GOD bless
everybody walking with a gun in america.. wtf.. that country is hell🥲🥲🥲🥲
America is literally a warzone
Offset Wassup Bro ? 😂
Ah well
he took off to heaven
When keeping it real goes wrong smh
This just seems so suspect
Come on man.. unbelievable. Why this bs gotta happen all the time? I’m so bummed about this.. closed off bowling place and ppl in there were probably invited and this happens wow.. they had security and a gun got in like wtf shits crazy
RIP man, still can’t believe it
Another rapper sacrificed someone is about to come up that knows him Offsets album Dropping Soon coincidence?
Rich as fucc yet still rolling dice outside a bar at 2 am?
He didn't even seem to be a rapper that speaks violence in his music 😪 r.i.p takeoff
oh come on are you serious, i wanted to listen to migos for the next 20 years
Rest in peace Take....He is a big inspiration to me in my own shit. I dropped 1 music videos on my channel this month. To anyone that shows love and joins me on this journey to success, I will forever be thankful 🔥🙏.
MY heart is broken 💔 he was so quiet & sweet
The security guards must have saw what was going on and decided that they didn't sign up for it this. Probably fled along with everyone else. Probably thought it was easy money until they realized that you can't spend it if you're 6 ft deep.
They had to have gottern the guy on camera cmon
Crazy world, man… RIP brotha
Soft ass people can’t fight anymore
Black people need to stay away from each other. It always ends up ugly, we should have learned this by now.
being rapper in america is like being a soldier going to war.
JESUS SAVES John 3:16
Live by the gun, die by the gun
What happened to a fist fight damn
R.I.P takeoff😔condolences to your family💔
know ine knows who this dude ..now that hes dead .. his crappy music well takeoff    ..
They know who shot him.
cool
He joined the wrong gang. He should have joined the right gang and then he wouldn't have been shot.
American culture this is terrible
RIP ❤❤❤
28 years old. Smh.
did nobody really see the shooter?
Who kill him? A white guy?
And still after all this year,  no gun control implemented for texas
Takeoff death was completely unnecessary and avoidable. Just so senseless. Sick of the nonsense and people not being able to speak instead of stab and shoot. #RIPTakeoff
Sad
wait nobody saw him get shot or who did it but they know that he was playing dice when it happened how do they know he was playing dice if they don't know who it was with
Well he should have had his brother, landing protect him.
The only guy I really  loved  in migos 😭
I pray the family finds answers and peace
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.... ANOTHER WACK RAPPER DEAD
It’s only gonna get worse! The world is evil. Watch your backs, be aware of your surroundings at ALL TIMES!
America is an insane country to live in , good luck to y’all living there . rip takeoff
My prayers to Takeoff family and Migos just heard about this I’m still in shock 💖💖💖😔😔😔🕊️🕊️🕊️🌹🌹🌹🌹
Bleep culture is disgusting. Without them, the crime rate would be nearly nonexistent.
Never heard of him.
Another 1 bites the dust  Whos next? Stay tuned.
A good person does not get shot at a party for no reason.
They set him up to be killed. Death clause.
Wow
Someone is his own entourage shot him on accident, shooting at another group. What a shame.
Over a dice game
One wack rapper gone yesss
I'm not even a Migos or Takeoff fan but damn I truly never expected that we would lose him, I can't show fake love but rest in piece, he didn't need to die.
They took him off, get it lol😂
A fight broke out over a game of dice. Makes total sense. That's the kind of thing that regularly leads to this kind of violence. My crochet group is a super tense dangerous gathering as well. You copy another gal's scarf pattern, things can get pretty dodgy with all those hooked needles in the hands of sweater makers.
People aren’t going to like what I have to say and I really don’t care. First, when you are a prominent person you have zero business being out at a place like this at 2:30am. You put yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, then these things can happen. What good ever comes from being out shooting dice at 2:30am? Second, this stuff happens every day…in every city. And it happens to people that ARE NOT celebrities. Where is your outrage, anger and shock about THAT? The very idea that all of you are “outraged” means nothing. Nothing at all. You only give a damn because it happened to a celebrity. Save your fake outrage, shock, “prayers” etc…when you start giving a damn about this happening to ANYONE, then your words mean something. Everyone be safe.
Ripiss 💯💯
A lot of people there but nobody saw anything.  Gotta love it.
Stay out of Houston, it’s dangerous out there
This world and everything going on is shameful 🤦‍♂️ ridiculous
SMH I tell people all the time about that gambling, shooting dice, & playing cards. RIP brother
RIP Takeoff
Dooces
Oh wow who cares.
Who?
nah man, this gotta be fake news
TakeOff was one the migos that I actually liked and homie was so laidback ... WTF😢😢😢
🕊️🕊️
What a shame. Rest in peace big guy.
You ever notice nobody from thr entertainment world ever gets killed in other countrys...smh
Condolences to all. Off set and CADRI b aswell. Let’s all learn from this. Stop the nonsense
houston was bad in the 80s-90s then it mellow out. then ever since all them wannabe gangbanger from california move to houston the crime rate jump back up again
I mean he posted a video on social media of him driving around with a gun on the front seat.  So he could have easily killed somebody as well but because he is a “famous” rapper his negligence and bad behavior is overlooked.  If I was driving around with a gun like that I would do jail time for sure and if I got shot I wouldn’t make it on TMZ because our society is so messed up in our way of thinking we look and mourn people that are just as bad as the ones that made them victims
This is sad: Despicable. The crime in the area needs to subside.  This is bad for Take Off: *Houston, we have a problem.*
the shitty part about all this is it was his own homie.
He playing Dice 🎲 game a man worth 26 million get shot. That’s a dangerous game
So sad. May God bless his family and friends.🙏🏾
Take off? Shît…he gone lol
Isn't rappers all about that life? Gangs and killing each other
Need to find new hobbies 🤷🏽‍♀️. Country music DONT have these PROBLEMS!!!
Let me guess, let’s blame it on white supremacy…
I'm not surprised by this low life trouble kind of people get killed on his own world. At 2:00 am, most a normal people are sleeping so next day we can go to WORK a have a decent life!
I have no more empathy or sympathy to give. I'm all out. From columbine shooting, 9/11, Virginia Tech, all the school, church, & marathon massacres. It's happening so often. Damn near every hour some atrocious act. We can't stay in a state of heartbreak, shock and sorrow forever. Every time I turn on the news "Another mass shooting" is the first thing I see/hear. Anyone else see this and feel numb at this point? Not that you DON'T care. It's that You just can't care? Not like you use to anyway. The most you can say about it is "It's unfortunate". Which it is. I just, I don't know. You can't wake up every day to a tragedy and not have any effects. It's cold to feel this way. I know. I just don't know what to do man. This shit is the new normal. It's getting worse. Not better. It's like the modern American frontier. The Wild West. We aren't progressing as a country. We're regressing.
Cry me a river, I'll give you a tissue. Hardest, gangster rap bar ever!!!!!!
#R.I.PTaKeOFF.cuzzMuchLoveOnThePoccetHoodCornerPoccetLove💯
Takedown
Imagine thinking Houston is a nice place!
RIP Takeoff, he is playing dice now with god and Heath Ledger 😢
Somewhere I read it was friendly fire from one of his guys
Uncle probably destroyed rate now rest in paradise Nephew  Nov.1st will be remembered as takeoff day!!
I don't even know what to say😔. Not our Take man...
I like how he speaks highly about him and not just saying a rapper killed in Houston   rest in peace takeoff
there goes another one down the crapper
why don't you just admit it america, we are in a world war and our young people are all the victims of this madness
This is getting fucking ridiculous. No offense, but I'm so glad I don't live in America. We're I'm from, shit like this doesn't happen.
Never heard of him. Like 99% of these losers dying for the dumbest reasons. Guess someone has ‘cred’ now.
Who?
R.I.P 😭😭
He don’t bother nobody. Sad sacrifice🎃
A dice game and you a multi-millionaire really
Rolling dice on the billiards table, and rolled Snake Eyes!
Quavo wasn’t supposed to get shot or anything it was only supposed to be takeoff the rap industry takes out rappers on a big money scheme insurance fraud by killing people and sacrificing people is an old ancient method that people will not understand until they get into the word of Jesus Christ
Thug life takes another pos?  This is NOT a surprise,  sometimes sh!t does take itself out.
I am so sorry to hear this, I am sorry for all of the rappers and young people period killing and being killed. He was just well known. I pray for peace and comfort to his family and loved ones❤❤❤
Headshooooot
Assailant was heard saying "where is Nancy"
They tookoff after takeoff...
Do it look like I blubabdoboujie? RIP
Not good year or season to be a  Rappers just do something else
Takeoff? Tf kind name is that?
Quavo & security guards know exactly who did it..  .stay tuned to what happens in the upcoming hours, days & maybe even weeks.. .vigilante justice will be served
casualty of a dice game - big L
He probably shitted through the holes #FromtheBottom😂❤
Rapper shot? That doesn't make sense
There was a reason he was shot and killed you might want to wait before you post all your BS to find out why I was shot I can just about guarantee you he's just another gangster
Yes
And how many folks will cooperate with the police to get justice? That's the saddest part.
I QUIT Hiphop... too much violence
My favorite migo Nooooooooooo!!!!! 😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔😢😔.
Another young life lost make no sense….
Who cares on God, looks like he didn't takeoff soon enough 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Rip 🙏🙏🙏
So sad...This has too stop...
Unbelievable 💔
Sounds like they want other black people to kill each other from this situation.
This is a rapper that don't even be all in the media with drama and beef. Rarely speaks. Just a chill dude and his fate was unfortunate
We don’t fuck around over here in Houston,   y’all wanna be on media and act up, we killers will shoot and get away with it. I suggest y’all stay home 🖕
Damn these rappers dropping like flies. That's thehip hopculture for you tho fucking gun violence and drugs is all there seems to be songs about. Consience rappers aren't the megastard anymore sadly.
Holy craps!!
ohhhhh no....another rapper killed by the very violence he promotes....😂
Hope they catch the white dude that shot him
It’s crazy because he was the best Mogo 🤔 you gotta ask yourself who benefits
A  Decent Guy killed by low life Thug Shad Bastards ! My the killers rot in hell !
Nothing good comes out from being out at 2:30am. God bless his soul. He brought joy to many by his music!
Your own man popping reckless..JUST DONT MAKE SENSE..BLACK ON CRIME BLACK WAY BEFORE OUR TIME..TOOK A BROTHER LIFE THATS NOT RIGHT,CRIED CAUSE HE DIED OF TRIFLING DEATH WHEN HE TOOK HIS VERY LAST BREATH...JUSTICE ICE VERSE SELF DESTRUCTION  SONG THEY DID IN THE KRS ONE TRACK.
Shit sad 😢
My hearts broken, we live in a cold world. May he Rest In Peace😔.
Like all these gun toking, drug dealing rappers are out being wild as fuck and no one messes with them?! But you kill takeoff? Takeoff?!? The literal chillest and nicest rapper in the game?? No one deserves death but a lot of people ask for it and takeoff was just living his life low key and you gotta shoot him? I don’t condone violence but I hope they smoke the pussy who did it. Fucked up man. So pointless.
nothing comes out good playing dice at 2 am RIP
Some don't sound right
Its a shame that fame makes you superhuman when that is not the case. Whatever you want you for recreation you build as an add on to your house like most dream of in their house. Be flashy at home. Come out only to go to work and come home. Stop hanging out! Once you famous you are perceived as more than what you are and the villains are always looking to take out a super/anti hero. Right or wrong you lose freedom when you get famous.
You gotta have more sense. You're in Houston city at 2am rolling dice gambling.
Notice that this type of thing NEVER happens to Country singers? Think about it.
Its so funny listening to white reporters pronounce the names of rappers or rap songs 🤣🤣
This has to fucking stop
If dozens of people were there and nobody saw the shooter, then I guess idgaf. I’m gonna hit enter now and never think about this again.
Let me just say BLM right ?
Different types of evil are available and anyone of them can kill you!!! R.I.P
Omg
No 😥
Did he live a life to please Jesus? Where did his soul go?
Rip big bra
RIP Takeoff, my condolences to his loved one. He was the least problematic rapper out there... I am really sad!
LOL!! "Early morning shooting" 2:30 am "Playing dice." "Nobody saw who did the shooting." LOL What could possibly happen at such a time and place carrying on such activities? LOL Should have been home in bed like the rest of normal civilization. Don't go to stupid places at stupid times with stupid people doing stupid things.
I cried when I heard this new. My heart absolutely breaks for quavo….dude saw the whole thing. STOP KILLING PEOPLE OVER DISAGREEMENTS. Rip takeoff man. 😔❤️
In America, Guns are like toothbrushes, everybody has one. Guarantee if he had no weapon he wouldnt have attacked him.
Oh no
15 rappers this year, 0 country stars shot...mmmmm
It's sad 😔 my prayers are with their family .
How does making music draw enemies?
1 way to stop shitty auto tune garbage
Damn
Meh , nothing new, all part of the illuminati anyways
Damnnnmm😭😭😭
Damn bro.
Only cared for Versace & hotel 🎉 but rest ezzy..champ #stoptheviolencestoppartyingsotuffjoe
Man... Shit crazy.... Who's next?
BLM is a scam. They are blowing eachother’s heads off over dice. I have no more sympathy to give this “community” of liars and killers.
RIP 🙏😢
No no no no I do not believe this Jesus christ
Wow I can't believe it.. so sad how people just call shit out right a way wanna shoot and not handle it in a different way.  May he rest in peace. Gone too soon man. May condolences and prayers too his family and close friends 🙏 🙏🙏🕊
Oh snap he really died? Sheesh i thought  it was a prank cause I been seeing all kinda celebrities die the past week that certainly weren't dead
Black Lives Matter,, where are you? Just amazing how all these rappers, year after year are involved in shootings.
Looks like he's definitely off bad and boujee part 2
Old school head, not my generation but my heart goes out to friends, family, and fans of this YOUNG man. Hip-hop loses too many artists too early. 😞
its sick how they  are pulling these guns out over anything
Why was there guns at a private party? You know who you invited
The left: Ban bowling alleys & billiards
Naw bruh take was my favorite migo wtf is dis
You don’t get in arguments in Texas it’s like the wild wild West out there everybody’s got guns.
Devastating? Hardly....
It's  sad to hear all of these successful and rich rappers losing they life over bullshit
No fucking way dude
Wtf
Of course it's blue Houston. Houston and Austin (mini California) bring shame to red Texas.
Gangbangers are going to gang bang!
got caught lacking...
RIP takeoff  💔🙏🏻🎤👑🎶
Black thugs matter
MY QUESTION IS WHO TF SHOT HIM?
Who would have thought. RIP, you were gone too soon.
Stuff is always happening in bowling alley’s all of a sudden. Messy title of the song tells it all
Why are people so heartless coz we are losing so many great legends🤧.RIPTAKEOFF❤️
WAIT! Another rapper died violently, I can't believe it.
Nooooo!!! Not another rapper!! Whyyyy???!!!
👁🔺️👁🔺️👁🔺️
😯😳No Fu*king Way !! ..   " Takeoff "  Damn Yo ... Another Great Solider down ‼️🤦🏽‍♂️ ..smfh   ...Blessings to All This Man Family ❤🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
I've never heard of the guy, but this is really sad
A dice game.
Why is it that I never hear about these “rappers” until after they are shot and killed ✊🏿🤡?
Rest in Peace 🙏
Who?
Lol 😪
Now he really  take off , jijijijiji
This is actually a rapper l knew. I did follow their music..but it sad these rapper are dropping like flies  smh .
It’s always a lot of people and NO ONE sees anything. It’ll never stop if people don’t start speaking up.
That's what they do, another dead rapper ,big deal
https://youtube.com/shorts/-CLxhp6Dm-Q?feature=share Actual footage
Honestly a tragedy so sad. People need to start taking their security into their own hands not rely on police and security guards. This is sad proof that they can't help when a situation arises.
News should stop playin' with us like this. WHAT is goin' on people... im just wakin' up to this what da' hell!! 😢😢😢😭😭
Very very sad stupid people killings innocent man r i p brother mes condolences for its family :(
Even though he didn't have bars he will always be remembered as someone i didn't listen anyway and....yeah,bye.
So?
In this world people ain't living there just existing
This whole scene Messy.
I guess you can say that he took off
bro PnB just got shot and killed a few months ago, what the heck is going on, these guys need to start having hardcore security everywhere, even if it means at parties in their private lives.
So he went from Takeoff to Takeout? 🤔
Nothing good happens after midnight..
We black peoples have need to change ours ways together each others. You don’t heard any others race doing this to each other’s. And we need the GOD for real. Ours is too evil towards each other’s.
Damn sad💔💔
Oh No! Who?
no😞
Jamaica.
NOOOOOO!!! 😭Takeoff was the last rapper I'd expect to die so soon. RIP.
This is so sad I actually really liked their music
Rest In Peace
I hope he knew the lord
It seems the folks becoming more and more violent. Human detritus everywhere. It’s people violence always
Very sad
Well that’s shitty …. But when you play the game you need to know your eventually gonna lose
Don’t care
Hmmm
Rapper?! Bahahahah right! No career to speak of!
NOOOOOOOO
Wtf
Never heard of him,nor the last 7 rappers that died...  I say when we die we all call ourselves rappers
I'm over it
It was his destiny, his job description alluded to it.
Most dangerous job
Put the guns down
R.I.P. ma'am
Rappers are dying faster than any entertainer in history.  Something seems a little suspect.
God Bless this young man’ so sad’
Can't go around to many people that look like me
Bloodclat
Seems like in the 90's, during a height of gang shootings, members figured out no one wins when your family members die.  Looking forward to the current generation learning the same lessons.  I hope his families loss isn't in vain.
You reap what you sow.
Ha HAAAAA.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉💩💩💩💩💩💩
I pray he had time to repent
😭😭😭😭😭😭
I bet it was a white supremacist. Sadly, if this guy wasn't a rapper/famous, it would have never made the news. Black Lives Matter?
My condolences to Takeoff’s family.  These Thugs need to grow up and get over themselves with this “So-Called Thug Life.”
What the fuck you mean no one saw who did the shooting and I quess the is camera inside buildings
BLM
Rest In Peace ☮️ legend
Thought it was tpain for a second hahaha
When you become successful in life, you should never go back to the hood.
This is definitely a devastating loss for the hip hop community, but a major victory for society! Black on black violence is a normal practice among rappers and BLM activists. Most of senseless killing of blacks are committed by blacks. Not by whites. Not by cops. Not by dietary diseases from their greasy fried foods. It’s mostly black, and the national news will focus on everything else but that to avoid being called “racist”! Never heard of him and he won’t be missed.
Rappers should leave that dice game alone for the hoods... Devils playground ... R. I. P bro
Natural Death
I’m sure there were camera’s
Mother fucker 🦁... This betterrrr not be.. one of the Migos boys ..mannnnnnnn... Fuckin... Bitches...  Now... Another... Musician gone ...  wtf.....   Now... Who gonna.. be ... Takeoff ... In his music ..  Now we can't even listen ... To him ..   Cause y'all hating ass bitches... I am 😡.....  Another star ⭐... Gone..... Come onnnn.... All of them.... talented ... Together...  ... You......... idiots.... 👁️✝️👁️ Just recently found... And...  Started ......  to listening to their music.....  Shame ..  Takeoff ...Rest in peace .....
Dedicated to the memory of Takeoff - https://youtu.be/vZ3CsNZE2os
i wonder if BLM will march down the streets for this artist and protest
Do we really surprised always the same kind of people r I p bro
I see Houston has become very deadly for rappers… stay away!!!
Ungodly hour. Protect yourself
This is sus because MIGOS was starting to not have him on many songs and it was too much talk about it like wtf I'm done with these young dumb NIGGAS
Good we less of this garbage noise they make
Texas
These young brothers become rich and successful, and still hang out with Pookies and ray rays. It’s their own fault, unfortunately. These brothers are on demon time.
Heard his music sucks
A part of a founded trinity has departed this existence. In case of not realizing what is truly important in life, this lost is what we are subject to witness. To have money and power, a level of wisdom must be accompanied by it. Life is fragile, but understanding is more, as it quakes and shakes to find its place while incorporating aspects before settling. An instance of respect and its opposite disrespect, goes along with life and death to let go or hold on to lessons learned and lessons missed, is what all people have difficulty as we are embattled. An adjustment of importance needs to be withheld and kept close to thought's sequence. As you are honored in your new form, watch over the cared ones who still remain on this battlefield. Blessed be the fallen!
Tyrone on Tyrone crime
What do you mean I was left off bad and boujee I wasn't left off bad and boujee
It's the way of their culture tho....u speak it into existance... bitches...money...drugs.....guns...fame...murderrrrrrrr. 🤷🏼‍♀️
R.I.P. OffSet 😭🙏🏽 he was my favorite N.W.A. Member
R.I.P Easily the most talented of the 3.  Fucked up
So tired of this shit! Nothing’s worth being a rapper bro, you couldn’t pay me to do that shit.
Noooo let this please not be true
billiards?  nah bowling?  nah     dice   if he had played billiards or bowling he would be alive
Who?! Aw man I thought that was a Yin Yang Twin.🤷🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾
wow this is not right  keep resting to take off my prayers with his family and offset and quavo this is such a loss and devastating news to wake up to I know the music world is hit hard with this one
Of course no one saw who did the shooting he's a rapper
He tookoff…Houston is still vibrant though.  Strong communities
This dude and alot of these rappers are reasons young kids are killing and shooting at each other. The Irony, live up what you rap about. Its going to keep going, inevitable..
Black Lives Matter where’s Biden condemning this
Rip❤️🕊
Sad !! Why were they playing dice in a bowling alley ? I don't understand, they should have bowled and left. These Cowards these days quick to shoot anyone. And Quavo was right there holding him , its sad that will forever change him.  So much blood he was lifeless , it's sad !! Rest In Peace !! 🙏
Headshot! Anotha one 🎯
A sad for humanity. We lost a diamond
Crazy to me how quavo was there too and ain’t do nun
Wtf heeeeelllllll naw damn im in shock is this real
Strike 3 you're out!
This truly sucks 💔
He ain't even one of them, Ball In Heaven Takeoff, just sad....🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
The World Of Hip-Hop No ones safe not even ☝🏼
No matter if the rapper isn't causing trouble they are dying like flies with SHOOTINGS. To me this is sad and pathetic how this keeps happening. We don't hear or see any singers, actors or any other celebrity going through all of these senseless shootings. R.I.P smh
Gone too soon🙏🏻
Rest in peace only death separates 🚀🛸
Nah, not in Houston! Why couldn't he be in Atlanta! Damn!
People are absolutely insane nowadays this guy this government makes it easy for criminals do what they want to people and kill them
No one will step up, silence is code of streets....smh
We all need to use the cancel culture to cancel gangsterism
Just aweful... another young man gone for what????🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Live up to what you rap about...Automatic, Automatic, ghostface killers, 21,🎶🎶🎶🎵
Never heard of him don't care.
Man you folks have gotten that weak in the head when a disagreement get you life in prison. Dumb as hell. RIP and condolences to the family.
You Can't,,, Play 👉 Both Sides of The Lord Tables  did He give Up ☝️ Riches For Jesus Christ
Krazy!!!
"A bowling alley in bowling Houston"? Lol that can't be a real place
Generation of cowards, in the men days we used them hands black that eye fat that lip, we wasn't afraid to face each other these cowards pull guns cause they scared.
You black people are just massacring each other. “The man” doesn’t have to do anything.
🤷🏻‍♂️
HEY!?!?!?............That would make for a great lyric! "Was shot in the head and later pronounced dead"!  Thank You.......Thank You!.........I'll be here all weak.
Change the music and you change the narrative. This is a false lifestyle those people feel like they have to prop up. It’s an internal culture war.
ITS CMERAS THIS SHOULD BE A EASY CASE
Ugly dies….Party at my fucking house later y’all!
Jealousy kills
Who cares. How is this news?
L for blk community
Who’s dat
Liees 😢
Lived like a thug. Died like one.
Being from Atlanta, and specifically Gwinnett, just wanna let you know they gonna find you. They gonna find you and I hope you spend the rest of your life suffering getting your back blown out in prison fr. Y’all really ain’t shit bro. Don’t even give people the chance to defend themselves, one day y’all gonna fuck around with the wrong person who’s ready for that shit , someone that’ll make the aggressor turn to a victim. I’m getting tired of losing people to the SAME STUPID VIOLENCE. God my heart is fucking broken…
They should question his boyfriend…maybe he knows sonething?
Sacrifice
Rest in Paradise 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 Edited: this is why I barely go out, people lost they damn mind
These homies need to get their shit together .
This the shit Charleston white be talking about smh shit sad forreal🤦🏾‍♂️
No such thing as death. We get the system now, the God's are back.  🐉🐉🐉
And I took a fat dump this morning. Who cares, right?
Who?... We don't miss him. 😂
Another sacrifice. Every month, one or more gets killed. The other did not get shot, hmm.
1/3=33..masonic ish
This is sick and shows so much ill will and lack of respect for human life.  Rappers are being killed by the dozens these days and more defining is that these are young black men killing young black men.  We protest a white police officer putting his knee on a black man's neck but kill each other every day like it means nothing.  Why is Black Lives Matter not protesting this?
Everyone wants to be the next Tupac? well let's congratulate our latest winner.
Great picture.
Shot by a stray bullet.  Had nothing to do with the altercation.  So freaking sad man! 😔  RIP King 🙏🏿🕊🕊
When you know your becoming a rising star your security should be the up most important thing in your life he should of spared no expenses for safety!
RIP
So stupid. Still surround yourself with thugs and lowlifes and this is the shit that happens.
Omg we lost takeoff!? Is his brother takeover okay!? 🤣
Wow on the devils holiday too
Offset took him out.
Nah this ain’t right….
Still can't believe that
what devastation the hop hop world is toxic as hell
his unc had em taken out
Rip T 🫡🙏🏼
OH NO NO!!! RIP TAKE OFF!! 😢
Dumb nigha was a millionaire shoulda stayed home and learned how to carry himself like a millionaire not a thug 😂now he dead
The person who disagreed with Takeoff wasn't an adherent of black lives matter.  egos versus egos in this world.
His record label later this month releasing his box set of collected works entitled " bowling alley gangsta "
Who?
“You gon lose money fuckin wit me” - X
I can almost ganruntee you , that a black person killed him.
No no no nooooooooooooooooooooo bro I'm so done with this world 😔🖤🦇
This is sad. They need to find the shooter and lock him up
I blame blm for his death
Rich and famous shooting dice @2am in front of a billowing ally. What could go wrong? Smh
Damn 😞
It's been said time and time again. The vast majority of the issues within the black community, the drugs, the murders, etc... could be solved with one change. Reducing and eliminating fatherless homes. For this to happen though, there needs to be a change of heart towards Jesus.
😢😢😢 this so sad
This is not a going to be an unsolved mystery.. reward money is growing in Georgia.
RIP
Messy.....how ironic
Ain’t no fucking way😭😭😭😭😭😭
Texas is a horrible place. Don’t move to Texas ✅
This really is starting to piss me off now. This shit is out of control.
Probably got killed over jealousy. Black men are a jealous breed probably bc they are so feminine.
Am thinking this was like in a club or something. Shot and killed in a bowling alley in a mall?? Ridiculous, Bros. Ridiculous.
Whoever was losing that dice game got mad asl💀 RIP to a real one.
There was security guards there but didn’t see anything Ookay. RIP takeoff
Why do they even bother hanging out together? They know damn well they'll never get along together. They're smart enough to make the money but, dumb enough to lose their life over arguing. This is all they live for today... killing each other it's never going to end. I've lost count on how many young rappers lost their lives this year.
From take-off to took-off
Who?
Oh no. Anyway.
Whenever I hear Migos I automatically think LGBTQ🌈🌈🌈
no blood on the scene thank goodness 🤔
Who?
Awwww so sad.
Arrest all of those who are involved 💯
SCO.Self Cleaning Oven
As an old school hip hop head, I was never a fan of Migos calling themselves The Greatest Rap Group. However, I still respected all they did for hip hop. Takeoff was by far the most talented member in my eyes, yet he didn’t seem to get the shine that Quavo and Offset received.
It’s crazy none of his boys shot back.  None are going to help police either.
Boooooyyyy WTF 😢
😲 wow
Whatttt ???
Who ? 🎳
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
so the shooter shot takeoff and took off
can rappers please change their culture and quickly   Just ridiculous uncalled for nonsense.. Bless his family..
Guess he couldn’t land- could be worse than bowling is on the toilet.  Was it worth squeezing the juice?
PEOPLE STAY TF AWAY FROM HOUSTON TEXAS 💯💯💯
Just another spec under the fingernail of life
This is heartbreaking 💔 😢
Descansa en paz Takeoff. Soy mexicano y aquí el género hip hop y rap los matan.
RIP buddy
Migos to Dos 🤣😅
The fact that TMZ has more news than the actual news is sad 😢 R.I.P TAKE 😢😢😢 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
L'enfer
Ashy Larry lost another dice game. What a shame. How is anyone surprised?
Typical behavior. Oh well at least no productive members of society were injured 👍
Takeoff gets dropped in halloween shit sound like an industry sacrifice bruh🤔
"The harder you flash = The harder you get flashed on" - Mos Def
its not a devastating loss for rap man the migos suck yall trry to make every rapper that dies a legend takeoff was far from it lol, that being said hes the only one out of them all who had rap respect from the rap rap community.
Wow RIP 😇🙏💙🙏😇🙏💙🙏😇
RIP😢Shot by another black man smh. Lack of accountability is the destruction of the black communities. My black a$$ hate the hood 😡 if there are 3-4 black ppl in a venue  I’m out yes I stereotype because I was stab/rob in the Bronx by 3 black women. Killing each other like savages but hey it’s the system fault 🙄
In other news...drive by h00drats, are shooting up neighborhoods and killing innocent children...but hey, who cares.
Oh hell naww...bro when I saw this headline, I couldn't even imagine. It's not even gang related. This crazy RIP takeoff damn
Smh
A thugs life, a thugs death!
I'm 45 years old and this hurts my heart I never was a big fan of the group but I respect  those young  men I have seen so many people  die in hip hop its so stupid and upsetting  I wish this shit would stop rip King  we have to start being  really careful  out here smh
I thought this was clickbait at first, this is so sad 😢
"playing dice"....
Yay!  Everyone cheer!  Another wanna-be thug BLMoron cRap 'artist' (drooler) down for the dirt nap!  Spectacular!
Bowling at 2:30am inda morning 🤦🏻‍♂️ in HOUSTON!?? Cmon u shoulda known better bruh
What?! This got to stop guys 💔💔💔💔🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Disgusting…
One in the ground- now sell those  brass chains for 1.25 per pound.
Damn man damn all the good rappers n people die faster then the ones that do harm m bad he was a good man from wat I've saw growing on his music n shit like he wasn't a bad person didn't even b in drama
Rap rivalry  cannot share the wealth
He wasn’t even causing any issues, minding his own business but stupid gun happy idiots just firing off like little shits. It all just keeps going downhill. RIP Takeoff! This shit is so sad.
HAVE SECURITY WITH GUNS AND VEST EVERY WHERE YOU GO!!! YOU A WALKING BAG!! GOTTA STOP!!😑
With all due respect they all look alike lil baby lil John lil harry lil Tyrone quavo take off take down take breathe off set I swear to god idk whice is whice lol rip my guy  now u die alone it’s only u and good deeds tell god how many hoes u fukd and drugs u did and ppl u shot and ppl u fukd thier life up thinking u made it batychho take your money with u and your lambo mother fuker ur in a whole 10x10 your tops
This is all these rappers and their enterouge do these days, shoot at each other over nothing.  How utterly denigrating and horrifying for the families. It seems like this senseless snuffing out of young lives will never end. *smh*
For more,vote democrats.
No Fucking Way........... Bro what the fuck?!?!???!!! R.I.P Take Off, I can't believe this bullshit
R.i.P take off I always look up to you quavo and offset and now your gone man I'm still shook after finding Never thought sum one from favorite rap group would be gone soon Rest in piece I hope you doing good up above 🕊️🌅
Man I’m sick af right now! RIP TAKEOFF
Wow who tf killed one of the 3 amigos
This is so sad
🙏🏾😭
rappers dropping like flies.
agent is losing a lot of rappers
🤔 Rap game today one of the deadliest careers in America today.🤔
Sad. People have to do better
Talk shit about another dead rapper… Next thing you know you’re the one six feet under, funny how this world works when karma finally decides to strike… Fuck Migos
What a coincidence that these rappers keep getting killed. Meanwhile the labels who sign them and put up life insurance for them, steadily getting paid. Looks like these fools are worth more dead than alive. 😂
Fox doesn't even care enough to get the details and titles right. Go back to reporting on Trump.
Rest In Peace ❤
Where are the video tapes at?
Nigga dis happened out here by my hize on da North. Das krazy shit. Another dead fukin rapper man.....
This shatters my heart I am praying for  all families loved ones concerned   God needs to watch over them
Sacrifice
I just hope it wasn't another black person that killed him , other wise what matters If the saying Black Life's Matter!!! Would be very sad .
this is unbelievable
There is bowling 'etiquette.' Hope this didn't have anything to do with it. I remember asking my roommates, in college, to go bowling and when they finally decided to say 'yes,' a few months later, they put on this 'game face' and they acted and bowled with a certain type of 'novice presentation' that wasn't winning over our 'lane neighbors.' It was like they were all alone as these 'star bowlers,' in a busy bowling alley. And they were going for strikes and they actually did pretty well, but they never wanted to go back, because everyone hated them. I hated them, too. But it WAS kinda funny to see how people, who don't know anything about socializing, do their bowling time. It's better to be the WORST bowler in the alley, meaning me, and know how to observe others, who know skill and have savvy around a bowling alley, and bowl a few gutter balls every couple of minutes, than a show off, with this annoying style of play and presence.
Oh well, life goes on.
lost his life over $10 probably...these people are foolish and why does 1 envy them
These rappers are dying every year smh
"A" Migos?  Come on Fox its "Migos"
Offset offed him I’m sure sacrifice for his wicked family own gain
bet it was a white supremacisss
_NO WAY, DAMN, RIP BRO 🙏💯%_
🙏🏽
Live bye the gun,die by the gun
Wtf r.i.p
No way! Only the best are leaving us! Wow unreal im probably next.
R.I.P. BIG DOGG 💫🙏💫
Rip to one of the greats 😔 I hope he’s looking at the stars now from heaven!
I swear our people be killing for no reason a dam dice game smh he’s was my guy man
Money can't save your soul. Only Jesus can save you. Follow Yeshua and not money. You can't take your money with u when you die
Its so sad
Culture....right?
The H done took out Three Rappers y’all niggas is wild in 713 y’all tried to get Benny the Butcher y’all and Cali is a no fly zone
Over shooting dice
😢
Boycott all the violent music coming from these artist. Period rip takeoff

Lower dimensional behavior they say quavo was getting mad about losing money u suppose to be a baller what happen
DJ Khaled- "Another one!"
Tremendous lost are you kidding my  bro this people rap about violence no wonder why they end Up like this
youtube.com/c/ActiveSelfProtection would say, “don't go to stupid places, at stupid times, with stupid people, doing stupid things.”
That’s some real ghetto nigga shit getting shot in a dice game SMH
The streets don’t love nobody kids stay in school 🏫
America is fucked
Huh is this real?
you figure you make so much money you could rent out a bowling alley so you don’t have any enemies or haters with in the realm of yourself.
Another rapper to the slogan list: -Pop Smoke got smoked -XXXTENTACION got X’s on his eyes -And now Takeoff has taken off to the heavens
Rip takeoff
They were mad he was left off bad n boujee
Not surprised…..
The world we live in is a disgrace, no wonder  old schools shake their heads in disappointment
Black Lives Matter
🙏🏼
Damn he TOOKOFF.
Life has no meaning to some people.
Shit culture
Hopefully ignorant ass Kanye West is next.
Another wrapper. Trash taken out
This breaks my heart as an aunty. So sorry for your loss
Wtf
Of course Texas... I am sad but more over I'm just disappointed that the act of taking a life has apparently become so casual.  It's no better here in my city in Tennessee. We're one of the top tourist destinations in the country but also have been on CNN twice in the year for mass shootings and currently at a  close 2nd  in the whole nation for firearm thefts. We're just pitiful.  Something more than Mental Health and Gun Control needs to be done.  It doesn't have to be like this.
Gangsta garbage is what it really is. Bunch of jealous tough guys that don't know how to fight.
Becoming a rapper instantly puts a target on your back.
Young Black Beautiful brothas. You have no idea how much I fear for your safety, worry about your plight and pray for your safety and your future in this cruel world we live in. I am not a fan of this groups music. I doubt I ever heard it. I'm just a black mother with adult black sons this young man's age and older and I feel the pain and grief of those this gifted brotha has left behind. I feel their sorrow and I am so saddened we are here yet again...... My deepest condolences to the parents, family, real friends and fans.
You can’t be around haters🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Once you become successful you have to come out from amongst them. You can't give people access to you.
Biggie, Tupac now Take off!, something is going on, rappers are being targeted.
Bye
Rip  But yeah not smart of the migos to play with random people dice with money 🤷🏻‍♂️
It's sad losing your life over a damn dice game this world is sick
Rest In Peace I been fucking with your music since young rich niggaz
I don’t listen to rap anymore man, these cats are getting murdered left and right. Back to classical music for me. I think we’ve killed more blacks then the kkk by now
Imagine being grown a$$ men arguing over a game and shooting someone over it... Pathetic losers.  RIP to this man and condolences to his family and friends affected by his death.
Who?
No man no, why takeoff
Chaaaaa
oh no ! not rapper takeoff!!!!!lol
People in this world are so cruel!!!
Sacrificed‼️💯
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Why only rapper shot death' 😭😭
Wtf no no no
This is ridiculous. I thought LA had all the reckless ppl now what yall gotta say about Houston. People are jealous and crazy everywhere. Let's not be stupid people. Get a life and control yall jealousy.
And nothing of value was lost
So umm  where’s blm? Crickets huh? No protest? No rioting?
The people getting clout off this man so sad and sorry
Tx hard mfs from Atlanta betta stop coming down hea thinking shii sweet dis shii bad for u🤫
You have a man with this much money playing a dice game huh? 🤨
Didn’t he just get out of jail
Why didnt he just take off?
You got all that money but you still wanna live like you still in the hood SMDH!!!
I wonder if it was a white person who shot him? 🤷‍♂️
So fd up.. I'm a little older but respected this group and was def feelin Takeoff the most. Was just havin convo wit my boy about him.. 💔🙏🙏🙏R.I.P
People forget the value of a life. They act out of emotion. I bet in that moment if TakeOff would be given the opportunity to keep his life in exchange for his millions of dollars, he would've given every cent. Yet in these heat of the moment situations people act out of emotion and things happen quick and without a thought. R.I.P. TakeOff and power and strength to his family. May God help us all.
Never heard of him .. but suck to be caught up in a democrat promoted situation.
This is just a shame 😢.. way too much of this going on… come on y’all we have to do better..
Constant fighting....
Wow lol 😂 black American “culture” at it again. Hopefully this happens more and more so that the streets can finally be safe for those of us who actually want to contribute to society.
🕊️
Never heard of him until he died lol
This really fucks me up. This is a damn shame.
Dice kills! LOL!
Nobody saw the shooter smh
Versace was a pretty annoying song though ngl
Sing about it. Live the life style. Die in the life style. Self explained. Ayyyye I guess you can say it’s their “culture” lol I’m sorry but seriously when people who sing about this die in shooting it’s like bruh the fuck you expect out of your life other then death
These people are rich and famous and just can't stay out of hood life and problematic lifestyle.
I promise you its the one you least expect its crazy in the world. Will be prayin for his family
We need a ban on bowling alleys now.
'loss for hip hop' ?...They made garbage pop music
I don't know him. But if you live that lifestyle, this is the kind of thing that happens. IS this even news.
these rappers need to stay off these streets... it's like there trophies out here... rip brother
Quavo the reason he got killed, dude was emptying quavo pockets he got mad and the dudes he tryed to bug up with got to shooting and takeoff got hit.RIP🕊some say he got killed by his own people who was shooting wiled
Be safe out there everyone❤
Didn't they just get booed off stage not long ago? All they money they have and there playing dice like there in the ghetto at a party? What a bunch of 🤡
https://youtu.be/VNJT0X9IGd8 RIP TAKEOFF
Life taken way too soon for no reason. Makes me so sad to see.
Man wtf tho hmmm if u a rapper pls take care of your self's out there pls peace and love to his family
Still tryna figure out how this is white peoples fault this stuff keeps happening🤔🤔
Let this be learning lessons to all. Don't let your ego get involved in bullshit. Learn to be humble and don't get offended so easily.
I’m so disgusted
Takeoff just landed. ⭐
Died over a stupid argument and extra large ego's. Too sad. RIP
Why are you playing dice?
Exactly what Kanye was talking about and we cancelled him. No artists of any other culture on Earth suffer these fates but when you don’t own the record labels and they promote affirmations of murder, rape, and self destruction then this is what we get. A never ending cycle of death and turmoil exclusive to our “the black” community. We are slaughtering ourselves due to the influence of music that we don’t even own. Truly f*cking sad and depressing. We will march in the streets all day when a white person kills us but when a black person murders us, the BLM stuff goes out the window. NO ONE EVEN BLINKS AN EYE! We are desensitized and programmed. Why does “black life” not matter now?
Tons of people there but nobody knows nothing. This is the difference between white culture and black culture. Black people get mad when murders go unsolved and say white murders always get solved. Its cuz white people speak up and killers are caught…police arent mind readers. They arent there when the crime happens…if nobody’s talking theres only so much they can do
He finally tookoff... Damn
Where's blm?
🤣🤣
They put a hit on xxxtentacion. All of the migos stabbed/ jumped him and pulled a gun on him before he died. Karmas a mofo ain’t it.
Omggggg that is wild I am in disbelief!!! Prayers for the family 🖤
They know who shot him they just ain’t talkin “yet”
Holy shit😳
Devil came to collect
Regular Day in America Fuk Yea , Freedom Fuk Yea !!! Keep it going americans yall are showing the world what true freedom looks like . Keep at it cant wait to see the yearly death count in america yall are doing numbers <3
The devil came to collect now he's in his eternal suffering life which is hell. I'm not sure why you're all praising this man like he's your God yes showing respect is good but for the wicked they don't deserve any he was a an influencer and not a good one....
Yall still haven't learned yet!?!? Shooting dice 🎲  and you rich  Don't make sense
Rappers seem to have the shortest lifespan of any humans
Media will report this related to January 6th. Everything is Trump's fault.
Whattt!!!!
That is really unfortunate. RIP
One down two to go!! Thugs
Prayers & condolences  to his family. 🙏
Rappers and criminals go hand in hand.
This is not devastating to me they're all Street rats
BLM!!! DEFUND THE POLICE !!! VOTE DEMOCRAT!!!
Guess you can say he took off on us
Guess you can say he took off on us
Weird how all these rappers get killed by white supremacists
So what's the bad news??????
Keep selling guns USA
Disgusting
OMG
His own ppl shot him.. Keep up playing that gangster shit and gangster shit gonna happen to you. Sad situation but play the game and win the prize.
Black kill black more than any other group... Money has nothing to do with it. My people  need to be healed!
You are lying!!!!!
Guess he didn't take off.. too soon?
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭RIP tske off way out of Kingston Jamaica
Why people not from Houston want to keep coming to Houston is beyond me. Especially if you're a celebrity it's dangerous for you.
You rich why are you playing 🎲??? 2am .....nothing good happens after midnight. I'm from the streets trust a better life awaits you at home.
This is gonna go under the rug in the media because it wasn't an officer who shot him
Another one sad.
He was sacrificed... shot over a dice game 🤣🤣🤣 thata dumb. He was a luciferian freemason, when your number is called on high holidays you have to go.
Damn ! This is outrageous! WTF is going on with this world full of crime & violence! My condolences to the family & friends  😢🙏🏽😢🙏🏽😢🙏🏽
So sad RIP Takeoff🙏
RIP Takeoff https://youtu.be/SGipoAsjQ18
🙏🏾💔😓
That's how you know you've made it as a rapper. All the best rappers die this way.
Sacrificial lamb how could the brothers do this the best rapper in the group
LOL BLM members!
good thing no rap praises shooting anyone or how cool being a criminal is
Now lord infamous can't beat his ass in hell for stealing his flow.
Wow
Cardi B and offset HAD HIM KILLED 😢
Damn, RIP 🙏
Now is the time to get right with God.  Now is the time to change your life.  Now is the time to repent bc tomorrow ISN’T promised 🙏🏾
This is messed up way to young it’s coming to the point where you can’t disagree with anyone or you will get shot no one fights anymore they just grab a gun and shoot and it just keeps getting worse and worse
I’m stressed out man
Out here being hunted while playing dice
This is so sad alot of good rappers and singers are getting taken away. He was such an amazing person with a good heart rip you sweet heart.
That's the lifestyle he chose and he paid for it. He got what he knew would eventually happen
He was just sneaker shopping just the other day
Someone seen the shooter, time to snitch up and this one
That's what happens when fake Oregon gangsters go to Texas and try banging
Rapper seems to be the most dangerous occupation
He shoulda off take off!
Damn takeoff...tf quavo doin
Dude shot and lets all just stand around while the ACTIVE SHOOTER is still out there!!!   No Real Human reactions in the video!   This is such theatre for the Trash Rapper so the labels can get their money back!!!   SETUP!  SCRPIT what ever you want to call it....
You can't have NOTHING around niqqas! I swear, niqqas don't know how to act when they see another black man with money!
This is sad he was in my opinion, the best rapper in the group rest in peace takeoff
Never heard of this mumbler.. atleast though people will go protest and demand justice
WOW!!SMMFH
Thugs with guns. The most existential threat to the safety of the American Citizens we have in the USA Today.
I need to look at some statistics cause the news reports more killing in Houston than in Chicago this past year.
Probably cuz of republicans
Not surprised
Does anyone know the location of the BLM protests for this?
I cant say I'm shocked. We don't see this anywhere else and people don't even question why. How many country artists have been shot dead? How many blues or rock artists? None that I can think of. All they rap about is killing other black men and everyone is surprised when they get shot. I say fuck him.
playing dice at a bowling alley at 2 a.m with quavo? why though??  rip brother
probaly 3am
WHAAAT
Seemed like the quietest and most reserved out of the 3 ... this is very very sad 😔
Rest  In  Heaven  Take off
Young kid😢
when u spend ur money on diamonds and not security...
Damn.

Life is fragile, call upon the name Jesus Christ, the living God, and seek him and you will be saved   John 10:9  9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
1 less rapper....its a good thing😃

Smh he was the best one RIP king
"It's an evil world we live in"....
Nooooooooooo
1/3
Are you serious smh .R.I.P  so many rappers getting killed .this is sad
Quavo has to take the blame on this one. 🤦🏽‍♂️
It's real sad how killing a man today is nothing! We all gotta be judged in the end!
Migos fans wouldnt know good rap music if it came up and kicked em in the balls
Praise Jesus Christ-- repent and believe today for salvation! Amen.
RIP TOO HIM BUT KARMA CATCHES UP TOO EVERYONE LEAVE THAT THUG LIFE BEHIND
People do anything for clout R.I.P Takeoff
Damn rip
That’s cuz of Halloween this always happens when it’s closed to the holidays
It's only gunna get worse
Culture of violence
He took off to heaven. RIP legend. You won't be forgotten.
Shocking🙄
Black culture will still continue to glorify gang and gang violence.  Rappers will continue to come up with violent names and continue to rap about violence and they will continue to kill each other.  Black culture doe not value life.  Its very sad.
No back up.  And those that were there, no self awareness.  How you let your friend get it like that?
We are in some trying time right now when Life doesn't mean anything any more, we have to stay Prayed Up Evil is all around us, Rest in Heavenly Peace TAKEOFF.
NOT 1/3 HE WAS LIKE 3/4 TAKE OFF WAS ONE OF THE BEST COMPARED TO OFFSET AND QUAVO LYRICALLY
What the fk going on
White supr's once again, just as I suspected... shooting dice at 330am, you live like a thug you definitely will die like one. You can take a pocout of the getto but you can't take the getto out of one..
Damm that's why I don't go out any more it's not safe no we're.
Thug life yall! Keep it 💯!
Takeoff to the grave and feed the worms amigo
Okay........
Quavo knows something
Not even a bowling alley is safe with these people
Why he mention quavo in the end
Everyone’s a tough guy until they dead.
Texas becoming Chicago
This is big ……lost the Migos where a generational group I know there have been a bunch of killings of rappers the last few years but this one got me speechless this is the one that’s gonna shake up the hip hop community 😢😢😢
"Deuteronomy 28:65-66 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:  66 And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:"   And this will continue over and over and over! Kanye should be a wake up call to my fellow Israelites, come out of this life style, come out of sin, these gentiles have promoted your thug life rap to help influence your youth to be violent and unrighteous.
He took off alright, who is this guy, don't care
Texas and these B.S. gun laws!!!  When one of these pro gun carriers loses one of their children then they will wanna do something!  This is truly sad.
"You can be from the hood but you don't got to be hood." Ice cube said it best.
It crazy how it was at a time where you suppose to be sleep , nigga be out and doing shit
Live by the gun. Die by the gun.
When your into the music industry and demonic craft you have to give something up or the devil will take someone you love from you.
Damn
Good news, more rappers!
The only thing sad about this news is that it wasn’t all three of them ! 😒 Look at all you idol worshippers putting condolences on YouTube comments LMFAO 🤣🤣
So now we cant even play dice with white police officers, lebrenda jame
Music.  Kills. You softly!!!!
Music.  Kills. You softly!!!!

Wow. Wasn't he like the quietest of the group? Weird how life goes 😔.
Oh no this is gonna mark a revolution
Sad he was so QUITE “ Rest In Peace Bro 🙏🏽💔💔
I can’t believe it
White supremacist?
all because of hood s**t..... I thought the point was to get out of the hood and educate yourself so this don't happen?
Who cares! One less pos
Black on black crime. Oh well
Who?
Black Lives Matter.  So why doesn't black culture address the biggest issue blacks have, black on black crime?
😂😂😂😂
He ain't dead this is staged it doesn't add up
Republicans be like, the Dems did this.
Who?
All these people there and no one saw a thing 🤦‍♂️ yeah right.
Drs, nurses, accountants etc don’t die this way
Trash taking out the trash.... bravo....
Need basis of argument.  Check financial  within family members.  New thing now life insurance policies put on individuals pay debts.
My deepest condolences for him and his Familia
“I don’t mind being famous it just sucks I can’t go nowhere..gotta have everything at my house” - Steve Harvey…..when you get money you gotta be untouchable with heavy security.
Owww thought it was fake news damn people just killing if they don't agree on something horrible rest in peace.
Bone Thugs wannabes
condolences to the entire family
Ion even fw migos n newer rap fr but dddaammnn I definitely know who he is n all they’ve done, shot is very sad, more folks dead n gone, … smh rip bro
Nobody saw anything. Big surprise here.
Why aren't county artists being shot monthly?  What are they doing that the hip hop community isn't?
unexpected, damn
What happens to BLM? #Scam🤡
Hopefully we wont hear anymore of thier trash music…bunch of Bone Thugs wannabes
Oh no what ever we gonna do now
He wuz a good boy. He wuz getting his degree in engineering n sheet
Why is this surprising to anyone?  This is that gangsta life that rappers glorify!! Going out in a blaze of bullets is  standard. Hopefully Tekashi 69 goes bowling next 🤞
I don’t have a clue who this guy was 😅
Another poor dead bastard
U rich and want to play ghetto still
wow people have zero respect for life.
As a filipino i'm a fan of the migos and to me he is the best lyricist of them three. Sooo heartbreaking brooo !
Look like Takeoff done took off 👋
The more guns, the more deaths.   Rest in peace poor soul.
It's not a loss in the world of hip Hop it's a gain for Satan.. when will people understand that you're going to Hellfire for propagating promoting listening and partaking in this music... And honestly the news people are idiots for talking about all the credentials and the history of the group and so on they couldn't pay me enough to be a newscaster.
well you rap about guns gangs... drugs ... what do you expect...
Happy endings..
Oh yeah, a devastating loss! Charter member of a violent subculture. Always the same demographics.
Rappers are like gang members I would guess.
What does it take to scrap off fire arm licenses. If shootings are not in schools it’s in the streets… RIP Take off
Black on black brutality
How many black men going to be killed by our own… tell me again Ye is lying
Tupac said it years ago... "Give em guns....watch em kill each other". Broken systems produce Broken ppl. One law for All is a Flaw. 🥀🙏💖🌱🌹
Well, at least he did TAKEOFF.
Yes sirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
WHAT….
RIP Takeoff
Wtf RIP takeoff wtf he was always out the way damn.
The contract was over satan came and collected
😂😂😂 devastating loss….please.  who cares
When are people going to learn that shooting dice has hardly ever ended peacefully???
Live by the gun die by the gun.  Rap music is just glorifying violence so there you have it
Lord wrap your hands around this family😢😢😢🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
All that rap and gangs are about, who's shocked.
WTF is this real 😡😡
Well i didn't expect this would happen
Got to remember there's like 7 times more rappers than before back in the day there was 6 rappers that was top of the line now there's so many like regular people things do happen plus phones is no help when tracking where someone is
This done killed me man!...im sick this morning and woke up to this shit!...this done killed me man!...lost Von, even though he wasn't murdered my man Freddo Santana, MF DOOM, Dolph, Mo3, FBG Duck, it goes on and on in hip hop!...man I'm bout to just listen to Jazz and country music!...RIP PHEW!!!
Gang Gang mf's you worship the life.
Best Halloween ever! 🎃 💯👍🥳🤣🇺🇲
Ain’t nobody going to jail for this unless they tell dude he gotta go lay down
SMH over a dice game. RIP 🕊🙏❤️
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE PERSON PISSED OFF THAT A BLACK MAN WAS KILLED BY ANOTHER BLACK MAN.  OH, CONDOLENCES EVERYONE. BUT WHEN A NON BLACK PERSON KILLS A BLACK PERSON ALL YA;LL WANT TO PROTEST, BURN EVERYTHING DOWN AND LOOT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.  DAMN SHAME.  NOT A SINGLE BLACK PERSON PISSED OFF ENOUGH TO GO AND PROTEST THE MURDER OF YOUR OWN PEOPLE  BY YOUR OWN PEOPLE.   TAKE A DEEPER LOOK AT YOURSELVES.  DEEPER.  BLM DOES NOT MATTER CAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER TO BLACK PEOPLE.
REST IN PARADISE 😢  THIS IS SHOCKING…
Headshot at point blank range. Dude didn’t stand a chance
Nobody saw nothing Wtf?!
Bro him and quavo are cousins wtf bro smdh
Bowling alleys usually become clubs once the blacks show up aound 9 pm. That also is the case for Chucky Cheese, Dave n Busters or virtually any restaurant. Take your families home around 7:30 in case some decide to come to the club early.
Nothing of value was lost.
Starting to think the designation rapper is just a pseudonym for drug dealer. Who tf ever heard of this dude?
Smh rip king takeoff 😞
This is sad
Playing a dice game at a bowling alley? Y'all rich as heck and y'all playing dice games? I hope they had sense not to get involved in that and take off was just an unfortunate bystander. Those games usually end up in violence due to some sore loser who didn't like the outcome or a robber taking opportunity smh. Seems like if you're a rapper and you visit Houston, someone is looking to pull your card. This is the 3rd rapper I think so far that was killed in Houston.
Who?
Wtf???
Clean up your liberal cities
BAPHOMET
WHY! WHY COULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN OFFSET.....HE WAS THE ONLY ONE I LIKED OUT THE 3
Made it out the street life too get gunned down by street punks!!!!!!
⚖️  BE ASSURED THAT JUSTICE IS ON ITS WAY
The only sad thing was that he lost his life for stupid shit. I love it it how NO ONE SAW THE SHOOTER. All these phones and cameras.   That’s not hip hop music, sorry not sorry.   Condolences to his family.
Damn no Wtf smhhh
This is AMERICA
Was it the white supremacists Biden warned us about? Far right extremists?
This deadass real?
Weird Im sure these men were playing with money no security or local police wow
Takeoff tookoff
Remember, you can't say country music signers don't get shot and killed... That's racist folks
Sad when is Enough is Enough!!!!!!
THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN! The fuck PEOPLE
Why is no one talking about how Quavo was there and left him! Your nephew got shot and killed and you leave his body there like trash! Not to add this happened right after Halloween which is a known sacrifice day for industry. Even in the music video they just released the beginning is Quavo trying to “wake” takeoff up from a “deep sleep” it’s beginning to get very apparent
This is so disgusting..I'm so sorry for his family ..My deepest condolences..Rest in Peace.. TAKEOFF..😥😓🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
That's why I don't hang around with a bunch of niggahs. Too much hate and jealousy in their hearts 🤦🏾‍♂️
This so many rappers dying this year. It's sad
Another senseless death , I don't listen to modern hip hop and I never knew the deceased, but I hope that he rest in peace.  No one needs to be violently killed like this, this gun violence needs to end.
When you make it ,if you at a certain status ,you can't just be out hanging with the common folks ,they should've never been out playing dice with these thugs  , should've had they ass at home ,just too many haters out here
Damn gun violence is rampant..Especially amongst the young black rappers. This must stop Nipsey, Pop Smoke,King Von,  Dolph,Mo3, PnB Rock, ( just to name a few off my head in the last few years) and  now Takeoff..Rip
Dumb nigga smh. Stay yo ass out the hood if you're famous niggas Shooting Dice ? Wtf for ? ..idiots.
he raps about killing and now he's been killed. Go figure
Dont they rap about killing other black people. Why do they make music that is violent and then expect to not see that same type of attention?
Dudes really killed take off 🛫 why smh!! ? R.i.p man they always gotta cheat us outta good music 🎵🎶
GTFO! That was my dude! WOW!
Flakkodemiks about to go off on the mites who did this tonight.  Tune in to No Jumper, the coolest podcast
RIP TAKEOFF
Damn, sad. That’s the problem, we see this every day in the hood and where we hang out and celebrities on tv and social media every day convincing us that white people are our problem, it’s us!!!!!!
He was such a chill guy. Always stayed out of the drama. This is why im not cool anywhere near guns. A rogue bullet killed a man that was minding his own business during someone else's altercation. I unfortunately saw the video. It was just too much. RIP Takeoff
Another rapper killed by gun violence...what a shitty trend...people need to stop killing each other...what ever happened to just kicking someone's ass
RIP!!!!! We have too do better!!!!!! Get real security!!!!!
THE LORD IS A GOD OF JUSTICE.
They have camera they need to find who killed the man
He was the heart the Migos. He will be messed. They were all related so I know there family is hurting. RIP Takeoff 🙏🏽
Rip takeoff damn
I hate how people just killing people just to be killing.
Bro this is crazy. All over a game of dice?
damn!
Great news, one less racist rapper making trash recordings.
I'm not allowed to comment.
I have no idea who this is so it's not to big of a loss to computer generated sounds.
Almost sure Charleston white finna get real disrespectful smh
So so unbelievably sad . This is so messed up
If you wanna live by the sword then you will die by the sword .... Simple as that....
LOL
Wow when I heard the news, I cant lie I was shocked. He is quiet and doesnt bother anyone. He is unproblematic. You dont hear his name at all in the media.
They bash the police every chance they get but when something happens 911 is the only thing on their mind. ❤💙
Migos is hella trash. I never wish death on anyone and it sucks he died, but musically I couldnt care less
Who gives a fuck
Two niggahs beefing over dice game  isn't major news .
World full of haters. RIP to this man.
So sad  sending prayers to his family. RIP  😢
Stop it, white people!
My Condolences go out to his Family
Hey USA. Why is the Police there? I thought you don’t need them…
The first thing that comes to mind when you hear something like this is..                      Who?
Keep playing stupid games blacks
Migos perpetuated gun violence. This should be a sad lesson.
Woooow this is crazy
Dam Houston , the jeweler was killed there now this. Not good Houston…
LoL everything about this story is ridiculous.
Truly sad world we are living in, smh 🙏🏾. So now Offset and Quavo gonna #takeoff 🤔🤔
This is why I don't be around the rap culture anymore.
it could’ve been lil nas x 😔
What a culture....
Wtf is takeoff lmfao
R.I.P YOUNG BRO. OMG!!!!
🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️
BLM😒🫤
like I said before,  being a rapper is dangerous now...
an elevation in finances HAS TO MEAN an elevation in environment
who
I don’t about takeoff life, but I do know he is in heaven.
Killed for those shades…charge it to the game
"It's my own people doing all the killings here" ~ R.i.p Takeoff
I was hoping this was B's just thinking about it I really enjoyed him and the Migos sad things come to this it ain't easy being black I'm sorry but it ain't God bless his family
Wow.. RIP
I heard takeoff got accidentally shot by there own bodyguards
so sad!! so much to celebrate and instead everyone will be mourning
Takeoff officially took off. RIP
"My Spirit Guides said it was "ORCHESTRATED" "EXECUTION STYLE" "POP Him"@ 10:56 am I hear "Fam set me Up!"
Oh 😰 No it’s unbelievable
He tookoff pretty quick 🙊
Just listened to messy. It’s a shame how you Americans kill each other instead of building each other. There’s too much animosity between our race over there. Shame. Your music is all about violence and killing each other. Lifestyle scary AF. This is one of the reasons I prefer to just travel and not relocate out of Africa.
they gotta slide for takeoff bruh
👀
World series of dice Leonard Washington 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
More good guys need to hold guns to defend themselves from bad guys
dang rest in peace
I'm lost for words the way we treat each other !
Boyfriend?
Very sad day but he shouldnt have been in houston to begin with. Not a place to be in when your a rapper/hip hop artist.
‘Someone opened fire’ probably a white suprematists with dark colored skin
He was set up by his own ,Taken out by the industry , WHEN YOU STEP OUTSIDE OF( THE MOST HIGH )WILL for your life DESTRUCTION  COMES  ,STOP IDOLIZING THESE DAMN HUMANS THAT ARE IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY .THESE PEOPLE DONT CARE ABOUT YOU THEY LEAD YOU ASTRAY DOWN THAT DARK PATH THAT THEY ARE ALSO ON  COME JOIN THE NARROW PATH BE DIFFERENT UPLIFT ,PRAY TO (THE MOST HIGH) GIVE YOUR LIFE TO HIM AND HIM ONLY MANY MORE CELEBRITYS WILL BE MURDERED  IN A SAVAGE WAY FOR THE SAVAGE LIFESTYLE THEY LIVE AND LEAD OTHERS TO LIVE IN A SAVAGE WAY. ALL PRAISES TO (THE MOST HIGH ) period
Another unique voice in the rap game gone.FUCK RAP MUSIC. JACKA GONE. I'm too done.
Bro of ALL places. A bowling alley in downtown smh WTFFF
these rappers gonna have to stop going out.. this is getting ridiculous
Killed over playing dice? Wake up people!
Change the Culture
This is good news. 1 less rapping thug who glorifies drug dealing and violent crime. Not going to shed a tear over this hooligan.
Boy got shot playing dice. Weak af. Next
My mind's playin tricks on me
Who?
This is insane when you are not in tuned with the Lord this is what happens sad but illuminati will get you always  hopefully he gave his heart to The Lord if he had a chance for forgiveness or his destiny is in hell for eternity I’m not God but a true believer in Christ people need to wake up we are living in the last days in this evil corrupt world
You guys are acting like this happened out in some normal part of town. Of course it's in a pool hall. These are shitty places where shitty people go. Theres a reason that this only happens to rappers. They always wanna go back to the hood after they get jewelry and money and rapped about killing and robbing.  Takeoff really had talent regardless, but damn. These rappers gotta up their standards on where they hang out. How many more rappers gotta be killed going back to the hood or ghetto parts of town?
Rapping is the most dangerous job in the world now.... so sad..
Get the muthafucka fuk’n T-shirts with his face on it with angel wings attached & him standing in front of the Pearly Gates 😂. You know how N!66A’S do it. N!66A shouldn’t have been shootin’ dice 🎲🎲 @ 2:30am in the first place. But if you live that street life, then those are the risks you take.
BLM....
Takeoff doesn't gamble ...Quevo was shooting dice. Takeoff was just watching. Just to correct the message.
Their music a lot of the earlier stuff talked about killing no sympathy from me
Adios AMIGOS!
Rip takeoff wtf😔
WTF....HE WAS THE BEST ONE....NO NO. HE'S NEVER IN TROUBLE. JEALOUS IS A BITCH
I know OFFSET upset when TAKEOFF Tookoff..right.?😒ALL about sac REfices nowadays.
Never heard of him but R.I.P.
My son let me know this and I had to search for myself. My heart is broken like many!!! He appeared to be a quiet young man. I even followed him on IG and he was enjoying his life! I pray comfort and strength for his family and all who love him! This seems unreal!!! What happened to fighting??? No one could calm the situation??? Why our people do not value our lives is baffling to my SOUL!!!!!!!! MY GOD - you cannot mingle in every circle when you reach that status - as much as you'd love to be around your peers - the spirits of eny/jealousy are very real!!!!!! DAM
To bad his career never really got to Takeoff
If your rich you don't need to be playing a ghetto game like dice. stay away from ninjas.
Change the culture change the man. Keep pumpin the little ones with shit behavior and this will keep happening.  Stop glorifying the black urban culture as "cool" and this type of behavior stops.   You don't see Italian mob culture being pushed anymore (well except in political circles, but it's not in the mainstream)
Look how they lived their lives what do you expect going to happen to they sold millions of albums with nothing but words of hate and killing you reap what you sow.
You fucking serious bro.....
Thug culture takes another rapper out. Mainstream media won't question this and or be outraged.
Not much good is going to happen at 2:30am, in a bar, playing dice.  Probably an argument about nothing.  People are so quick to shoot these days.
Quavo at fault getting mad over a dice game at a bowling alley. I heard he was shot by a migo affiliate before them guys even started shooting back
*insert i am shocked gif
Should have took off.
That's sad man
Damn this is so damn sad..😭😭😭
Good 🤷‍♂️ hope for the same fate of all these fake “gangsters “ poisoning our youth will songs about shit they’ve never done.
Nice to see the TRASH of our society taking itself out
Rip Phew ! 🥺🖤
Only in rap music do you see people killing eachother
Bro wtf!!!! Why can’t everyone just get along!!! Life if too damn short for all this 😢😢😢. MY PRAYERS 🙏🙏🙏 go out to all the families. May god give them strength to go through these tough times.
No fucking wayyyy!
Damn shame...black people wake the fuck up please!!!
Thats a shame
Live by the sword 🗡️!!
You live that kind of life. Violence, murder, shooting one another. Package it together, and sell it. Messing around at 2:30 am on a Halloween. My mom would of said, " what'd ya expect?"
Fuck RAP MUSIC
Wtf.... Why even be in Houston.... Houston has never liked outsiders....everyone coming to Texas gets shot at... This shit was a set up 🤦
These people still live in the 90s.
As much as I hated these guys' music, he definitely didn't deserve to go out that way. RIP 🙏🏽
It was a sacrifice tf where was your brothers
Oh my God 😢 this can't be happening
This is what Kanye was talking about. They've been promoting gun violence in rap music. The people have been brainwashed to pull the trigger with ego and pride.
Texas isn't a safe place to vaca anywhere else is better than that
damn so heart breaking
damn takeoff 🛫 was taken off the list, RIP 🪦 i actually liked his solo album it was pretty good.. i do sense a sinister vibe from this situation.. what’s done in the dark will always find itself to the light..dude was too chill & successful to be playing dice games with hoodlums.. he should’ve known better.
Who cares
I was a Takeoff fan. This is truly heartbreaking. May he sleep peaceful
Oh wow!!  Unbelievable!!! When will this stop
That ain’t right
WOWWWW!!!!!
Public place, cameras, girls maybe a couple of random people, rappers with insurance on them maybe a body guard definitely cell phones with all these elements around, I don’t think anyone going to get caught, for real it’s sad man. And they did mention Qavo name let’s see how his career go from here I’m just saying those be the conspiracy theory’s. But I hope some get caught but really get caught this time
Mhm, this sounds...like a setup to me like someone had .planned this way before.  Why can't ppl just walked away from? It never makes any sense to me.
😓😓😢😢😰😰😭😭
Nnnnnnooooooo
Why are you shooting Dice in a Bowling Alley anyways? All these Boys need to Grow up.
🤷‍♀️
Rappers please stay out of Texas I literally am crying I’m tired we don’t have to worry about the white man killing is anymore we doing a good job of doing it ourselves at this point I’m embarrassed of my people this shit has to stop
I guess they took his life off.
Man this is sad
Geuss he'll never take off now
At 2 am my happy ass is in bed asleep
Never heard of him or whats megos is. But all you need to do is fix your community.. stop killing each other. Be there for your children. It's pretty damn simple
You wanna live that life you get what you get.
What a shame. His career was just about to takeoff.
Maybe if he hadn’t been a gangster (?)
I read he was playing dice at 2am? Wtf! Nothing good happens after 12 people stay home
Yet white supremacists and MAGA supporters are the problem in America. 🤣🤣🤣👌🏾👌🏾
shocking LOL 😂😆
No way
Rest in peace 😞
Sad 😢
Smh why why man why 😩
The only genre of music that does this way more than any other genre. Evil.
First off, why were people in there with guns??? If i'm famous the only people around me that can have guns are my security. These Black men are dying left and right,sad.
1/3 of Migos? More like 2/3 of Migos smh!!!! RIP TAKEOFF❤😢
why tf are yall posting this and yall are a news station from new york??? It would make more sense if it was his hometown or the city it happened in posted it but yall should take this down out of respect!
This is... is is fucking terrible... I wake up and hear this man shot what the FUCK
More blacktivity lmao
Guess this Nucka took off!   BLACK LIVES WILL NEVER MATTER UNTIL THEY MATTER TO BLACK PEOPLE.  if black lives matter, why are so many black people killing black people?  and NOT A DAMN THING BEING SAID FROM BLACK PEOPLE.  NO PROTESTS AGAINST GANG VIOLENCE AND KILLING BLACKS BY BLACKS.  IF ITS OK FOR YOU, IT'S OK FOR ME TOO.  WON'T LOSE NO SLEEP OVER THIS ONE.
#KanyeIsRight #FreeLarryHoover
Takeoff was the dopest of the group !!! This is an outrage that his life is ended. Rip - Takeoff and condolences to you families and friends 🙏 this world is sick and nothing but hate towards one another
I’ve never heard of a rapper being kllld
Damn
Houston just created a war between Atlanta an Houston
Sad but its part of the culture.
he was the nicest out the 3
I’ve never heard of a rapper being kllld
RIP KING blessings prayers for family and friends 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙👈😇
Who cares
Black culture is so toxic
🤣🤣🤣
Shits wild man this ain’t right
Too bad he didn't take off
Should've taken off and had some security
😭😭😭✌️🙏🕊️
Another one black culture is trash run black men run
Security’s we’re there but didn’t see the “shooter”. HE FAKED HIS DEATH!
HA HA HA!! his so called music sucked and America is alittle better now that that pos is gone.
Rip 🙏 take off this is crazy people are losing their mind this gotta stop
He was probably a sacrifice. Watch Quavo become even more famous now.
R.I.P  my friend, and may our lord and Savior Jesus Christ ✝️ comfort your family and friends.  🙏
Sounds like they were starting to distance themselves from Offset. Maybe that has something to do with it.
Guess he finally took off.
Rapper! Everyone's a rapper!😂😂 Actor, influencer, photographer, model, whatever.....
My dad used to tell me, nothing good ever happens after midnight. He was right. Thank God I had a dad that guided me
Dam.
The general consensus is that his own team shot first and caught him with a stray... if that's not some sort of poetic justice, idk what is.
There camera's all over that place they know who did it
😢
Wow RIP man😔🙏🏽 Almost couldn’t believe it when I saw it
BLM
I wouldn't go to Houston and party. It's getting crazier.
Never heard of him. Why are we getting Texas news in NYC
The most quiet unproblematic rapper....
Bowling alleys be mofo dangerous.
R.I.P great founder of Migos we Africa mourn the fallen niga we have nothing to say it so painful fuck this.
What a dangerous profession..
That what Guns do
Playing dice though? I’m confused…… why are you illegally gambling at that wealth level.  That’s sad. Dangerous world now and days.
This is so Heartbreaking Senseless Violence is way too common May He Rest in Heaven. This was NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN MIGOS WON'T BE THE SAME. My deepest condolences to his family💔💔💔😞😞😞
There’s a cultural problem here
Way to young to die, unfortunately none of us are immune from the violence that plagues our nation today
I hope to god that's fake!!!! Thats my favorite rapper!!!!😭😭😭
Another pack to smoke
In other words sacrificed!
Don't be dumb and gamble on a dice game in a bowling alley lmfao.. Nobody has heard of this fool.. And he was a fool
It’s a shame
This is amazing! Typical rapper with all that jewelry and looking like a clown. I bet this guy rapped about killing and raping and proud to hurt people. Cry.
You play you pay
Cop, Military, Gang Member
Great culture
This is fuckim ridiculous seriously
1 downed😮 dangerous job
I'm in Houston. Don't look for any justice for the guy. Houston is just another liberal run city like Chicago and NYC. Which means they don't give a shit about crime. They literally give bail to guys who kill cops here. Advice......DO NOT COME TO HOUSTON!!!!
Rip legend 😭
A contract hit.
Bro stay in the house the animals will attack you!
That’s the hip hop way
When will a certain group of people stop killing each other over ridiculous reasons??? Rip take off was the best member of migos.
We sure are glad he’s gone , and taken out by his own kind is even better
Most of us can only dream of the success those men have attained. Why shoot dice with hood dudes? Why not go to a casino withall that money? It's like they don't consider someone killing them over some senseless shit. RIP to that young man
Houston is a death trap for rappers at dice games and gambling halls.When certain Houston citizens show up rappers ,jewelers die.Stay out of Houston
Shootin dice at a blowing alley at 2am...not smatt
His contract was over they came to claim his soul🙏🙏🙏
Tampon wrapper or candy wrapper ?
That’s his fault for not hiring bodyguard. Should not start sht. RIP
Another Dead Rapper, teach your kids not to be a rapper.  Music industry is very very hard to be profitable.  Stick with coding getting your first job paying $150,000 a year, not a joke.  RIP.  People die everyday, dont be next, be smart.
WHAT.....
Shit hurts like I know him. I dont know him personally at all but man this a huge lost. Smmfh. Just like that he gone. Sad af bra
Yo Blam Wiki Glocktaveous!!
they sacrificed theyre worst member how suprising and no not devastinging at all
Nothing good happens at 2:30 in the morning .
Heart breaking
Enjoy life. Be happy to be alive .. life is precious
Take off is a millionaire why even deal with that lifestyle anymore..live by the sword die by the sword ghetto fab life never changes I'd be different with all that success..
RIP Takoff you will be missed my condolences to his family God bless 🙏
Nothing of value lost. Good riddance. Such a great culture.
my heart stopped when i saw this video
Offset! Lambo!
R.i.p
Rap violence better be ready for violence
A bunch of Simps nowadays, they don’t fight, they can’t fight, they just shoot each other.  Those blood sacrifices came strong on Halloween this year.
The most talented one out of the three gets killed.   Somethings not right man.
Fight at the dice game. Classic.
R.i.p 💐
And of course toxic black culture no one snitches so there's no accountability. But no it's the white police that are ruining the black community so this story will be brushed over
At the end of the day, migos split up, offset the most well known, quack the most well singer, takeoff the most well versed, who will you be ok with selling out on?. They did it to pac and his crew, biggie and his crew, XXXTENTACION and his crew😪🤌🏾. Look alive guys
And no one saw 😭😭😭😭
is this true
No one saw …. Off course.
I cant believe the best one out of group has die
Here we go again.. This world is sickening.
I cant believe the best one out of group has die
RIP Takeoff you made your mark my guy 😢
I never hear of these guys til they get killed.  It's a violent society.  Homicide is the number one cause of death for Black US males under age 40.   14 people shot last night in Chicago's East Garfield Park, including 3 kids.. they don't care who gets hit when spraying bullets at a target.
"black lives matter"
Was it a white cop?
Damn mans really TOOKOFF
Good! That's. What. Thugs. Do.  Why are y'all suprised? They knew the consequences of living a life of wickedness. I wish they get rid of themselves quicker.
Ngl. This one hits hard. He is a rapper i remember growing up with. I was there for Versace, hurrican katrina, Adios, chinatown. Damn bro...
Man he was such a great rapper and from what I’ve read a great man too
How are you takeoff and playing dice ? Lmfao
CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 🇺🇸 Posting this comment from HOUSTON (HARRIS COUNTY) TEXAS. Here is another example of the moral and social decline of this great and wonderful nation. CITIZENS if you don't think this country is in decline, then you are a naive fool.
Am literally crying 😓😭😭😭😭
Smh enough is enough  Im ready for the new world order …
Nooo
All them guns and poles they always rap about having, talking about never get caught lacking, got merked. Damn shame.
Wtffffffffffff
This is bad for the culture. When you’re world famous you gotta move like it. Broke folks who have nothing to lose are dangerous.
I don’t care how popular or unpopular you are, you always gotta keep at least one person around you that is willing to correct your actions and redirect you from making bad decisions. They could’ve taken their crew to Vegas and paid for a private Craps table and enjoyed the night. Don’t be out here putting your folks lives in danger by participating street s**t.
Young bucks need to learn to fight rather then pull a gun. But this is what happens when you have a generation of whining safe space weakness. Condolences to the family family who lost a loved one
Gee whiz!!  A rapper shot to death in Houston!! I wonder if anyone is surprised by that??     BTW the were shooting dice on a public sidewalk after midnight. Nothing sketchy there, right?
Most rappers are dying by gun violence, when is that going to stop?
They sacrificed him to Illuminati! Trust that shit! Smh. Damn! I don’t mourn for celebrities. They be in some shit they have no business ALL the time and this is the result. They die!
Takeoff just liftoff 2
Good
Sad man,just sad. Young folk, SIT YA ASSES DOWN SOMEWHERE SAFE;LIKE HOME! MAKE YA MONEY, GO HOME!
Why so many dead rappers. ?  We don't get this murder rate in an other genre of popular music.   Oh wait a minute !
Wtf!!!!!!😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Who cares. You play you pay.  These folks are dregs of society
Pretty messed up, sad to say but he won't be the last rapper to die because as long as there's guns involved this is always going to keep happening rather it was an accident or on purpose
That must mean Quavo really just witnessed his nephew die right infront of his eyes.. 😢 dam this is so sad 😞 RIP takeoff.
Who cares?
USa my dream, What a peacefull country
my 17 yo son is crying and i can't y'all
2:22  THE ALL-SEEING EYE 👁
Wow thats just terrible
Rap and Hip Hop are the only music genres that tend to have consistent repeated casualties within a certain demographic.
Police congregate at nearly every high profile event and even mediocre happenings - especially if people are outside the venue, whether as hired security or simply on duty, except when a shooting takes place.
Wow 💔
Never heard a song from him
I'm sure when they catch up with this person he's going to prison for a long time. Take a life you also lose your life going to be in prison so long just a disgrace a murderer and most of these people kill other people because they jealous or something that don't even make no sense to kill 🤔 no respect for life🕯️💔🥀
This was a sacrifice they sacrificed that man
And rap music got a lil less mumbly lol
My condolences to Takeoff!
Oooga Boooga Ooooga Boooga. Oz bee 🐝 DEMANDZIN mah RESPECT💥💥💥💥
NOTHING IS SAFE FROM RAP (REAL ATTITUDE PROBLEM)  MUSIC PERFORMERS 🎶 ? THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF RETALIATION OVER THIS? DISARM RAPPERS MATTER.
Houston is a Democratic Party controlled city. Stay away from democratic controlled cities
Omg!, may his soul rest in peace. 🕊🕊🕊
I get it but who was he really? Another rapper dead right? Two rappers killed in Detroit, rapper killed in Chicago, LA etc etc. What people need to do is stay away from rappers, stay away from any foolishness or people in the community your not familiar with.
They set that up
Rolling dice at a bowling and billiards place at 230am? Why not just bowl or play pool? No surprise here when you meddle in that lifestyle.
Someone saw who shot Take off and take person has to take Take off doesn't deserve this this thing of Black people not talking to police and reporting crimes its bullshit Take off didn't deserve this man 🥺🥺
If you have money and fame why risk your life playing dice with strangers. You gotta change your habits and adapt to a new and better lifestyle
Damn Takeoff 😞 RIP
ban pistol braces immediately!
Rap game wicked
he was probably tryna be tough with the wrong ones,...ill never understand why a millionaire would still hang in the slums playing dice for chump change
They were playing dice, sounds like a children's game
I guess he took off
he should have "took off" 🤣😅
Nooooooo
Rip
No fucking way
Its so sad because it couldve easily been offset and he got hella kids, so sad that it just happened to be a stray bullet, and now quavos gonna have to live with that forever, and quavo got in an arguemeant with somebody they tried shooting quavo but a stray hit takeoff in the head
I was am still a big fan of the migos which knowing the truth that he’s now gone really breaks me. Rest In Peace man.
Takeoffs adlibs will live on in music history! RIP TAKEOFF! ⚘🙏🏾🚀💯
Everyone there, nobody see nothing.  OK
😓 shocking
Very shocking to hear he wasn’t like that…. Damn its not safe for any rappers
Omg why does this happen
Rich and lost
Nooooooo
someone didn't miss tho ..
one 2 more to go. & the rosie perez wannabe wife of one cardi D
He didn’t bother nobody
Im so fucking tired of shit like this happening this is a motherfuckin shame why all the good artist die? Kill the real pieces of shit of the world...I wonder why my favorite artist keep dieing for? I'm upset frfr!!!!!!!!! I hope this shit is a Fucking Lie!!!!!
BLM should march the streets for this man
These nigguzz made it wus they problem
BLM, where the outrage for black on black crime?
That's what that culture brings with it.   Oh well
Crazy😭😭 Black men dying at an alarming rate 💔💔 We got to stop this slaughter
O my Jesus  this  is  a spite of envy bad mine its  an act of wickedness  very sad
Sweetheart, don't you worry, there will be plenty of other rappers to take his place.
The 1 mf in the group nobody knew but yall acting like Elvis died
Sad
Another Record Company collecting Life Insurance for a Artist they can't control....SMfh
When they rap singing popping people with guns get popped themselves.  Eventually they will eliminate each other..👍😎
A witness said it was Quavo that begun the altercation cause he was losing at the dice game and when the fight broke out one of Quavos people started shooting. According to that witness, Quavos people was shooting wild and sadly Takeoff was caught in the crossfire. They said the others shot Takeoff again but they mention Takeoff dropped from the first shot.  Ugh Takeoff had the silkiest flow of the 3
Isn't that next to the house of blues????
That's crazy may he RIP 🙏
I bet it was that pesky white supremacy that did it...What? It was another black man? Oh...he probably had internalized white supremacy  - Some liberal somewhere
CANT EVEN ENJOY A NIGHT OUT WHAT THE F
This is sad.
Gone to a christ less grave so sad
Satan collecting all his souls he's scared Jesus wins in da end
Security in the States, you're not even safe at a bowling alley nowadays, if things keep going at this rate a decade from now folks will be to scared to leave their homes, the streets will be empty, people only leaving the house for groceries, jobs and school, sad times.
Migos never gonna let this go
👁👁  THE LORD WILL BRING TO LIGHT  THE THINGS HIDDEN IN THE DARKNESS
Crash Landing.
😲😲😲
🙏🙏RIP
Dxmn dis is crazyy 😢
Man was playing dice...minding his own business.
Who said i was left off bad and boujee 🤣🤣🤣 HEADTAP
Please dont let this be true,, this is not real😭😭😭😥😥may his soul rest in eternal peace 🙏 😢 💜
Gun sells went thru the roof during the pandemic. Common sense is at an all time low. I’ve seen nothing but ppl shooting each other over arguments since lockdown and all guns were sold out in California. I think that has a lot to do wit it as well
Gun shot don’t respect no one . R.I.P.  people kill people. Very sad 🙏🏾🇺🇸
This shit is like a never ending nightmare , my best migo take off took off . That’s not fair nobody can replace him , I hope offset and quavo get together  again to keep up with his legacy
Rip take off gone but never forgotten one of the guys who changed the the game in rap
RIP and my condolences,
Can’t even go bowling these days
Haters killed him RIP
Thug life
Dice god damn we gotta do better who plays dice  worth 20 million iown get it this crazy
I saw text messages about Quavo starting some argument over something small and that’s what caused it. Hopefully they find out who did this and it says who did it in those messages too. RIP Takeoff.
Sad yo
Doesn't even make sense because did he have any real beef was he in a gang I guess not these rappers get in trouble one way or another and their own people kill them too
Rapping seems more dangerous then being a fire man
See u can tell people don’t care about life or somebody dying cuz somebody posted why didn’t he takeoff I didn’t see anything funny or a joke about that I’m tired of this this killing been going on forever so missing people n people they found babies n whole families from 30s they never found out who they r if it’s somebody watching over us I don’t know we on our own down here we gotta make it better cuz this young generation just wiping us out n why? 😢
Wow so shocking a rapper got shot no fucking way.
Rest ❤in peace Young Legend , gone too soon 😢
I don´t really listen to his music, but to die at 28 years like this.. it just breaks my heart. Even though i didn´t listen to his music, he did had a lot of talent and will be missed. I hope they get the person who did this.
America is a fail society
👁 2:22 👁  REMEMBER THAT GOD IS WATCHING US.
My GOD I cant beleive thattt whyyy
Why is it the best migo gotta go
Dice games once again
Prayers sad 😥world
Damn they really a duo now
Lol
When you rap about violence, don’t be sad when it happens.
This ghetto behavior has to stop. Literally shot over a damn game?!
RIP 😢
This is a DAMN SHAME... IT NEEDS TO STOP ON ALL ACCOUNTS.
A person doesn't get shot for no reason , tell the whole true story of what happened! There was some people in there and don't sit there and report that nobody knows who shot him or know anything that happened !!! Tired of the media reporting lies !!!!
Another day another ghetto rapper shot
Omggggg Noo !!!! This is crazy!!!
Say NO to violence smh
Unfortunately for him some of his community has that crabs in a bucket mentality, they just won't let someone rise up and get out.
🚀 Rest Easy T/O
As the world turns  🐐💨🍃
Noooooo!!!
All for the culture of violence
So sad after the beef between the group. Wish they had reconciled before he passed away. Ugh hope Quavo and Offset come together.
Were there ultra MAGA dudes??? Or, Savages?   You know.
My mom said nothing good ever happens after 2 am but Charleston White will get to the bottom of this...
I grew up listening to the Migos, it ain't going to be the same without Takeoff. Irreplaceable, RIP my brother. Condolences to the family.
Wow it’s been a lot of killing wow
Damn...this is sad..
The Industry is getting real messy out here with this satanic shit . They putting it right are face . All these rappers dying like it's for sport .
Lmao
• MARK 4:22 • LUKE 8:17  • MATTHEW 10:26 🗝 • LUKE 12:2
WTF!!!!
Supposedly no one saw anything, that no snitching ego is what kills us as a community but then after we blame cops and the law. Smh

ALWAYS RIP RIH ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ U WILL BE SADLY MISS.... YOU MAY BE GONE BUT U WILL NEVER EVER BE FORGOTTEN ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Rest in peace to Takeoff. I'm shocked. He was just on Drink Champs.
Cancel HipHop. Silence the violence.
Right to the dome! Turned his TV right off. The youth needs to stop letting these rappers fool them the streets is cold!
Is anyone seriously surprised 😮
He look like he Always minded his Business. Barely said A word Outside of Rapping. R.I.P Kirshnik Khari Ball, Takeoff.
One less we gotta worry about
Where is BLM. Why are they not protesting and burning down the businesses. Stopping traffic and blaming white privilege for his death. I’m very disappointed.
Lord have mercy this is too much 💔💔😢😢
OMG
Meh. So what? It's just your _culture_ to kill each other. No news here.
Oh nooo
Wow. Out here in Houston they are going crazy with all the crime
They take him off
Wtf
As long as Black Lives don’t matter to Black folk & we refuse to look in the mirror, this is gonna keep happening.
Rip...oh my God😭😭😭😢😢💔🙆🏿‍♂️🙆🏿‍♂️💔
No fucking way!!!
so many heads be commenting don’t even be listening to takeoff. like, without listening to his music, y’all don’t get his flow and the emotional connection that you build to him. to see him gone is really unbelievable
Shooting dice..someone losing their money..more than likely or someone trying to rob the dice game
Wonder if migos would fly to Houston and roll for him? R.I.P.
So today for breakfast I had toast topped with an egg and avocado. Great way to start the day!!!!
Ok so ik he died and all but wtf r these comments? He wasn't a saint or innocent
WHATEVER IS COVERED UP WILL BE UNCOVERED
Admit it, he was sacrificed, please help me with US$100   thank you
Governor Greg Abbot's Texas.  Gun fight every week like the old west.
According the Bible, anyone who dies as rapper, will not enter the kingdom of heaven. I wish that takeoff repented before he died.   Jesus, the divine son of God, is the only one to heaven. Whoever repents of his sins and believe in him as his lord and savior, will enter the kingdom of heaven.   But whoever refused to do so, will end up in the lake of fire on judgment day.   In that lake of fire, they will be covered and eaten forever by worms and maggots that never die, that erupt from the inside of them. And insects that never die will also be eating them forever, while they are burning at the same time and screaming and shouting of pain in the outer darkness. The fire does not burn the worms, maggots and insects. Only the people.   In the Bible, in romans 10:9-10 it said: if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by confessing with your mouth that you are saved. End quote.
Nobody cares. Another fking criminal off the streets.
NO, I'M SHOCKED YEAH RIGHT RAP IS A JOKE
RIP
His own group sacrificed him damn
Who cares niggas get shot everyday
This was obviously a sacrifice for the group ! He the only one that got shot and quavo didn't ? Yea Messy is what this is .
Out of the three Migos who has the most to gain with one member being absent???
BLM!!!!!
He was the laid back non-problematic member of the migos...just 28yrs old still had so much life ahead of him...he will be missed...condolences to his friends..fans..and family❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏..
Death comes to us ALL💔 Jesus our only eternal security!
His own crew accidentally shot him 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
They sacrificed him.  R.I.P🙏🏽
Thug life , thug death
Im surprised that all of that jewelry didnt stop the bullets..🙄
Where’s BLM now? Quiet when its black on black crime?
Damn .... wasn't he with his people  .wtf . Crazy
Have no clue who this is
Damm takeoff

C-SPAN WASHINGTON JOURNAL PROTECTING BEIJING BIDEN
Sound spooky obviously some blood demon devil 👿 sacrifice or some fake death story
“ALL THAT IS HIDDEN WILL BE REVEALED.”
Takeoff was always my favorite migo. This is just so sad.
Yea no forget all that men don’t cry cause my ass over boohooing 😢
Not my nigga takeoff, Nooooooooo FUCK😭😭😭😭😭
sacrifice 🤔
I grew up bumpin migos, being 22 these dudes were THE SOUND of a new generation of music. Takeoff really was the best out of the group, his flow and bars were just like insane. Rest In Peace Takeoff, the game won’t be the same without you in it.
LLP
Truly Painful 😢! A great loss… Consolations and peace to the family!🙏🏿
RIP Takeoff🙏,What's up with theses bowling alleys 🤔
👉 EXODUS 20:13  👉 DEUTERONOMY 5:17
Yall out here killing your brothers over dice games,; Martin Luther was right yall all ignorant and dumb asf.
Can guns finally be illegal in america, dumbest country in the world
This is a big world so why when people have an argument they just can’t get in their cars and go? Learn to walk away?
Wtf i can't believe this
Rap culture is awesome!  Millions more waiting their jail release date.
Omg…….. wow
YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT MURDER
Perfect example of Satan devouring his own FIRST! ALWAYS FIRST!
I hope they catch the bastard who killed him! Rest In Peace
When sell it... He eventually comes for it👹
Man takeoff was my favorite of migos. Rest in brother you music will forever bang in my car fam. Imma run that money up for the family. This why I’m moving outta here . People in the USA are freaking senseless. Rest in piece big dawg. My condolences
Hopefully no more mumble crap from the migos
Nooooooo
Didn't get killed for nothing
He took off alright
Nothing wrong with this coulture.....what a joke..whelp I guess Takeoff got Tookoff.
This is sad and senseless again is being said that he was shot by his own entourage by accident, but this has not been confirmed😢
So now what? F the streets
THOSE WHO MURDER WILL BE JUDGED AND PUNISHED.
wtf wrong with these rappers once you get that big paper you can not hang around the crabs in the hood bucket 🤦🏻‍♂️
Being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
SO SENSELESS that a young man had to lose his life over a dice game...there couldn't have been that much money involved🤔
Dangerous career choice,  in general.   How many times do other sorts of musicians get cut down for anything?
Deepest condolences to his family & loved ones
R.I.P legend 😭😭😭
He took off
You can’t be living normal when you’re that big
My condolences to his family….Loved this guy! Rest In God’s Power, Love & Peace TakeOff!🙏🏽
America need Jesus I love the 3 of them rest well bro
WTF
Strrriiiikkkkeeeeeee!!!!!
Smfh this sad af to wake up to my dawg was positive af
ANYONE WHO KILLS WILL BE JUDGED IN COURT.
Forget firefighting, military or law enforcement,  rapping is by far the most dangerous profession.
Damnit!!!
Live by the sword ⚔️ die by the sword 🗡 🩸 🪦
I love you takeoff and RIP! God, I'm do sad this happened! God!!
😢😢😢😢😢
Nooooooo 💔💔💔💔💔💔
Houston has gotten out of hand this year way too many killings and shit is only going to get worse
So much haters
This is heartbreaking!!
Omg!!!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭
Quality Control Music=111 and he's dead November 1 also written 1/11 or 11/1?🤷🏾‍♂️🍻🍺
Never heard of him...
I just found out! I am in shock! I don't feel safe anymore, at all. I don't trust anyone. We are so emotional and snap snap easily over the tiniest of things. R.I.P Takeoff This just can't be over dice. Naw, it has to be deeper than that! How do you kill someone over some dice game? How does anyone get so emotional that they lose themself like that? God help us all. No one is safe anymore.
A rapper killed by thugs that live hip hop culture lifestyles?? Say it isn't so. How could this happen? smh
Darn wtf why Takeoff this why the rap game ain't what it use to me
WHOEVER MURDERS WILL ANSWER FOR IT IN THE COURT.
Oh shi! I'm in the A. Its going to be a sad day today when news gets all the way around. RIP 🙏
Bro that’s why they needed to be together thats take off they just keep on killing are black men he was not a violent individual really I’m in a outrage it never seem like he was supposed to go out like that come on bra I’m sick of this shit
How much hatred can there be in someone to kill just for killing? 🙏
WTF
So sad 💔
Wow
Why are people shocked? The individual may be quiet and humble but the circumstances he put himself in and the system and culture of violence that he moved in doesn’t always distinguish between the docile and the belligerent. As a man, you safeguard yourself and your family by not placing around or by removing yourself from those who are prone to violence. He grew up in the hood. He knows when there are potentially violent dudes around. It’s sad, but it’s not really shocking given the propensity for violence among black men. We do it to ourselves all the time.
Unfortunately, these men are controlled and run by their emotions. People can not agree to disagree anymore.
Ain't NO (again..) NO telling where that shot.came.from.  Cameras everywhere when looting occurs.
What the hell is going on in Houston? Maybe rappers should stop going to this city all together.
Noooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!! 😢😢😢😢😢😢
ANY PERSON WHO COMMITS MURDER WILL BE JUDGED.
Rip to takeoff
I can’t believe it. This doesn’t even look right wth
Wtf
Rip man he was such a good man
Noooo
Rapper takeoff took off to go be with satan
I'm soooo shocked!  Bet it was one of them who-white supremacist I keep hearing about.
STRIKE
Fighting over pennnys cause of a dise game.
Damn not the migos Fam

“A MURDERER MUST BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL.”
Who???
They keep killing each others 🙄 where’s Black Lives Matter ? 🤡
Whatttt??! This is shock for me. Thought I was still dreaming. What a morning. RIP
My your soul rest on in peace.
Hope he was right with God.
Nothing good happens after 12am. Doesn't matter who you are. Remember that while being out.
Sheesh
He was my favorite cause he was lowkey and stayed out of trouble.  RIP man, I'm sorry this is how it ended.
From weezyanna fest 6 on Saturday to died today this horrible though
Some dumbass decides to shoot Takeoff but not take it a man like wtf 😒. I hope they find that guy
‘WHOEVER MURDERS SHALL BE GUILTY BEFORE BEFORE THE COURT.’
F man.
Omggg RIP!!!!
Damn RIP that’s messed up
Man I rather sell crack then to try an pursue a rap career!! To my young people TAKE THIS AN LEARN FROM IT BC TAKE OFF IS QUITE AN DONT BOTHER NOBODY SO IT'S FUCKED UP

white peoples fault...clearly...
Blm 🦗 s
Give thanks for life and always enjoy the like you have .
RIP
Otherside of America
I live south of Houston and have my whole life. And I absolutely hate going downtown to much crime and thugs.   We were at a wedding and on our way back home, had some guys walk out into the street and tried to box us in to stop. And they were not in any need of help if you get what I'm saying. They saw us coming down the street, and when we got closer, they all ran out from under an over pass trying to block us. I just laid into the gas and swerved onto the sidewalk. It was just me and my wife around 11P.M.   So I stay away from the city as much as i possibly can.
No one safe in the music industry this is just sad
😞 💭        Why? I ain’t surprised after all…       This is why African & West Indies have no respect for Black🇺🇸. They’re just THUGS who mostly don’t take any advantage/opportunity🇺🇸providing, only glamorizing/grooming/idolizing GANGS lifestyle, violence, drugs, strippers, prostitution, killing one another, fags, street credibility, burglarizing, destroying law abiding citizens life+getting away with it.
Texas.  That's all you need to know.
Dudes music was absolute ass but damn, killed over a dice game at 28? Why we always killing each other over stupid shit?
🕊
takeoff already
My God!!!! RIP
Soon pissed
Somewhere, a powerful democrat is smiling. Those who know, have left the democrat party. Those who don't, continue to suffer and knowingly, or unknowingly, help to spread the suffering.
Y’all act like this is a surprise. All rappers die the same
Anyone Shocked!!!. With ANYONE with a damn name like Takeoff… you stand a chance of getting TOOKOUT at any minute!!!!… oh yeah… Al Sharpton?… where you at?!!!. Hmmmmm???
Houston you have a problem  My deepest condolences to all families and fan’s
THE WICKED WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED
RIP king, just woke up to this and still can't believe it's true. You will definitely be missed but not forgotten.
LOLOLOL Hip hop fans killing hip hop artists LOLOL
RIP
One less rapper. Yay!!!!!
Set up someone is getting paid
💔💔💔
Drive is out if control because of democrats focus in abortion instead of crime.
THEY SACRIFICED THAT MAN
Nothing good happen at a dice game .
Guess he got taken off lol
Well when you live in that world you kinda deserve it
Welcome to obamas America
👉 DO NOT KILL  👉 DO NOT MURDER
I blame this J. Prince... what happened to "this is my city"?  Rip takeoff..,🙏
🤦 news reporter saying it's a tragedy come on when you promote violence drugs and prostitution what do you expect the outcomes to be for yourself 🤔🤣🤣
People egos and running their mouth 😒
Why didn't Take Off, Take off?  Momma
WHAT A CLOWN
May god welcomes him in the paradise.
Rappers need to move like 50cent always have his head on his shoulders bodyguards all around
good riddance ! keep up the good work making America great
Dam even the good ones die for no dam reason
Woah…
Another life lost to the lifestyle the white elite promote to make money off black people.  May Ra be with him. Don't let them infiltrate your mind.
Wtf
IT IS FORBIDDEN 🚫 TO MURDER,  AS IT SAYS “YOU SHALL NOT MURDER” (EXODUS 20:13, DEUTERONOMY 5:17).
Another one, thought that after pnb this was going to decrease.
Playing dice
Over a dice game. They say it was once of his people who shot em
Wow wtf 🥺😭
RIP young man 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Im not even a fan of The Migos, but this one is rough. They've been around for nearly 10 years. I didn't like their repetitive music(which others came around & did the same 1 to 3 words thing after Migos took off with Versace), but I can sympathize with them.  Two of them are cousins, one of them is the uncle. Takeoff was one of the cousins. Growing up, me, my lil bro,  & our three cousins grew up like brothers, considering all the times we were together(not just during the holidays), and we & our uncle spent so much time together.  So yeah, this rapper death hits home. R.I.P Takeoff.
The Devil is coming to collect.  Jesus Christ Yeshua Hamashiach is the TRUTH, the WAY, and the LIFE towards salvation.  Seek Him while He may be found
And the black community is in an uproar over Kanye..."he's against black people because he wore a white lives matter t-shirt"!!! What about stuff like this. I can almost guarantee you the person who killed this man is of the same race as him.. WE are our own worst enemy! We continue to kill and devour each other!!! When will we wake up?! When will we do better for ourselves?! Black life only seems to matter when it's someone of another race doing the killing!!! Condolences to his family and loved ones. #RestInGloryKing
Now he gonna Takeoff to the afterlife 😆
Sounds like little babies with guns that can’t fight worth shit. Back up your words with fists smh
Hey man!! Please tell me this is a LIE! Please tell me another brother isn't ten toes up because of a sucka?! A dice game.....well that's my hope in some people.  Keep family close and stay out them haters way. If you can take a life over something petty...YOURS isn't worth living now is it? May This Murderer recieve just due for his work LORD!
Black on black crime
Aww, some thoughts and prayers will fix him right up. That always works, right? What a fantastic start to my day! ROFLMFAO
My God 😢 😞
This is why celebrities dont go out in public cause mfs are just blood thirsty for some reason
WELCOME TO TEXAS
BLM THOUGH RIGHT?   Fuk outta here!  We killin our damn self.
Fishy
I love this, when guys who act tough get laid down.
broooo what  😥
RIP, another rapper. Happening too frequently
Sounds like good news to me. The more rappers down the better.
BLACK LIVES SPLATTER
RIP 😢
More like grounded🤣😂🤣😂❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️
If you we could understand his last words
This is a dark day for America.....Great loss ....they should lower the flag at the white house....
This is America
He got killed in my city. They don’t know who the shooter is??? How devastating 😢😢😢
This is news ? Such enriching culture
That's sad. From the streets and back to the streets. I hope our black youths are seeing this and learning something from it. These are the kinds of people they worship. There is nothing for a black man in the streets but death. Stay away from the streets and liberal and blue cities of drugs, guns, poverty, hate, and death.
ROFLMFAO rap kills. Don’t rap.
Black on black crime gotta stop, we losin too many young artists and rappers. PNB now Takeoff
Hip hop, rock, jazz, 95% of country, is truly satanic.
This genre is demonised 😒
Shocking! Omg he was so chill. Gosh dam those heartless idiots should just leave this world themselves! 🌎 🌏
• THOU SHALT NOT KILL  • THOU SHALT NOT SLAY  • THOU SHALT NOT MURDER

What you mean I was left off bad and boujee?, I wasn't left off bad and boujee. Gone to soon.
Rip Bro
Bullshit somebody saw something
Stop the violence increase the peace
The rap community needs to speak up on this issue. It keeps happening and all you see are the next rapper shot dead on a t-shirt or a post saying "he died too soon". I feel like the biggest rappers are only perpetuating the violence that's being brought to the rap community. They think it can't happen to them. We need to stop condoning this violence with another R.I.P post like we are worshipping the death and actually say something to the leaders in rap. Imo
Wow. This is wild.
This one hurts. R.I.P takeoff
That's GREAT.
What???
Bro was so chilled
Who?
Dam no more Migos union anymore
That's devastating  😓🙏
That's truly sad. He seemed like a nice guy. Very sad to see.
Bruh I didn’t even know quavo was takeoffs uncle bruh
WOW IM SAD TO HEAR THIS RIP TAKEOFF MAN!!! 🙏🙏 THIS HURT MY HEART 🤔🙏😥🥺😟
SACRIFICED
Unbelievable

No one ever sees the shooter 💀
R.I.P takeoff 🙏🙏
👁👁 2:22
Another one bites the dust
This is heartbreaking
Wtf stop playing
C'mon brother man. Why you playing dice in the hood? You're suppose to be past that and preaching it down. Another black man who was a leader is now gone. :/
I'm shocked
Listen no rapper is safe today. Being a rapper is worse than committing heinous crimes nowadays. Why don’t people just stay inside?
2:22
I went to elementary school with Takeout. He was cool funny kid back then. One time back in school 1st grade. Me takeoff and our friend Joe started food fight in the cafeteria. RIP Bro 😢
Who the hell is take off
God you have to love Black culture. How many rock stars are killed every day and every year? Fucking black culture but don't forget  black lives matter! 🤣🤣🤣 Only if it's a white person killing a black guy that way everyone can profit off of it but if it's black on black that's some broke ass murder  Al sharpton MSNBC CNN don't care about that you can't sell Tylenol commercials when a black guy kills a black guy what are you guys fucking crazy know Your role
That's horrible imagine watching your nephew get shot to death, especially one you are that close to.
this is so freaking sad to me. RIH
Waaaaaaaaaa
Damn
Nothing good happens after midnight
Wow rappers r becoming an endangered species SMH
What could go wrong during dice game lol
Don't gamble in Houston, RIP Duke the Jeweler RIP Takeoff
It was a sacrifice
I feel so bad for black people. Like are u fucking kiding me ? What do they have to go out in bullet proof clothes head to toe? FFS let them live and be in PEACE
We need to stop these KKK members from killing these young black men
My condolences to group family wife and children of this man.
Let us seek the lord Jesus Christ….. it’s bad out hear.  Man heart is desperately and deceitfully wicked Man must strive to take on the characteristics of Jesus Christ
This is a setup over the rap contract. The n****** were breaking up and it was only going to be two of them. This is about money. Not a m************ dice game. Do not let these people put the f****** Bell over your eyes
They just killed his body not his soul. Rest well bro 😴
I prefer late term aborted myself
I know he was someone's son someone's brother and probably someone's dad.. My heart goes out to his love ones  But don't sound so dramatic over something that is known to happen when you sit there and continue to sing about violence and pretend to live in that life of violent and have that lifeStyle something bad is going to happen it's not something to be overdramatic about my opinion Gangsters are waste on society anyway..
Noooo no no
But Charleston white the problem right.... SMH This man had no negative energy about him and look how he end up...
holllyyy crap
Wtf you mean nobody seen who did it ,aww naw give a mint the streets gone talk on this one .watch ,so the mf who did won't get far ,that mf scared for his life right now.thats sad shit we can't have nip,pack,him,von,juiceworld,prince,moe3,koby,nobody mfs are sad man,and again if you are a celebrity keep your mf security you are a star Yiu shine bright so you not easily missed man ,got to do better ,foreal.
Ain't no way
Was it his own people that killed hom
Yrn Takeoff eiiiiish it's unbelievable that you gone bro. 😭😭😭😭
It's getting to the point where if your a rapper, your life expectancy is about 30 years old! That's very sad! RIP!
#BlackLivesMatter
As an older rap head my condolences to the rest of the migos and the family...may god give them strength in this time of sorrow
Gotta move smarter guys it's a reason Warren buffet Elon Jeff bezos Kevin oleary look homeless on the streets..
It's funny how everybody gets on social media and act so naïve. "OMG, over a dice game". Takeoff was shooting dice (which the Migo gang ALWAYS does) probably with strangers who are drunk, high, obviously strapped, we all know what that recipe is. I'm not shocked that it happened, I'm shocked that is happened to him.
Sad, but this is what this genre promotes! And everyone wonders why blk on blk violence is outta control. Big tech can hide it all they want! It's still happening! Wonder how many died in Chicago this weekend!
The industry got him🤫
Rest in peace Takeoff. Never forget.
SPIRIT OF THE ANTI CHRIST IN UM DISEMBODIED
😢
They just killed his body not his soul. Rest well bro
I don't know why dice games amongst us black people never ends well.
Mumble rap will never be the same.
How nobody  don't know what happened out side that epic center building ( bowling alley.) Why would you be doing that after everyone  left. And you rich and famous. ( Halloween, sacrifice). Don't make sense.
RIP man what a legend takeoff was   condolence to him family n friends what a cruel world we live in
Let’s see if BLM has a single word to say about this. Of course not, they don’t care about black on black violence. Only creating a hate narrative against white “racist” cops. Pretty sad when you don’t care about your own people killing each other off.
😲 wow damn that's fucked up
yall praise anybody but jesus
I can't fcking believe this
He wonts be rapping no mo yo!
No cameras....🤔
😭😭😭
good, one less (you know what) we gotta worry about
Who?
Sacrifice 🥱
Wow… they weren’t even going hard anymore… wtf😢
Nooo fucking way
Is that a STRIKE?
This news broke my heart 💔😢
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
R.i.p
Damn Rip TakeOff
Would also like to give a shot out  To fentonal Floyd  Rest in power
TMZ has def sold their souls, always breaking news.
Black on black crime smdh
Who’s next?
Gotta be more scared of your on kind then white people
So sad how our race just kills.
This is so sad....he was the underrated one!!!! 1 Love
Dam
R.i.p brother. When you're a big name rapper or not you have to move differently, have security, go to places where this foolishness doesn't happen.
GTFO BROOO my god people need to chill out
Where is BLM now??
First MF DOOM and now Takeoff goddamn how many rappers are we gonna lose
Way to evolve as a rapper, so typical
Rest in peace takeoff... Offset
Believe in Jesus Christ and call upon His name while you can. Heaven is really and eternal But so is the lake of fire too ... BELIEVE AND REPENT EVERYONE FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS NEAR
Hopefully, Quavo and Offset will start the process to make amends with each other…RIP Takeoff 🛫🕊️
All family but it's beef this is freaking sad ASL. It's not making sense with all these senseless killings. You gotta stayed prayed up there is no other way staying prayed helps u make better decisions 2am something in morning why this late in the morning why the choice of being around these people who u may know may cause harm? What is this world coming too??? Quavo knew better why would he jeopardize Family at that he was suppose to be his protector Take off died for no reason😢😢 Now Quavo gonna have to live with the fact all these things he started the separation of real family was it worth his Nephews life Be careful what u do and how u move out here these streets ain't safe. RIH TAKEOFF♥️🙏🏾💯👆🏾😢
Dang
Rip
I bet Charleston white would’ve seen and said who shot him …
Damn
damn....rip . sad day
i cant believe you mindless idiots still believe this stuff is real and that these people are real people when they are not lol they're just playing a character its literally like a joke at this point
This is really heartbreaking  this man was a huge influence in trap
Normal thug life. Rapper equals coke heads and guns. What happened to regular R&B, Tempations, 4 Tops, . What's wrong with the kids these day's.
Sorry he was killed but honestly who cares?  This is a nobody with no career and no exposure.  Give me a break.
something here sus. noone seen anything out of a whole crowd with plenty of cameras. he had different opinions politically. definitely a-part of the agenda.
They say blm but there full of lies
Who?
Rip maybe yall mfs should get real jobs and leave that rap demonic bullshit alone
😢😢😢😢😢😢
Black on black violence
Takeoff is blasting off to another world now
No fucking way dude!
That insurance money smh
Dont listen to rap but ive definitely heard his name on media a lot and some of his songs. Sh*ts hard to comprehend
Tragic man. That's why I stay tf home. I know they gotta move around, that's their job, but man
Texas... obviously
Wtf
This is unbelievable. Sending love and prayers to the family 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Don't know him but RIP
Tragedy fuels rap.
#REGULAR💩 I don't pretend to care!! 🤨
I think when your in the entertainment industry you should watch where u go and who you roll with.
The herd thinning itself
Masonic hoaxery
Damn shame
I guarantee this is his record company's doing, so they can collect an insurance policy.
Good job with the defund the police rhetoric
it's too violent out there
iwasnleffoffbadnboojee
13%
Quavo is the one to blame for this senseless death. He was the one playing dice and got into an altercation that got his nephew killed. A rich guy playing dice with dusty niggaz like WTF!?
R.i.p
Why was he shot?
Sad when anyone is killed needlessly,  but rap music will be fine considering Migos are one of the least talented rap groups and there music was overall terrible.
Great culture
Let me quess a trump supporter
No one is safe in America 🇺🇸! The place where everyone seems to admire and dream to go. I guess you gotta have a will ready coz you don’t know what is coming
this is crazy, its my first time actually feeling pain for a rapper, I grew up on migos music bro, this is crazy
These guys are MULTIMILLIONAIRES...why TF are they shooting dice at 2:30am. And to be shot by his own homie!! DUMB SHHT STG
What!
He was the quiet one I'm so sick of these rappers dying
My deepest sympathy to his mother and family his grandparents and siblings cousin and all of his friends and fans this is truly a loss for us all....avoidable and tragic stupid no good wanna be men not even fit or taught or learned enough to be called anything more than a male individual shot and killed shooting and killing leading by example stop gamblin yall! You got extra money give it to free the brothers and sisters in slavery in Africa or India or Mexico or China or Russia or Armenia or Korea or Brazil or Puerto Rico !
Another one? Not a good time to be a rapper I guess
Bro why you even playing dice
🙏rip
My fav out the group.. RIP
Damn
Its the culture
Rip my btother  takeoff
Let me guess it was over a girl…or a chain…or a diss…
when you get rich ...move out and settle down with a nice snowbenny  and have some snowkids if you keep hangin with these people they gonna kill you..they want your money and life.

I guarantee he probably jumped up in front of Quavo, Takeoff was just too cool man... RIP😢
Couldn't shed the past unfortunately
That's sad af
😢😢😢
What’s even more sad is that takeoff was the quiet one of the group, he wasn’t even supposed to get shot, one of their crew members started shooting after quavo got into it after a damn dice game, the shit wasn’t even that big of a deal and one of his crew members started shooting and accident it hit him in the head, and the other dudes fired back and shot takeoff again… a lot of people said his body dropped after the crew member shot.
Legendary
So Sad💔💔 Rest In Power ❤
Allegedly caught in crossfire over a dice game. Hit by his man’s then the other guys
This fool ain't no legend. Hahahah.
Yoooo!!!wtf!!!🤨😖

I thought Takeoff was the uncle and Quavo was the nephew
Man this is so sad😢😢🙏
RIP Young man.

TTTAKEOFF🕊
This is crazy. November 1rst. What a sad day. R.i.p. to this young man. The gun violence is definitely getting out of hand.
This sad, bro. Rip. Just was thinking about your song last night
People need to realize you no mattee where you go, especially in city areas you need to always keep your head on a swivel, especially if your famous. Texas is like california of the south. Though its a large and beautiful state when you go into crime ridden areas dont assume it more lax than some of the rougher looking areas in america because bad areas are in every state. R.i.p brother
Kings killing each other like dogs in the street wat are we doing
Who?
he must have ran his mouth to the wrong person. money can get to your 🧠 and make you think you’re invincible 👀
This is freaking crazy I was just telling my sister I got a dream that a rapper is  going to die! 😢now look at this he is so young STOP 🛑 the gun violence we talk about black life matter we are killing each other for what I am sick of the killing that is taking place
RIP A LEGEND 😢😢
Y man 😭😭😭😭😭😭
No one knows who did the shooting ? The blk community needs to get its act together. How long is it going to take to civilize these people...
RIP , condolence to the family.
Another sacrifice ritual. Now watch who's career takes off.
Omg what?? 😭
OMG. 😢😰
Rap Musics lyrics are so violent. Then you add in the fact that black on black crime is the #1 killer of black males... this kind of stuff is bound to happen.
Set-up, who, what when... Freaken sad 😢
Very sad I know his family is in pain,  I'm sure it was couple of idiots who think they are thugs and gangsta, yet they shoot and fight for petty things worst than children... it's soo embarrassing and pitiful ..so sad some of these people are jealous too and don't mind killing folks with fame and money , I hope they catch the clown soon
This Era not surviving to b the next hip hop og's sad,condolences to the family
Damn wtf
Jealous ones always envy. The hate is real.
Is rapper considered the most dangerous profession?
Wow this hurts
Nothing good happens after midnight. Rip
Lhh damn rappers!! Threw his last strike. Shooting dice at a bowling alley
Set Up gemini like tupac..they set him up evil
Black Lives Matter ✊🏿
Boy wtf??! Never g.! I know the world is definitely coming to an end and every second is getting even scarier and scarier rest in heaven Takeoff 💯😒🙏🏽🤦🏽‍♂️😳🕊️
This all seems sketchy that no one saw
No Blm in sight or riots
Another of haters in Houston Texas.
Wtfffff
After the midterms, Biden needs to make gun control his signature legislation. The one signed a couple months ago was a good start, but we need more
RIP Takeoff…💔 Hope those responsible are caught. My condolences to his family.
Houston have got so bad
Blacks are so jealous of anyone who gains success and wealth
the streets dont love nobody
RIP takeoff.. they took another legend from this world' 😥 I hope his brother survived. #riptakeoff
No f'n way!!!! My favorite outta Migos.😔rip
Sad

Dice games are and instant argument
Planned,its always tmz that knows first ,fucking sus
This is bs I’m rioting!!
Doesn't every bowler make sure they also pack a gun before they leave the house to go bowling??? The absolute "bizarreness" of that world of hip hop
I'm tired 😫.  How many more will have to die for things to change. My favorite migo rapper may he rest in peace.
Holy shit! R I P dude 🙏🏻
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Even though I wasn't a big fan of the duo, R.I.P big dawg.
HOOLYYYY
He’s was not that good
Why do these "rappers" have such lame ass names? Another senseless murder....
Smh
This is what happens when you talk about money, sex, violence and drugs in every single song you make. Are we really surprised? Is this truly shocking? Now there’s one less hip-hop rapper in the world spreading their worthless “Hood life”, drill/trap rap nonsense through this sewage hip-hop music that is corrupting a already hopeless generation with lyrics about “All I do is F_ck b!tces” “throwing money in the club every night’ “I’ll kill you if you touch me” “I stay strapped with guns everyday” “All I do is be in the hood” and nauseatingly repeat the N word 100x in every song. But……I do wish Takeoffs family all the best through this tragic time in their lives. Death is death and every family feels it all the same.
his preferred pronoun is now, Tookoff...
😢😢😢
Damn I'm just tired of y'all haters man it should be instant death soon as you start hating on someone..rich  people should never play dice with them broke ass people.knowing you rich and they was on the block all day to get they money.shit dont add up they will always feel you winning already anyway because you rich..they could be taking all your money all night soon ass you take a couple hundred from them they mad now..smh only casino's for me
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
OH NOOO.. NOT TAKEOFF LOL😂😂
You can be famous now days and prosper but it’s the attitude within and the hate surrounding that individual that seem to dim that fame real quickly.
we are the children of Israel APTTMH repent
Over a game of dice?  A game dice?  But black lives matter.  I think we (blacks) need to quit talking that and start acting that.  I mean over a game of dice.  You gotta be kidding me.
Takeoff really was on peaceful time. One of the few just on positive vibes. This is so ridiculous. Rest In Peace.
Of course nobody saw anything 🤦‍♂️
Rest In Peace, TakeOff.
Houston PD still using Crown Vic’s that’s amazing!
Atl to flint
Damm!!!
So they were gambling and a bitch lost and became an instant punk and pulled a gun
Y'all rappers going to learn bro Stop doing dumb stuff and putting yourselves in vulnerable and dangerous situations. You worth millions and STILL trying to keep it hood...man I feel bad for take and his family..but y'all rappers better smart'n up
Damn no bro
Over a damn dice game 🤦‍♂️
I wonder if 4 law enforcement agencies showed up like they did for Pelosi's husband who was not killed 🤔🤔.??? RIP young man. 💔
Wtffffff rip bro😢

I thought it was white ppl killing blks? lol
Lol
May he rest in peace , condolences to the family
These days every body wanna be badman and gunman. Nobody wants to say sorry first. I am so tired.
😳 this is very shocking.
Funny
RIP. All these rappers are dying way to young it’s allways a result of drugs or some sort of shooting or then being murdered.
Quavo sacrificed him
Man fuck this bullshit I'm done innocent love being taken now r.i.p takeoff you don't have to live in this fucked up world no more
I assume BLM and supporters will take to the streets any minute now
Great newz. Cutty tried to act hard and found out he was soft
Quavo knows.
Sad man!!!
R.i.p🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🕊🕊🕊💔💔💔😥😥😥😥
No no no no no ☹️😭 Takeoff was the hardest and toughest of the group because he was an animal and a beast 🥺 my condolences to his family, loved ones and his peeps that are directly affected because of this immediate and unfortunate loss. 🙏🏻
What are you going to say to Saint Peter???
No!
Melly killed while dicing also. The ocean has many sharks , just stay out the water.
Wow I can't belive this RIP 😭😭
Aspirin rapper seems like a short lifespan, kinda like an underwater welder.
I can guarantee if he was shooting dice in Monaco he'd still be alive, Rappers need to stop hanging around hood/street people.
I bet was another black guy Who killed Takeoff
Can't even go out anymore if ur famous.
Oh My Dear God Lost A lot Of Young Hip Hop Artist And Young Actors Too Rest In Peace 😪😪😪
What no way. This is awful. Just senseless.
People are haters and can't stand to see ppl doing better then them, that's what all this is. Ignorance, lack a self worth RIP Takeoff, he never hurt anybody man!!!
There's a lot of MAGA trash talk. He wasn't in the dice game, and didn't involve himself in gangs or even rapped about that. Sit down and think deeply before decide to judge, didn't your God command you not to?
He’s not just a rapper he has a family this is very sad
One of migos is gone😭😭 RIP takeoff😪😪😭😭😭
Those damn white supremacist killing da bruffers.
This shit stupid to me. He a multi millionaire and you playing dice in the hood. If you make it why you go Back to the gutter and then get smoked. Rip to him. I feel bad for his family!   I hope ppl learn from this type of shit.
When u are no longer a regular person U can not do regular ppl things.
May he rest in peace
Hey rappers STOP going back to the ghetto  When you make millions thinking your boys are still your boys   When was the last time you saw a rich white famous guy go through the inner city without some security detail DOESNT HAPPEN  cause black or white when you are that famous and wearing the amount of jewelry  That somebody’s house is worth on your neck and wrist your going to anger people Your going to get robbed or killed  If that makes you feel like a sell out sorry  I’d rather be a rich sell out then a dead victim
Rip someone’s gotta pay
I bet everyone took off
wait wtf 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💔💔💔
Bro... He was one of the few new rappers to actually have talent. He was actually talented.
🎲🎲
WTH
R.I.P. mister Mumble Rapper guy. I wasn't a fan of your music but nobody deserves to die over something stupid. Didn't Proof get shot over a game of Pool??? People dyin' over the dumbest, pettiest stuff.... It's sad.
Take off officially took off.  RIP
🙏❤️😥
The most dangerous occupation in the world right now is to be a rap artist it seems RIP
migos will never be the same
Rest easy Israelite...I pray for your families hearts and may God protect them in this time. Amen
Rest In Paradise 💙 4ever 28
It’s insane how quick people are to resort to violence. Killed at a bowling alley? A place where people are supposed to be having fun. So tragic.
He looks like a respectable citizen, I’m actually shocked… lol
This is truly devastating news. Life is too short for such senseless violence.   I hope he and Offset were able to resolve their differences before his passing. If not, I can only imagine his anguish. 🥺😢
Takeoff is gone 😭😢🙏💔💔😢😢
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
this is unbelievable... why do we keep losing rappers like this.
When will black people realize that Black Lives Matter!
Damn Takeoff was my favorite. He was always cool and laid back😥
You can’t be serious!
I can no long see you in my eye Or touch you with my hands but I will feel in my heart forever 😭 takeoff I love man you will be legend forever 😭😭😭 R.I.p
No bodyguards where were they
Another 1 smh
Does anyone know Takeoff's pronouns? Need to know for the sympathy card.  Rest in peace
Wow wtf???
So sad. Gone too soon😢. RIP
I don't think takeoff is killed I think it's all staged all rappers have to die.
He was my absolute favorite! The only one out the group I followed on IG rip my baby 🙏🏿
The Big Cities are not safe after dark! Vote them all out and start fresh next week.💪🏻🇺🇸
Takeoff done tookoff ... to the great beyond.
Hé took off..
My son woke me up and told me smh I literally cried because he wasn't problematic and he kept to his self made good music😩 it's a sad day
So sad one of the best
Ai was just saying that the migis spilt was dumb they family bet you offset wish he could've seen em one last time SMH
It was alot of people there but no one saw who  shot him. They really want us to believe that.
For all of he blood that has been spilled over rappers and those who profit deserve 100× worse.
Don’t go to stupid places, where people do stupid things.  I don’t even go to public places that often because I know how ignorant and violent people can become.
No cctv footage ???
No no please no wtf is going on, I can't do this shit anymore......
Sick
Ahhh that's too bad...
Houston Texas tex ass 💩🌈 Houston rockets 🚀 it's time for takeoff Assopoopely Amazing WOW
All that money and your ass in a bowling alley at 2 in the morning dont make no sense. Nothing good happens after midnight. Really fucked up though he was a solid dude and the best out the group. Never heard about him starting shit or getting in trouble
Wow i just saw them on drink champs and they both seemed so happy and ready for life man this really hurts life just plays to much RIP TAKEOFF
Who??????
Probably killed with by a gremlin out on cashless bond with two murder cases.
RIP to the best migo 💔💔
So sad. He was a good dude . R.I.P Takeoff 😞🙏
Over a dice game. So petty
It’s not big news who cares 🤷🏽‍♂️ 😂
My heart hurt. This has to stop! Y’all going off on Kanye and us as black people still have not resolve our issues in our community! Come on black men!😢 We are supposed to be leaders! Too many podcasters talking about unnecessary topics but still hasn’t rectify any issues that are still going on in the black community. RIP Take Off😢

Welcome to Texas.....
This is absolutely sad! This was definitely a hit and the reality is someone is always out to get these rappers. They still to always be some gang affiliation or some one jealousy. 😭. These streets are dangerous

Takeoff... SMH. Rest In Peace.
rip brother, man we really losing good artists left right and centre, ya truly hate to see it
well. You do stupid things you get results
They didn't mention if it was climate change or white supremacy that caused the shooting. Poor reporting, for sure!
😢
Damn ....just yesterday Coolio passed and not even a damn month another one is gone !!!!...
Imagine being a multi millionaire and getting killed over a dice game in some random pool hall at 2 in the morning on a tuesday... What a stupid way to die.
good
IN MY OPINION ALL OF THE MIGOS ARE TARGETS... THEY ARE THE FLASHIEST RAPPERS IN ALL RAP AND THEY LEGIT WAS SAYING WALK IT LIKE A TARGET IN THEIR SONG. PROMOTING THE WRONG STUFF ALL THIS TIME AND LOOK NOW YOU LOST THE BEST OUT OF THEM ALL....
you ll be missed
I don’t listen to them but this is still tragic
14/90. Nothing more to say. Black community leaders need to really do something already. Enough is enough. Cut the shit or you will forever be known as 14/90.
😪🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️❤️
Damn...
You have to be shitting me bro
Wowwwwww nobody is safe anymore 😢
takeoff 🥹💔
Rip
When take off heard shots he should have took off!
Holiday season gona be rough… I’m sad 😢
He should have did what his stupid rap nickname suggests.
Not surprising.
It’s crazy damn 😢😢I can’t believe it  Rip Takeoff 🕊 Condolences to the family and friends
Houston's NOT the place to be... as a rapper.  Check the stats.  Salute TakeOff.  R.I.P.
good riddance! "rapper" = a cult of violence and death. the culture they come from is all about violence death and lawlessness. they are disgusting and do not have any respect for life anyway.
Not man enough for that dinner date 😒            Huston keeps them under  Their feet.
Smh
Damn, that's the rap game toe tags
Omg omg
What !🙄
Wow Just Eff'n Sad!😢 This Will Probably Change Their Love For Houston.

Sacrificed
Too many cowards in the world, Why kill someone smh
Oh know I hope this a lie
A true hip hop legend😔💔
Wow omg rip another senseless killing damn
Fr not the migos brother
No idea who that is but RIP
Migos

Maybe if these young men would get real jobs and apply themselves other than being a wannabe rapper,  your lives would be something for the younger generation to follow and be inspired. Keep on Suckin' in life!
He took off lolz
What THE LITERAL FUCK..... ITS OFFICIAL RAPPERS ARE TARGETS
Being a rapper is a dangerous job
Damn.
I find it odd another rapper is "randomly" shot. No such thing as a coincidence.
Rest In Power bro
Rap be. Chillin because. Hood be. Killing.   Kanye says hi.
He should have took off
Offset vs lil baby?
Where was dudes security man
You cannot be a famous rapper these days and go anywhere without security or a squad. Especially somewhere like a bowling alley. You can't move like a regular dude once you reach his status. You have to ALWAYS be prepared for anything to happen and never get caught lacking. RIP TAKEOFF. U WAS A REAL ONE... I don't know what it's gone take for us to stop killing our own people...
Stop shooting each other!
Rip ? His ideas are destroying the black community. Talks about women being trash, and glorifies violence. Yea keep acting like he a saint. That’s what’s wrong with the black community. Glorify gangsters but if you try to educate yourself and speak correct english you a sale out. F that, you people are wack in the head !
Blk community making rich funerals caskets flowers and balloons business !!!
Not takeoff 🤦🏾‍♂️
Didn’t bother a soul 😢😢😢😢
Shit rapping ain't easy, why is it that everything that colored people are associated with their is violent, shooting, killing. And mayhem, and they are always looking for justice.
"They" say he was shot by one of his own people first smh
idiot who pulled the trigger you better have a good answer judgment when you face God…    Rest in peace my heart goes out to you and your family
Sad
Clapped in the dome.. damn..
Rapper Takeoff took off, that's a wrap! Next!

Shelf life for rappers is not to appealing very sad news and thoughts and prayers for his family
Dont worry a couple weeks will go by we will forget about it and the next rapper will get shot. Bunch of animals bro rinse and repeat.
Wtf no. Rip takeoff :(
Please tell me this is a prank… 😢🤦🏾‍♂️👎🏿
Rappers getting shot never heard of such a thing! This is what rap culture is all about right? He died embracing the culture he loves. How poetic.
Y'all supposed to be kings but nothing but a bunch of jesters shooting each other... Clown ass black folks here in the good ole USA embarrassing the rest of the black population across the globe.
Blum
Damn you'll be miss brother smfh

Too many shooting s rest in peace  over a dice it's a same now then ever  condolences  to his family
Fox 5 y’all need to shut up and not report anything about black culture . This network is probably celebrating
During these difficult times, let's not forget to take a moment to celebrate diversity!
This is the culture they live in.
Gotta stay outta the mix...😎🙏👻🎃
Maybe throwing around the N word isn't a good thing.

What led up to the shooting? Maybe being at a bowling alley at 2:30 in the morning playing dice 🤔
What in the world yo ……Just Heartbreaking too much of this is going😢
Tragic I thought people were trolling on ig
Oh boy
It 100 % happened with an illegal gun over illegal drugs . Let that sink in to you anti gun lefties .
the jewish puppet masters are rubbing their hands smiling right now this is what Kanye is trying to warn everyone about, the music that is being blasted all over platforms promotes killing over the slightest inconvenience.
My heart is breaking rn💔. I can only IMAGINE what the family is going through😭.
shit is ridiculous. smh my God rest ur sould
Never heard of him
damn
This just seems so surreal 💔💔😩. May he Rest In Peace 🙏🏽. JUST WOW. Prayers for the fam.
Trash generation think that killing someone for something as simple a dice game is fine. We keep yelling Black Lives Matter but when our live actually matter to us? A this rate racist can just sit back and let us wipe out ourselves. The rate our black men are getting killed or locked up we are going to have to marry another race.
Never heard of him
In a bowling alley playing dice.......yup thats all it takes these days...
Well this is shocking to hear.  No one is safe anymore being anywhere at anytime.  Condolences for the loss of another young man in the prime of his life.
Migos was the soundtrack to my life for quite a while. Oh, this is horrible.
Snake eyes
He didn't takeoff quick enough this time
My fav of the Migos...R.I.P.
This shit is crazy man! Wtf
Man. Y'all got to stop killing each other!!!
Oh no 😢so sad praying for his family
This was my favorite migo. He always stayed out of bullshit. RIP to one of the 21st centuries best rap trio’s members. 💙❤️💙❤️😂❤️
RIP in pieces
How safe is American cities ?
Usual suspects strike again.
So BLM, OK........
Rappers don't live long! The label has an insurance policy on him!! I promise!!
He was the most talented
Bruh……..
Like everyone is saying about him he hardly speak he just wanted to make music and get money and enjoy life never heard him in the news for dumb shit most of these rappers getting into rip
REST EASY ❤❤❤🙏🏽
Over a damn dice game my people are very stupid
2:30 out in Houston that was a no no
Another great mind taken
So was it a strike?
Quavo a dirty mf. Say it’s conspiratorial but I’m tired of seeing it happen in Hollywood and we act stupid!! Migos and other artist were leaving their label just like Pac and Biggie. Quavo knew what was up and is gonna stay with Quality Control because that’s how the industry work
He was the best spitta in the Group he had bars...RIP Takeoff 🙏🏿
No more peddling illiterate music for you young man. Good riddance.
Y'all truly only care cause he was one of y'all favorite rappers. Not that our community continues to do this to ourselves. We just in a rinse an repeat cycle. Praying God opens some eyes an heals the hearts that truly need it.
RIP
TMZ kill a lot of people
Soul sellea
May GOD reign Judgement! So Very sad!
R.I.P takeoff...one of the rap band of our generation we grew up listening and these guys always delivered their best.
No not again. RIP TAKEOFF. Condolences to the family 😥💔🕊🙏🏽
This is sickening....beyond heartbreaking...King killin Kings😭...Lord pls help our men🙏🙏🙏🙏
These violence is getting worse Always be a legend
May the homie rip...having said that, i laughed od when this dumb ass reporter who probably ain't listen to hip hop before, says this was a devastating blow to hip hop?!?! Their shit was never hip hop, it was rap cause that's what they were doing, just rapping, hip hop is something you live, just like the blastmaster said.  Let's just say hiphop went underground when Diddy and Fat lip Gay z decided to change the game for worse cause the real  hip hop was on the verge to take over.  Now we have these pussy ass lames thanks to them and the elites that fuck em in the ass for being good obedient scumbags!
Watching from Jamaica 🇯🇲
Why, rip takeoff sleep well
African-American Culture, move on.
Wow man stay prayed up. Its hard not to turn into a demon ...  its hard but try to not give in to the devil  . Good and evil is everyone we choose to be either or . I hate leaving the crib its open season on the world.  I walk in zig zag frfr. Rip 2 every person who gets taking by the ghetto.
This is just sad, this one hurts, RIP King 👑 hold it down!
Got all the money in the world and want to be hanging around aint shit people all hours of the night and to be killed over a dice game 🤦🏽‍♂️
Caught lacking probably ops don't sleep 🤫
NOOOOO WTFF
Jesus that's crazy. R.i.p buddy
Too young. Rest in peace, Takeoff.   When are we going to stop doing this to each other?
BLACK PEOPLE JUST WONT STOP KILLIN EACH OTHER
Can’t believe they referred to him as a fraction to announce his death
Wtf blood!!! I can't believe another rapper and my ninja r.i.p. This shit got to stop for real.
Holy shhhhhhiiiii wtf???
Satanists
WTF
What Hip Hop have come to now, a genre invented by black Puertoricans in 1971 South Bronx…
damn rip
He's gone? Oh dang, I wasn't a fan of the dude but that shocks me
The culture is the problem.
Respect,seen on some about take off showing him on floor/recording n im like take this down n so so disrespectful
We kill each other like it's nothing but dude that killed him will get caught real soon.
RIP
I am so 💔 I can’t believe it  a legend die so young , I hope they find and pay who did it Serve justice my condolences for his family
Don't act surprised. Even if this guy wasn't beefing with anyone, people in the rap industry have created an atmosphere of hostility and now there are just random acts of violence as a result.
🥺🥺🥺🥺
"I do this for the fam, cuz this shit bigger than me" RIP
What
We don't play in Texas...ooh wee. everyone in strapped up. It's dangerous to be here
There goes another "Pillar of the Community".  How will we cope?
Respect,heartfelt condolences n family,fans stay strong
Another reason for any celebrity to just stay home . It’s shame but you can’t be out there with all the jealousy n envy
Quavo shot him.
RIP TAKEOFF!
This is why it’s impossible to take BLM seriously
He was the best one in the group
He took off, and now dead. He died doing what he loved.
BLM 🤦🏾‍♂️
Too bad so sad
If I was rich like him. I wouldn't ever shoot dice unless it's in a casino. If u already got money u just playing for the fun of it. A broke nigga will kill u over 20 dollars especially if he lost his money on the dice.
Yikes!! This looks really bad for our city. How sad.
What the actual Fook? Thus is getting ridiculous
Rappers are becoming an endangered species
The glorification of “thug” culture claims another victim.
I CALL BS... and I am for it today.  This is nothing but another plot in the movie world that we live in today where another CHARACTER is killed off.    Now watch the other two get back together and blow up from this.  This movie really sucks.
My heart was very hurt and heavy this morning as I wanted to just stay in the bed. RIP Takeoff
The Migos are goofy.
He’s the most humblest one
Never heard of Takeoff.  Never heard of Offset.  Never heard of Quavo.  Never heard of Migos, but I'm guessing Migos is hood slang for 'amigos'.
Yo quavo i feel ya bruh 😣 makes no sense bro I’m shocked af just woke up to bullshit
The real holocaust
Rip a legend ❤😢
Whos3 body double was that? Report to your prayers so the aliens can continue their investigation on who needs to die  Ps they already know who needs to and who they’re going to kill
There's cameras everywhere they can figure out who did it
GOV ABBOT.  Your gun laws do it again.
I did it
Why do they have to say 1/3. Why not just a member of Migos
Supposedly Quavo shot him by accident shooting sideways like O Dawg smh
Damn this fuck me up today my condolences goes the family
Oh! No it's unfortunate. Takeoff is one of my favorite artist. I will always remember you. May your soul Rest In Peace😭😭😭
Wow to the dome? What a loser man, hope the shooters family pays for this. Hope they feel real pain and just burn in hell
i guess takeoff finally landed.
WTF slim had skills, RIP 🙏🏽brother
Damn they straight sacrificed him
1TAKE ! 🕊️
🙏🏾
This is so sad. REST easy bro.🙏🙏🙏🙏
Damn!!!! Rip bruh
Another "Battle of the Bands" with guns. Another "hit" song going to the top "with a bullet". Sad times in H-town!
A tremendous loss for humanity
[Quran Chapter 59]  18. O you who believe! Fear God, and let every soul consider what it has forwarded for the morrow, and fear God. God is Aware of what you do.  19. And do not be like those who forgot God, so He made them forget themselves. These are the sinners.  20. Not equal are the inhabitants of the Fire and the inhabitants of Paradise. It is the inhabitants of Paradise who are the winners.  21. Had We sent this Quran down on a mountain, you would have seen it trembling, crumbling in awe of God. These parables We cite for the people, so that they may reflect.   22. He is God. There is no god but He, the Knower of secrets and declarations. He is the Compassionate, the Merciful.  23. He is God; besides Whom there is no god; the Sovereign, the Holy, the Peace-Giver, the Faith-Giver, the Overseer, the Almighty, the Omnipotent, the Overwhelming. Glory be to God, beyond what they associate.  24. He is God; the Creator, the Maker, the Designer. His are the Most Beautiful Names. Whatever is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Him. He is the Majestic, the Wise.  www.quranwow.com
We only rise up when it’s a cop or a white man who pull the trigger!!
Sounds like a setup to me
Sad part is he was definitely the coolest one in the group, it’s a messed up way to go out but I hope the other two can put that pride to the side and come together
R.I.P. to Takeoff   This "news" dude just read the TMZ report basically word for word. live on air on a news broadcast. Do some research man
Awww hell nahhh 😭
RIP TAKEOFF 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🕊️🕊️🕊️ MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY 😭😭😭😭🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️
The black community needs to stop this Wild West behavior.

That's crazy.  This the reason I don't go nowhere.
LOL at every goofy fan acting like they knew the guy

Another one bites the dust
When you promote evil lyrics to your own community the same will be taken out from his own
People heard the shooting but didn't see who did the shooting. People know what went down but won't snitch.
Damn take 💔
Crazy man. Sending my condolences
If you are one of these gangster rappers NOBODY should be surprised when you get gunned down
Rest in Power brother.  You will be missed.
UNBELIEVABLE

Insurance policy for the record company another sacfrice.
Wow, condolences to that man family 😢🙏🏽

Omfgg broooo.. this shit is unreal asf💔 rest in power takeoff
Dude rarely speaks, cool rapper, No big scandals, a calm black man who just raps.He is human, lets give him his respect🥺🥺💔  EDIT: this post isnt about race. black or white. I'm trying to describe this man,thats all. No other intentions,dont get it twisted/wrong. i didn't know him personally, he was among my fav rappers, and this news hit me hard. my problem is with the people spreading those pictures of his dead body on the floor with quavo screaming for help. thats not cool, he has family too. Who sees a dead body on the floor and decides ''let me take a picture and post"..#RESPECT.
Texas is a 3rd world state. Most gun crimes in America
Black on black murder blm where you at??
My heart just dropped
Of course no one saw anything
Cancel rap.
Normal activity in the black community. The hate and envy is overwhelming. I consider myself lucky to have only lost time and not my life from a guy I called my brother and treated like family for 16 plus years. Let’s just say I handled my priorities well and he didn’t.
His own peoples killed him ashamed!!!!
He is not just a rapper. He is a man. Show respect
“We need to do better!” - nothing is going the change when you guys support this culture. Trap music = narco-terrorism lifestyle. Stop lying to yourselves 🤥. Nothing will change. Rest In Peace to someone who should be enjoying life ✝️
His side shot first. Other side shot back.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾lord
This don’t seat right with me, Takeoff ain’t never do shit to nobody. This the first time a rappers death hit me so hard. Rip Takeoff 🙏🏿🙏🏿

THAT SHIT HURT ME THATS MY DOG FOR REAL 😩😩😩😭😭😭😭😭😡😡😡😡😡
Migos will never b the same r.i.p takeoff

Another sacrafice, this  rap industry is really contrived!
Im really confused right now, because according to the Obamas, Lebron James, Kamala Harris, Joe Biden and the Democrat party, the biggest killers of Blacks in America is “White Supremacy” and Donald Trump supporters.
RIP TAKEOFF DAMM SMH 😑
