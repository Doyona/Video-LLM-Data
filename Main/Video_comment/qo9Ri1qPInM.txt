Hae soo said Right now 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Did anyone else rewind that part?
The fun part is that I have heard the (similar) Korean versions of «thank you» and «squid game» (or more specifically "games" or "the games") being said so many times that I now recognize it without problem. I don't need subtitles for it. 😂😂
There is something about Jung Ho-yeon that is so instantly attractive about her.  She's a model of course but she absolutely shined in her first acting role.
Who's here after season 3😔
Sang woo❤
Park haesoo is so funny
The boy will appear in season 3

Chulsoo and younghee

They’re all so good looking
the way they try they’re hardest to speak english my heart is melting 😭❤️
Jimmy goes, “I’m not going to spoil it. No spoiler alerts.” But then give some sneak spoilers.🙄
I a big fan of Squid games 1-2 can't wait for season 3. ❤ I love Gi-hun and the front man my favourite ship. ❤
rewatching because i binged season two
Jesus Christ loves you everyone
양한수
Huh, I Tght in reality,.

지금 right now!

"No spoilers" *Proceeds to play a scene frm squid game*
0:09 those just sounds like karate words
"Wi Han Jin"?
She only girl who speaks English
I watched this series recently absolutely amazing emotional and beat series I ever watched actors have done their maximum

He said wi han jin😂
Love from India 🇮🇳
I love watching squid game on Netflix ❤💜💖💚
Squid game s2 casting ie finished yet
1:28. I wonder what Jimmy Fallon was going to say Bigger Than ?
3:02, that doll is Bibisara Assaubayeva, the born in 2004 baby chess GM player chick from Kazakhstan!
numbers are not coincidentialy placed in the movie. now i m thinking more about it the main protagonist won 45.6 billion won. and his number in that royal battle brutal game was 456.
I'm 2 years late to this show. The cast are great and Sang Woo looks 10 yrs younger in real life 🤣🤣🤣
Why is the such a relief that this guys are happy
They are all so beautiful and charismatic. And their skin is wrinkle free
Jimmy Fallon is beyond obnoxious
"no spoilers" goes ahead and show actual clips
I so much love this movie
Excellent script, brilliant actors, beautiful photography, each character splendidly written. Love, hate, the Good and the Bad. Characters are complex. Never boring. A Master piece no doubt
"Around a sphere"
Perfect
❤❤nice
Not giving away any spoilers Jimmy? You basically told the plot of the first episode.
Baby squid ❤❤❤
Wow
https://youtu.be/qo9Ri1qPInM
Woww
Best
ممتع البرنامج
I love Park Hae Soo
I love Jung Ho-yeon so much
Where player 017?
This is not my first K-Drama that I watched, but I am glad that it is the first K-Drama to get this much attention even after all these years. I honestly can’t wait for whenever Season 2 comes out!
Love the Squid Game cast, their cool chill vibe is a treat to watch in interviews 👏👏👏👏😃
😭😭😭😊😊😊am just glad to see them alive cuz it seemed so real n I was starting to believe was real
Baby Squid, how cute
Is no one gonna talk about how good hoyeon speaks English
from our elemantary Bill and Jill. It's Jill
when new season?
Best webseries
Quite a surprise the World 🌏 love to watch Squid Game from South Korea! 🇰🇷  Maybe because of their Good Scripts , Actors & Directing since the K~Pop boom in the 2000s ... Grateful & Happy to have a taste of these South Korean well made movies & music in our entertainment choices!  🌷🌿🌏💜🕊🇰🇷
0:10 리청재, 팍해수, 위한진 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
jimmy why didnt u ask her anything, its not ok ...
Just watched this clip, and why does Jimmy barely acknowledge Hoyeon when she answers his question and then proceeds to continue interviewing the male cast and never her? (In addition, she was the only one who had mastery of English to respond directly without translation!) This is such a classic, textbook case of men ignoring women in the room. Do better Jimmy.
哇，有趣😂
For some reason the woman has no earphone.
This fr made me rewatch squid game again-
Here from my obsession for choi do il. Iykyk
When it comes to entertainment and movies United States are ranked number 1 but you have to get props to the Koreans who made great TV shows but squid game is such a great TV show.. I also get a lot of respect because the casting was incredible all of them gave a great performance.... And I can't wait till season 2 of squid game... That I have a theory about the squid game is that everything's thinks Oh II-nam the one behind it... Now I believe that yeah he was behind the squid  game in South Korea... I believe that there's a square game in different countries that are run by the most powerful people in the world... I think they do this because that's a world is overpopulated especially in different countries that it takes a strain under resources... So I think the VIP are part something really big... Also one of the VIPs as soon as they're walking in the room where they're going to watch one of them says the best squid game is in Korea...
Yesss!!!❤
왜 정호연한텐 아무것도 안 물어봐
okay next interview must be Park Eun Bin (Extraordinary Attorney Woo) make it happen! thanks
They're so polite I love it
헌트 보고 여기까지 옴ㅋㅋㅋ 이정재 넘 잘생김
Genial
pls lee jung-jae and park hae-soo are so fine and for what
no audience
Is jimmy know Korean??🙄
The fact that real life is a squid game itself and this interview is also sort of that
I only know two movies of ha joon 1:squid game 2:gonjiam the horror asyllam
Hoyeon is a little bit awkward, but the men are truly gentlemen, specially HaJoon.
Jimmy: I'm giving out no spoilers today! Also Jimmy 1 minute earlier: proceeds to let out a spoiler about the first game
Great show. Main actor was brilliant. Clap.
omg i become mother in law
Funny all of the series records have to put "English" on their titles all because of Squid Game's achievement🤭
They are just great 😌 Korean dramas are just awesome.
5 bulan yang lalu
JunHo is my favourite character
Really enjoyed Squid Game. I wish I could say the same for Jimmy… I really do…
...but what about the Doll also looking just like Peko Chan..?
I.   I've.   the.    Said.   Game
The show died faster than the characters
Korean culture has been the most popular in Asia since 20 years ago
Mind blowing show brilliant acting❤waiting for season 2,Love from india🇮🇳
Loved this interview Jimmy Fallon is a fun and joyable guy
when i heard squid game was viral its was October 3rd I was on youtube I seeing a lot of videos about squid game I was like what what is squid game so I ask my brother what is squid game he told me it was a show so I watch it and now I know squid game is popular
Amazing
Horrible interview setting
now i'm waiting for jimmy to interview the cast of "All of us are dead"
Most people do not know that Korean Artis cosmetic plastic surgery is the best way to look beautiful.  Everyone there has cosmetic plastic surgery to make their nose, face shape and eyes beautiful.
Sioentheqold
Jimmy did a really good job saying everyone’s name to the best of his ability… I would have just got very frustrated and wouldn’t have wanted to disrespect them
한국어 자막 감사합니다
Where's Ali though I don't see him in any of the interviews together and the fact that he actually did a pretty great job
The actor who plays the cop is handsome omg
Every year, Korea is making a break through. I wonder if "All of us are dead" will also be the same
*I like how respectful they are. Honestly, I did not expect that Hoyeon is fluent in English.*
*I love Ho-yeon's laugh all throughout the video. In the series, she looks cold but in real life she's sweet and simple.*
*DADDY HAE SOO IS REAL, HE BECAME A DAD THE DAY WHEN SQUID GAME PREMIERED*
Now I know the name of the psycho doll, her name is "Younghee".
Season 2!
Jimmy is so amazing his interviews his personality everything is so great he is so nice to everyone ✨💜💜keep going Jimmy we love u
Before squid game even existed, my friend’s sister would always tell me Korean Entertainment is phenomenal and underrated, now I believe her after watching squid game
Hey I can't wait till the season 2
They are so warm hearted. Protect them at all cost
HyJuin was a SECOND lead in romance I’d a bonus book and now I’m watching him on JIMMY FALLIN what is happening 😩❤️❤️❤️
I just finished watching the series and I just needed to see an interview seeing them healthy and happy <3
I love Netflix & Squid Game for broadening my horizons! I’ve been so into Korean films & tv since this aired. If anyone has any suggestions for other Kdrama, feel free to leave them:
Damm, the actors know they’re shit! I thought few of them died
Not me coming here to see that Wi Ha Joon is okay after that SCENE IN EPISODE 7
3:40
Love the cast. Jimmy is awkward AF lol
He’s not giving spoilers yet he gives away the 1st game glad I didn’t watch this before watching it.
Show was way better than I thought it might be. I was impressed. Some great acting.
Jimmy Fallon is very much nervous because the show reveals a lot of what CAN go on in the Elite’s circle. Sick fuck has probably done something similar. This show is a mocking of the western’s
In...our India....this movie getting great success ❤️ love from India
Me ❤️067 And 456 218
No spoilers, but people get shot because of the doll?
God, Fallon is fucking insufferable.
ugh hajun is so cute i fkn cant
Wowew
bro said “no spoilers” but showed a squid game scene 😂
Squid. Game
wo ist 001
Jung Ho-yeon was the only one who look right into the camera :D
Where Ali?
Park Hae-Soo is amazingly pretty. OMG I love him soooooo much 😭😭😭😭
Menca el 456 😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘😙😙😗😗😗😗😗😨
Fact:gihun is already 49 but he's still handsome aaaaaaaa loml
wowwwwwww
Fallon shines in this style of interview. Not so much when he’s cancelling Norm Macdonald, but still, good on him.
I don’t understand what they’re saying it in Korean but I only understand what you’re saying in English
It’s cool how they are trying to speak English
where's Ali
it's so weird to hear some of these guys speak English. This is cool though
I'm proud to say that wi ha joon is my favourite actor 💞
One of the greatest shows ever made. Fan from India.
I wish he would have spoken to "pick pocket" a bit more.
i hate the fact Ali is not here,he literally saved the main characters life.
A A A
I mean everyone here are whipped for ha jun and hoyeon
Also junho
456, 240, 199, 218, 101, 212, 111, 067, and 001
✨سكويد قيمز
Moral of the =           They are proud to say there mother tongue . But we Indians always talking in English in front of media
I love 067 girl
L love 067  girl
The show reminded me of the old movie "Cube" that I also loved. Its cool with Netflix that they do stuff from other countries, I'm sooo boooored of the same old movie recipes from Western studios. If it was up to me they would have gotten every single prize.
Squid game is The best game ever
Where is Ali?
0:14 위하준 배우 위한진으로 언제 개명하심?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ He said Hanjin instead of Hajoon... straight up gave him a new name lmao
Jimmy was stunned to speak
I just noticed that the cash prize in squid game is 45.6 million dollars and Gi-hun's number is 456
Squid game would've ended in first episode without Ali..
l love squad game from India 😘🇮🇳
They’re so good looking 😍
3:55 "Churso!" how cutely she said💕🤗
Wanted to see Anupam Tripathi a.k.a. Ali Abdul with them in these shows.
2:02 Jimmy has his heart in his right side
This cast is so damn attractive.
Love the Jimmy Fallon show
You'd think this nuthole would take the time to briefly go through the list of his films on wikepedia or least read all the plots rather quickly before this interview. Oh well. Why do they get paid so much is odd. What is rather onset and profound in this film... (spoiler) is its comment on criminals and prisoner mentally, OH, here, if we kill others, how easy that is and more money in the bank with each one dead. So many on the onset goes in that way. From there it trickles to each personal drama, and the twist of the coupling where it turns on the other on a 50 50 game, and etc. of Alliances. And then the mix in with the CIC with the missing brother, and the shards thereby went against the winners it its arbitrary death, and also returning some. It was a bit ... like watching Tyra Banks show kinda in those kinda of enders.  But it was way fun. SNL just bitter all they're known for is frat boy sick joke light movies. Bit BLOCKBUSTER in the u.s. but ....
It's bigger then -  *WHAT*
1:34.... I swear he is sooo f*cking adorable.... I can't I can't I can't
1:37 just for edits yes
Lee Jung Jae also starred in Korean movie "Il Mare" in 2000. Then it became an inspiration for 2006 American movie, "The Lake House" starring Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves.
이야 이정재 수트핏 장난 아니네
Does jimmy know korean?
Squid game is super serial
LOVE THEM!❤️🇰🇷
They soo friendly
Da fuk bro I didn't know Jimmy Fallon understands Korean
Young Lee jung jae https://youtube.com/shorts/mRLEjXfMiaM?feature=share  https://youtu.be/VEOzr6jFQO4
It’s about time kdramas get the recognition they deserve from locals👀
Lee Jung Jae did so many roles in so many movies and tv dramas and not only bad roles but good and innocent ones as well. You need to do more studies before the interview!
I loved Squid Game. It is fantastic. And Park Hae Soo is so handsome x
Haha cool
4:52 wtf was that? F squid laugh
WHERE'S ALI???!!!!
Lee Jung Jae and Park Hae soo also speak English Too. But they too shy to speak. But Hoyeon Jung Does.
The cop is sooo fine
jimmy your laugh is so damn fake
And Ali
I can’t sang soo betrayed his team he killed Sae bieok
Glory to North Korea !
How is she so good at english?
I though seong speaked english?
국뽕이 차오른다
I love Sae Byeoks accent ( I don't know her irl name)
I LOVE HOYEONS ENGLISH😩
Best
can i just say i screamed on top of my lungs when the agent said his name was « Hwang Jun-ho » in the show because recently i became a hottest as in a hard-core fan of 2pm after watching Vincenzo and the youngest member of 2pm’s last name name is Hwang and the second youngest member’s first name is Jun-ho and i love those two and adore their friendship.
Jimmy always knew how to deliver. A real pro host.
overhyped series...the plot is for kids
우왕 한글 자막있당.. 완전 좋아
*Lee Jung-Jae has became single.*  Holy sh*t buy me tickets for south korea-
It was 90 days ago
How was this 5 days ago
i am so sad :<
Now that Park Hae Soo is getting more popular, do yourself a favor and watch his series, PRISON PLAYBOOK!!! I swear this series is a gem!!
Mostly known for villains where ?😭
him pronouncing the names are not it its jung not chung omggg
Jimmy you can understand korean
Its like my story in Iran, red light green light and solving bullets to rain
He says "no spoilers" but mentions the story of the doll and what role the doll plays in the show.
🥰
This show is awesome! It has a bit of similarity though with Japan's "As the God's Will"
OMG
It's actually a copy of lost.
Say what you want about Jimmy , but he is perfect for breaking the ice between cultural boundaries and making things presentable to the audience.
Jimmy Fallon has no idea what they are saying in Korean
박해수 짱~~~♥♥
This is the first time kdrama literally broke all the records of popularity, not only in kdrama world, but everywhere. Proud of em :D
Everyone's like, "Oh wow, Korean dramas are good!" I'm here thinking, "Have these people been living with their heads in the sand?"
Hermoso vídeo
I'm not giving any spoilers tonight... right after he reveals the first shocking fact about the creepy doll.  Good to see the crew anyway.
the end clip was amazing! ali is probably the nicest character in the show.
11m
ali the legend saved- i forgot the name of Gi-huns actor-
Omg these peoples are real
This is YouTube
They should have called anupam tripathi too
new aot game 🙏🏼🌟 https://youtu.be/F1mYekxO7n4
No ones gonna say how perfect the actor of sae byeok’s English accent is?????
Just how bad are the subtitle translations? And could the dub possibly be a better option? Great show with a horrible ending, or an over-rated show with an appropriate ending? Find out as The Crack Cellar reviews - Squid Game (Season 1) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f08rIEjSGas&t=4612s
Excellent high performance 4k quality gaming https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=leQChulaJmM
hes not asking anything to the lady
I literally cried at the end of episode 5
Looking forward to the second season
A memorable dalgona with a touching old sitcom. https://youtu.be/71NpERwOG7k  The real reason why Korean traditional kimchi is delicious. https://youtu.be/dsxVc9UTtAc
Right now...perfect answer!
fallon is such an egocentric garbage host.
Jung Ho-yeon ENGLISH IS SO GOOD OMG
I really appreciate the respect that Jimmy showed, that he did some research beforehand. I've seen interviewers ask Lee Jung-Jae how he's adjusting to his newfound fame, not bothering to learn that he's been a star in Korea for decades. It really reflects well on Jimmy and the show that he knows their names, and background on them, even though these are basic things.
Thank god it was just acting
What about this improvisation? 😮🔥 https://youtu.be/p0xkCS7nwvI
Amazing actors
Amazing actors
Why I am very happy to see that they are happy in real life...?😄 Their characters in squid game make me cry a lot may be that's y...💞❤️
Im just a salty EVA fan
watching jimmy fallon is a struggle. probably least entertaining person on the planet
Can't get enough of these beautiful korean actors. But they're so happy living their lives. No matter how scary or how harsh or intense this serie is, id rather stick with them til the end.
Was I the only one that was hella suprised when the started speaking english?!
Love the interviewees, but Jimmy is the ultimate cringe. Ugh. His energy doesn't match the interview at all, fake laughing too hard, and cheering before they or the clip finishes.
Jimmy Fallon: "I'm not giving any spoilers tonight, so everyone knows"   Also Jimmy 2 mins later: *Shows clip of Ali saving Gi hun*
You could have invite Ali too
It is so good they talk in their mother toung n don't bother to kw or talk in English
Why is HoYeon’s english like so GORGEOUS and ADORABLE. 😍
If you believe in your heart that Jesus died on the cross for us and confess with your mouth that Jesus is lord you will be saved!
This guys looks and sounds same like in movie that’s Sus 😂
Jimmy is a insincere twerp
I am proud to be a korean
Jimmy's forced laugh at 4:50 😑
The show is very dark but somehow is beautiful. No matter where we live, income inequality, greed, cruelty, and love do exist everywhere on earth.
The way Jimmy forces himself to laugh is not even healthy
All acted  very natural and interesting
SQUID GAME AS SO BAD
I hope the direction the sequel goes to will live up to this hype considering most of the key casts have died. Hoping for the best!!
All these people keep saying they don't want this person to be bad, or that person to be bad. Change that and the movie wouldn't be the same. The fact is, all these characters are different, which makes them unique. Each character gives us a different perspective and a whole new dimension of how to play the game, and why they play the way they play.
Fallon is always too much...
I love this cast.🥰
AHHHHH
“No spoilers” except for the spoilers
where is ali ?
The red light-green light doll should shoot Fallon for fake laughing for his guests.
2012 : Gangnam Style, hit the world.  2021 : Squid Game, kick the world.
*me being really happy about Jimmy pronouncing the cast’s name’s correct*
Where's Anupam
Kkkdkissflk'k'knfxjfidn'djek
I dislike jimmy fallon but cool that he had them on his show
I need Squid game season 2 in my life. It was so good i finished it in 2 days.
Wow
That Jimmy fake laugh after Jung-jae's straw joke, cringey asf 😂
They are all so good looking!! Woah!
Season2!Season2!!
Doll boy doll and giri doll
2th now
Would’ve been so funny if someone slipped a business card across the desk to Jimmy.
Gotta love jimmy really does his research ✨😌❤️
4:51 that was the fakest laugh I’ve ever seen
This is the first time something that became extremely popular wasn’t shit
I looovvee 067’s english
Sae byeok very fluent in English
los amoo
them speaking threw me off for a second as i forgot it was dubbed over so they don’t actually sound like the voice artists pahaha
Every successful country has their own language and they proudly speak in front of everyone except India. That's why India is very behind
But they didn’t show the face of ali😐
Stranger, Doctor Prisoner, Signal..there are so many excellent kdramas available on Netflix
The show: 💀🕷🔥 The actors:💖💅🥺
Marvel. I hope you take notes. This is a masterpiece.
Hoyeonnn!!!!! I love youu ahhhhhhhh
I got ZERO sleep binging this one...awesome series!
Wi Han yoon♥️♥️♥️♥️
Jimmy: Hae-soo, when did you realize the show become so big?  Hae-soo : Right now Me: wow he's so smart and intelligence😎
Not watching Netflix again till they put another Squid game exactly same idea Plzzz
These people made the show so so good, I am literally obsessed with everyone's acting and the plot of this show.
Sad byeoks real name is dawn
Wow Squid Game is awesome
Where's ALI!!?!?!?!
Isn't it bit racist to not call Ali( Anupam Tiwari) to the show. His role was no less.
I was sad Ali wasn’t there! I really wanted to see him answer some questions and see a bit of his real self.
why is the actor who plays ali not there with them or even the old man?
I really hate falon
Wow did not realise she could speak English!
Umarım bir sinama filmide olur aynı tam ekip 🙏🙏👍
the way HoYeon says GURLLL is cute
Reports: Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY...and he owns Danny's pizza gate and they make mcdonalds hamburger from the baby flesh
how much you wanna bet Jimmy never watched this show
spoilers..........😭
🙏
2 years ago Parasite and today Squid Games...I think cinema in Korea is improving a lot
the most sadistic and sick TV show and people worships this shit. This is normalizing violence and carnage
Great cast, great script, incredibly brutal, but the criticism of capitalism is also very clear.
I have a crush on every single person in this cast I swear
Ali should of have been as part of the guest as well
Koreans are beautiful people.
I don't know why as an american I get so much joy and pride seeing all of South Koreas recent successes and them really taking center stage in world culture. I admit I have a deep love for BTS but it's so much more than that. BTS was my intro into the intrest in Korea  but honestly it's so much more than that. I realize they have their problems (quit similar problems to my own country I might add) but to say that they aren't headed in the right direction would just be plain ignorant. America should take note to what it looks like when a country starts to invest in their people as well as holding their political figures accountable. Also they've had such a dark and sad history but they really show what hard work, community and perseverance of a group of people can do.
Just finished it. Amazing Show!
jesus, fallon makes every interview unwatchable.  a shame, i wanted to watch this past 2 minutes.
3:42
Jimmy: yeeeeesssss yesssss!!!😂😂😂 same
6:08 is that actually player thats supposed to have shit himself?
Does the audience even understand them? Like do they have a translator? Because it’s so cringe when they’re saying something funny and only Jimmy and them are laughing😂
5:01 He already gave spoilers about the first game :|
How sweet they were they didn't show off their fame just were proud of their team work ✨✨✨
Amazing actors, but Jimmy is so distractingly fake, makes me cringe
I'm missing Ali
If only that thug is here haha
sorry to ruin the good vibe in comments, but dang jimmy kimmel is so fu**ing fake. stop laughing! amazing job, squid game cast
Lee Jung -Jae is just magnificent in this role, acting masterclass.
Man by no means Lee Jung‑jae looks like he is 48....Holy shit....Koreans have great genes ❤️
Jimmy Fallon talks like one of the VIPs
I dont like it because anupam tripathi is not there
와 메인을 울배우들이 장식하고있네ㅋㅋ 대단하다 저번엔 비티에스였는데
He worst interview ever.
This cast is charming af
The performance of the cast is excellent, pls brainstorm more original scripts and make the plots more reasonable, instead of using a similar frame and story from Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji, Battle Royale, The Hunger Games? thank you, looking forward to season 2.
Some dumb people in the comment section be saying that squid game isn't a kdrama- LMAO. if it isn't then why are the actors/actresses from Korea? Why is this produced by koreans? and in SOUTH KOREA?? Kdrama stands for KOREAN DRAMA people. Some people just can't take this fact right. Anyways, squid game was great <3 one of the best kdramas this year for sure :)
Hi
You should invite Ali character too
4:51 well that was an awkward moment to laugh...
Omg Jimmy Fallon is trying so desperately...  It's embarrassing to watch.
korean representatives !!! 🥺🥺🥺👏👏👏👏
Hae-Soo:thank you! Wi Ha-Joon:thank you Hoyeon Jung:thank you for having us!
오징어 게임
she is SO gorgeous, miss girl is serving in that chair lmfao
I don’t get the hype this is literally one of the worst series I watched
the doll doesnt sing "Green Light, Red Light".. She is singing about blooming flowers..
4:53 is why i cant stand jimmy
Jung Ho-Yeon speaks great English!
👏🏻😍
Squid game is an illuminati and demonic production of the elites. Beware. Wonder why the show got popular so fast? Believe in Jesus Christ our Lord, He's the Saviour
Great 👍 😎
Best FREAKEN series EVER. They better come out with a part 2 but hopefully it don't take 10 yrs like the first one!!
👎👎👎👎👎
😂
Thought Kang Sae-byeok was cute on the show, but Jung Ho-yeon is ABSOLUTELY beautiful!!!!
Park Hae-soo is literally the sweetest and hottest guy ever and he still managed to make me hate his character to the bone and if that's not an Emmy award winning performance then that award is a fcking joke
If you liked Squid Game and you haven’t watch Anime you’re missing out on things as good as Squid Game
SQ Fever❤ Rooting for Part 2❤
The director was fabulous
I loved the squid 🦑 game movie! So awesome
" right now " iconic
Wowwwwww I wanna be in squid game nowwwwww jk no never but I love the cast
ok but how do they all look so fine 😩
We need Ali Abdul Right here.
I just notice Lee Jung-Jae is siting as a girl position 🤠😳😳
Why don't Korean actors learn English? If they can speak English, they will be able to communicate with more people.
why they didn't cast ali on show
just love the laugh of that cute player 067!! all of them are just phenomenal!!!
오징어게임이 넷플릭스에 처음 개봉 되었을때는 반신반의 했는데 전세계적으로 이렇게나  흥행와 작품성에서 두루 인기를 끌지 누가 감히 상상했겠는가.........결국 이런 날도 오는구나!
they’re all so attractive omgg
What a sh!tty show. So boring.
Binged watched all episodes of The Squid Game. Extremely well done and even though it is subtitled it is very addicting.   Can you believe this idea was started way back in 2008 ? Now showing in 80 countries.  Let nomination for awards roll in.  🏆
Beautiful cast! 🌼❤️
Anupam tripaathi!?
The asking the questions is always like aaaa ok ssssso wwwwe uuuuumm
All these east asian countrys will dominate literally everything.
Every day I enjoy more than everwatching Netflix, and the Squid game is one of those series, which you would want to see the whole day. So don't wait anymore because, the serie is waiting for you to be seen.
I feel like the reason people like squid game is because it takes a spin on the death game concept. Normally you’re forced to play but here people choose to play
Fallon is such a dreadful host. Why is he still on TV?
They crushed it. Each performance.
They're so sweet and amazing people, 😃✨
Biggest Show, Biggest Boyband... South Korea is on fire!🔥
Why is it such a relief that these guys are happy in real life
Hae-soo.. Sooo charming. Is it only me.. His viice is soo deep..
"Speaking native language", really? Didn't even bother to mention the name of the language they're speaking?
Is Jimmy Fallon drunk or something? I can’t with his fake laugh. Just here for the cast but he makes me cringe whenever I watch his show.
https://youtu.be/hDXu6uOaDlc
they absolutely fucking killed it, 10/10 show
Im not ngerti bapak2
🌝
Squid 🦑💥
6:36 Jimmy would have been a credible VIP.
Flex that I saw this way before it got popular , kdramas are amazing & so beautiful. Definitely better than english shows
jacinda ardern is NZ's Young Hee.
really good show!!!!!!!!!!!!! well deserved success i loved squid game
#FunnyTikTok Moment 🤣🤣🤣                      #Smart View                            #smart View

They were all very good in their roles… very good, congratulations!!
Phenomenal acting is what I believe makes this series so amazing! Happy I got into it.
I wish I see more artists on the show like Demi Lovato,Nicki Minaj and more
Love Korean stuff
This interview is disappointing lmao.
Can’t wait to see you again!
The politeness and humility  of the Korean actors is something I would like to see more in  American society.
I actually dont like squid game like others i like the roles in the series
Where is the ganster guy and old man? LUL
Netflix should give them a bonus or something, instead of sticking to the original contract amount.
Jimmy fake laughs in interviews a lot but this is a really good example of how he is with guests that he's actually interested in and has some chemistry with. Their whole dynamic is so much more fun than a lot of his other clips.
All of the actors were OUTSTANDING!!!
PlayStation getting free promotion
Does anybody else realize that the number of likes are 456
The people that are in the squid game show are so talented like how did they even do that act so talented. I love it!
Absolutely brilliant show kept me going
Are they alive after all?
*me realizing that gi-hun is player 456 and u win 45.6M dollars*
Jung Ho-Yeon sounds so fluent in english now, the improvement!
hoyeon jung has a very similar body type to me and it's just super reassuring to know so many people find her beautiful. her body type + confidence makes me feel comfy in mine 💗
After watching Squid game ,I became fan of Park hae soo ...He is sooooooooooo good!❤
Sometimes I’m into the show too much I forget that these people r actually actors lol
His excitement brings me back every time. 🙃🙃
Fun Fact: The main character's (Jung-Jae | Also known as Seong-Gi hun in Squid Game) number was 456 and the likes on this vid is 456k (0_0).
The longest I’ve tolerated fallon ever. Only because of squid game. But was cringing so hard on his laughter and mumbling. Why exactly is he famous? Some people are just born lucky.
There was the most notorious man in it and he's an absolute genius of an actor.
HoYeon’s English is so good! I’m so proud of her 💙❤️
the fact that gi hun would be dead if ali didnt save him in the red light green light game, but ali died himself...!
Ali the best
Come on fallon atleast let her speak . Give her time to complete her sentence don't cut her off in middle.
Khi có một cô gái mà cả đống trai nhìn thì....
They should invite Ali (Anupam). I never seen him any promotion videos. He really did a great role in squid game.
This is the best series I have seen in a long time....BRAVO👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿❤️
After Parasite and Squid Game I started to love Korean creativity
So excited for them. They did an awesome job!
They seem so chill! Love their vibe.
Why does Jimmy have to scream so much, christ. Also, "I'm not giving any spoilers!" ...proceeds to spoil the plot of the first game.
The times have really changed. Now Koreans make the world-wide popular media and produce the movie stars while the Americans have the weird over the top talk shows with the strange over-reacting host.
one of the worst dramas
The director barely got paid
Kids sad he didn't ask Sae-byeok more questions 😕
Ali's grab is truly iconic. It was that instance he became my favourite character
damn hoyeon can speak fluent english sheesh #hoyeonsupremacy
One of the best show!!!
You can hear the cringeworthy fake laugh of Jimmy at 04:51
Would've loved to see Anupam Tripathi. I guess he isn't a big star.
Korean subtitles???
HUGE Squid Game fan... HUGE!  Bravo, guys!!!  Lookin' forward to round 2 in 2022!
“Squid Game” Filipino Actor Christian Lagahit's worst experience in Korea:  "The most memorable one was when I was inside the village bus. It was the last trip, and I was sitting at the back because it was very small. It can only accommodate a few people to sit, so other people were already standing in the bus. There was this woman who was just staring at me. At first I wasn’t paying attention because I thought she was maybe looking at the boys, because there were boys in front of me. I thought that maybe she was just looking at the students. A few minutes passed by, and I was surprised when something hit my face. She threw a cabbage at my face—straight at my face. I was wearing eyeglasses at that time, and the first thing that I looked for was my eyeglasses because I couldn’t see. So I looked for my eyeglasses, and when I picked my eyeglasses up, they were already broken. I kind of used the broken eyeglasses to see because I’m farsighted. Then I asked, ‘I’m sorry, what’s happening here? Why did you throw this vegetable at me?‘ The hardest part was that no one was paying attention to me. There were a lot of people inside the bus. It was filled, but no one was there to at least help me. According to the other lady, ‘She wants you to step out of the bus.’ Because I’m not Korean, and that bus was intended for Koreans—but there’s no such thing as a foreigner bus here in Korea. She said, ‘You just have to go out.‘ And I was crying inside. For me, there was nothing I could do anymore. I couldn’t complain, but what I didn’t understand was there were other people inside that small bus. I just felt so bad that no one was ready to help [me.] Even when she was about to leave the bus, she was still screaming, ‘All foreigners here in Korea are bad people!‘ I remember those lines from her."  — Christian Lagahit  #squidgame  source: https://www.koreaboo.com/stories/squid-game-filipino-actor-christian-lagahit-recalls-time-korean-lady-threw-cabbage/
jimmy shud talk slowly becoz they might not fully understand, enlish is not their first language.
Omg saebyeok's english voiceee And The one is a boy And the one is grrr
Okay
I felt that Jimmy is so so excited!
My man in the red 🤤
Is this as big as Psy's Gangnam style?
Lee jeong Jae original heartthrob.
All Characters in Squid Game is Exllent 👌👌
These men are damn fiiinnnee
I’m super disappointed he didn’t engage HoYeon Jung at all.
What a great TV show Squid Game is I watched the whole 9 episodes in two days with English dubbing on :)
Where is Anupam Tripathi??? Ali????😢😢😢
Squid Game or Quit Game : Why Seong Gi Hoon deserves a better life (성기훈이 더 나은 삶을 살아야 하는 이유) ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHldXhDz0T0&t=89s
Fallon is uhhh really something
Squid Games is a MUST WATCH SERIES IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT!!!!
Jimmy must have taken hours to study there names, saying it so fluently
They all played an amazing act at theirs role
쇼는 훌륭했다 👍
They are just so charming in this interview- I loved this show!
Squid game part 2 https://youtu.be/nxhvBqZAnC0
You know you made it when you're on The Tonight Show! Congratulation to Korean TV! Fan from China.
Seeing the cast outside of the show, they're all so damn gorgeous 😍  Especially the guy who played Gi-hun, Lee Jung-jae; he looks WAAAY younger than I thought he'd be!
Omg finally I don't have to press subtitles thanks to them, Lol
Where is anupam tripathi😠
10M views! Incredible!!
mannn these actors so humble n wholesome i love it , couldn't stop smiling the whole time
how was the question about improvising not staged? xD so obvious
How come he didn’t ask the girl any questions and mostly just focused on one guy?
Wi Ha jun 😩🤌🏻
where is ali brother? he was betrayed again?
All very talented people! Glad we got to be introduced to them
Hope they got Sharon Choi (translated for Parasite and Han Yeri of Minari)
Why did Jimmy ignore Jung Hoyeon? No question for her ... she was amazing.
Finally an interview where Jimmy isn't interrupting or obnoxiously laughing while somebody else is talking... too bad it took a language barrier. Oh well.
Ali was not there
Asians are ruling in every aspects!!
Nice Jimmy in this show   really actors korean fantastic perfomance the game Is Dangerous and much suspence congratulation all the cast actors 💐
Who's here because of Anupam Tripathi...(Ali)
It's refreshing to see unknown actors in the movie. Hollywood stars are so familiar I couldn't see them as actors anymore. Scarlett Johansson - hello, Scarlet, I like you but don't care about your stage names, you're Scarlett for me. Dwayne Johnson - don't remember any single stage name of his roles. He's always Rock. Keanu Reeves - forever is Neo whatever movie his in. Unknown actors help to immerse into movie universe and forget about reality.
https://youtu.be/pG17ypWnqzo
I feel like the Network is keeping Jimmy hostage compared to other talk show host this is so awkward 😬
i just know the chulsoo things. so chulsoo is the boy character of that game? (and on the squid game they just use girl character)
I am pretty sure half of the people came to see the spoiler they showed in the last..... 😉 😊
Spoiler alert!  Do not share this clip with anyone who has not seen the show because Jimmy talks about the doll shooting people. Also don't show anyone the trailer. That needs to be a shocking surprise to anyone who is curious about the word "eliminated" when the rules of the first game are explained. Anyone can argue with me that viewers need to know that murder is involved before they watch.
Jimmy really needs to work on his fake laugh cus what the hell💀😭
Jung HoYeon is really pretty. Makes sense that she’s a model.
Saludos desde peru 🇵🇪🇵🇪
damn jimmy is drunk af here and his eyes scream "why am i still doing this holy shit"
Can’t wait for all the white people gate keeping Korean culture in these comments
Jimmy Falon has got to be the most annoying talk show host ever
I am patiently waiting for season 2, so excited!!!
I’m watching the series like I was in it
i love that even the united states are reading subtitles now, i mean, its good to know there is good content in languages other than english
It's number 1 because it's a good story with good acting. Americans and British would be number 1, but all they care about is diversity and pushing politics. Go back to focusing on the story like you did before the 2010s.
Hoyeon Jung English is amazing
자막이 있어... 상냥해
Why is jimmy fallon so cringe lately ?
Only played red light green light, marble, tug of war but it's first time I heard about squid game honeycomb and that glass bridge
Squid game ❤️🔥🔥❤️
they dont know eng
I’m still not buying Samsung
The guy from train to Busan😂😂
Jimmy is stuttering allot like absolutely i would’ve stuttered allot if I was in his place talking to the three kings and one queen
How are they doing this? This can't be live. Is Jimmy reading the subtitles or an interpreter is talking in his ear?
"back in 5 seconds!"
They speaks in english...they respects their language .. I love them
Hmm, when Jung Jae is describing the game he says for a cash prize of $45.6 billion. His # was 456, never picked that up. I guess it was a foreshadowing that he was gonna win.
please check out park hae soo's prison plybook. SOOOO GOOD.
This Horror Show Shows Who We Are A student of mine told me about a new show called “Squid Game.” It is a South Korean “thriller series,” as they call it, which has become a pop culture phenomenon and is the no. 1 show in more than 90 countries. The show presents several hundred people who are all in great financial debt and in dire emotional states. The producers pit them against each other, even if they are very close, and make them hate each other. The winner takes millions of dollars, and the others are killed. This show wouldn’t be so horrifying if it didn’t portray our true nature. The very fact that we watch such a show enthusiastically is proof that underneath the “civilized” façade, our nature is as the show depicts. It works like a magnet. We love to watch the struggle between good and evil, as long as we are safe from the consequences of the battle. The thing is that in this show, there is no good; there is only evil.  Indeed, humans are the worst being in reality. What makes us so uniquely evil is the fact that we explicitly want to harm others. We do not want to eat others because we will starve unless we do so; we want to see them suffer! We derive pleasure from others’ pain, and derive the most pleasure when we are the ones inflicting it. We often say that reality is like a jungle, where the strong eat the weak. However, in the jungle, the strong do not want to destroy the weak; they want to eat. Once they are full, they want to sleep and play, and not kill or hurt for fun. In the human jungle, we do not want to eat other people; we want to see them hurting! This is why the natural jungle thrives without any laws while the human jungle, which we mistakenly refer to as “civilization,” is disintegrating despite the laws that strive to limit our barbarity. If we had any hopes of finding goodness in human nature, “Squid Game,” and mainly its popularity, proves that we have nothing to hope for when it comes to human nature. If we can create such shows, and if they can be so popular, then we can do such horrors in real life. The only possible good that can come out of such a show is the realization that it is not fantasy, but an authentic depiction of who we are. Maybe if we realize this, we will be willing to do something about changing ourselves. The current trend is to dull our awareness of the human horror show we live in by making cannabis available and legal. Indeed, the more we learn about human nature, the more we realize that perhaps it is better to numb ourselves through life until it’s over. For now, we’re cheering at the sight of other people suffering, much like people used to cheer at the sight of poor men fighting against lions in ancient Rome. Only if we realize that it is not okay to be like that, our minds might open to other options. If such a diabolical program can be the no. 1 show in more than 90 countries, it means that the entire world is immersed in unhinged viciousness. There is a solution, but it is demanding and must encompass the entire world if it is to succeed. To change who we are, we must initiate a worldwide educational process where such programs are forbidden and pro-human-connection programs are produced and aired. Even if they are not popular, at first, we cannot allow ourselves to be exposed to the violent poison and culture of narcissism that we consume today. They may be sweet, but they are lethal. If people don’t want to watch shows about human connection, they can put aside their media devices and simply talk to one another. This will already be a major improvement to the current situation. It may not sound like fun, but what is the option? To live out the “Squid Game.” Besides, after some practice, we will discover that connection and care are far more rewarding and pleasant than destruction and cruelty, and do not carry the negative side effect that is our current culture.
When you watch lot of kdramas and Korean movies. Squid game looks normal. When you are new it's looks exceptional
I don't watch the Tonight show, I'm on here for the Squid Game cast, but I can't help but imagine how this interview would play out with someone like Conan O'Brien as the host. No slight on Jimmy, he seems lovely; but also aware of online discussions about his hosting/interview style.
I'm so glad that Netflix is making/showing films and programmes in other languages. English-speaking centrism is so limiting. Even dubbed, having content from other countries should hopefully demonstrate to people all over the world that human behaviour is essentially the same everywhere. Hopefully this will lead to less us/them dynamics.
I hope one thing people get from this show is the tragic reality that so many North Korean defectors face. HoYeon Jung knocked that role out of the park.
But where the hell was Ali!
They all talk in Korea is it that they don't know English or they don't want to talk to in English..
He said no spoilers but def ruined the whole premise of red light green light, jimmy needs to stop drinking
I REALLY MISS JOHNNY CARSON !!!!!!!!!!
Squid Game is pretty interesting show and the acting is top-notch. Very colorful characters and back stories. Lots of Easter Eggs throughout, which is always fun.   I worried how Jimmy Fallon's interview would go being virtual and translating back and forth. I assume it wasn't live and edited to look live, but it always amazes me how technology can help very different people to communicate effectively back and forth.
Hi Jimmy, you should invite Abdul as well! Poor immigrant. (The actor always plays roles as a immigrant in Korea.. same goes for this as well).
Where is Ali??
Squid game is Trash 🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
There should be another season of Squid Game. The players will be the corrupt politicians,  rich gamblers, executives who embezzles, drug lords, gambling lords, smuggling lords, crime lords, mafias,  illegal miners, etc. Those who gets rich because of illegal activities. Oh you ehem Lord, you know who you are so come on and join! lol   The salesman then will bet for more illegal activities ownership for the players. lol The games should be those illegal activities but in giant size form. lol Killing part for the players will be how they also kill their victims due to those illegal activities.   Now that will be like Netflix Lifetime Blockbuster series and continuous season up to 100 years. lol  Coz even if any of those ehem lords were captured, there will be new ehem lords to take the position. Then the title will be Squid Game Lord! LOL
They are all so attractive 😍
Is just me or, Jimmy is boring and his laugh is fake? I can understand that it isn’t that easy to talk with people so culturally different and even physically distant from you, but come on! As a host you should entertain, and be able to, in the first place, involve them and put them at ease if they appear shy or just feel themselves like out of place. This is a huge thing for them and dealing with all this sudden and global attention can be overwhelming and difficult to handle. Jimmy hasn’t been empathetic, but only fake and concentrated on the show and about saying the right thing. He looks neither that charismatic.
Kdramas need to be recognised by whole world!!glad to see that….cause they deserved!!😊😊
Love this❤squid game❤❤
I love squid game so much
يازينهم 😩💗💗
i particularly enjoyed episode 6 & 7…. Heart wrenching and keep my butt at the edge of the couch watching every step they crossed the glass bridge!!! What a test of human nature… the struggle of human darkest sides in order to stay in the game and to outlive other players 🙈🙊
where is ali??
Jimmy is unworthy.
no spoilers.... but literally just spoilt about the shooting Doll LOL
Squid Game was too good.. Watched all the 9 episodes in one day..couldn't get up.. Congratulations to all the cast and crew...
Gi-Han the actor looks like a villian
Watching jimmy struggle with not only dealing with video chat, but also not offending cultures, names, and read subtitles all at the same time is fucking hilarious
The female character has the saddest back story, She is so serious in the show but very outgoing in reality, she must be extremely talented actress to change her personality that easily
i wish ali was here
why does Jimmy laugh so fake
why didnt he ask the girl any questions
God Jimmy Fallon is the absolute worst
The characters act like real human beings, not like cartoons.
3:45 her English 🥺
The boy and the gurrr.
How is jimmy laughing at the jokes if he doesn’t know korean?
Goodbye Trump Card! Hello Squid Game! lol
Let's mention the epic script writing
To bad they can’t speak english
everyone was amazing, thank goodness we didnt see the vip's faces (well apart from that one) but the acting was awful from the VIPs
squid game
Oh, c’mon! Why the heck didn’t he ask Jung Hoyeon a question? Her performance as the main female character in the show was absolutely amazing! Now I’m quite obsessed with her :’)
why they all so FINEE
They're all gorgeous 💙💖
If you really think about it they weren’t really on the tonight show
top show!
nice1
this show  it could be done better
Just finished season 1 last night. Great show. Amazing actors and sets.
#sorry
What a big spoiler douche jimmy
lol did you know? green light and red light is actually translated *The Hisbicus flower has bloomed* not traffic
this is actually good to be top 1 deserve it for sure
I mean....she is STUNNING!!
Ok guys enough with this show, so hyped
lowkey hate how little the attention jimmy gave to Jung Ho-yeon. Queen deserved better
Hey he saved you .. I love it
Their smile in the thumbnail is really heartwarming 💕
I wasnt a big kdrama guy, but this one hit hard, episode 6 was a tear jerker
I can only imagine how much jimmy is butchering their names😂😂
Jimmy's laugh is almost as good as the scene where Il Nam's accidental relieve in bed. Heavily watered and made us all flush of embarrassment of the old man (Jimmy)
Great interview but as always Jimmy is a terrible host. How this show is on air is beyond me, his expressions are so fake it’s insane!
Where's ali ?
squid game is an amazing show 👏👏👏
Wonderful movie with good actors and beautiful Actress, good show, thank you 💕
Am I the only one thinking why is JF so pretentious and fake? Sure we’re all just doing our job but gosh. None of his questions, reactions, laugh seem real.
This kdrama is going to be IKONIC forever
국뽕 크
Too bad they picked such a shitty interviewer
Kpop and kdrama are going crazy all over the world 💜😍
[Spoilers] You know what makes this really weird is that ALL those characters except the one on the far right arw completely dead on the show, there's no room for a backstory, so only one of them will be able to exist in season 2. If we want to watch more Squid Game it will be nees to follow an entirely different group of people.
I love that Jimmy Fallon always respects Korean celebrities whenever they are invited to his show. His show with BTS was also very impressive and caring.  He is now an American show host familiar to Korean people.  감사합니다 지미팰런!!
No joke i would literally learn korean just for them✨✨✨✌️✌️
I’m so proud that I’m Korean! Squid game is the best kdrama that I’ve never seen! I hope this drama become more popular so that many of countries people could watch!
I did not know the girl could speak english
when he says no spoilers xD and he gave it all away LOL oh Jimmy
Wow she is so good at the english
I wasn't shocked by squid game since I saw Alice in borderland first.
Why does jimmy keep stuttering when he talks here’s a clip 2:43
I’ve never been hooked on something as much as this! Fantastic cast and SO gripping - a masterpiece from start to finish!
спрашивают одно, отвечают другое... я тут вообще по-русски пишу... шо за планета у нас?
ALI WHERE R U
fell in love with female lead. :)
Psycho Robot 😂
Is there even 90 country's? Last time I check there was 50
Soo looks like Korean fallon
did he seriously not ask Hoyeon ANY questions?... heh. Maybe Jimmy had a bit too much to drink and forgot...
Jimmy Fallon is actually insane, starting to see it more now
*What makes this Movie/Story different for me !!!...is it looks at the story on Human Terms and not one  dimensional...Like when Vin Diesel is racing in a car ...He's just being a driver. This movie You get to see the Humanity in the Human condition and how fragile life really is...Great Job!!*
Sae-byoek litrrallly grown her following from a few thousand followers to millions overnight. This is the power of internet, more fair chances to everyone, a series from nowhere broke all the records, it's crazy to even think what the future has to over
this tv show is a hidden ad for PlayStation 😊
If there was Ali Abdul (Anupam Tripathi) in the interview it would be better
Resurrection of Ertugrul was an equally famous show. Interview them as well if it doesn’t concern you that they’re muslims.
garbage show for liberals. also where's robert aaron long to take care of that annoying young bitchy actress?
흥미롭네
아 국뽕 치사량온다 자야지..
I mean seriously. They are actors but can’t speak english
Squid Game is the first Korean Drama I have ever watched... like sooooooooooo goooood
Has anyone watched “My name”…another Korean masterclass 😍
For those of u who haven't seen the show and don't like spoilers, don't read the rest of this comment                      Movies 101: If they don't show u a body, the guy isn't dead. The policeman is still alive
I miss Ali in this interview!
Park Hae Soon!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
my god, ho yeon is so beatiful, im in love
Sae byeok is so cute and stunning in that dress
한국인 댓글 없누 ㅋㅋ
Jimmy's Korean pronunciation's getting better and better.
They Are Gorgeous. Goodness.   After Pronouncing Their Names So Well, Jimmy, Never Ever Mess Up An African Guests Name On Your Show. I Can Tell You Did Your Homework.
Junho💜
And what about HER?? She is the only female one there and she is the only one who was ignored. Why?? I was looking forward to hearing her.
Where is Anupam tripathi????😠😠😠😠
I don't watch Jimmy that much but even I can see that he's nervous or maybe too excited? Idk lol
Where is Ali?
Still Jimmy is annoying as f.
the most important thing is without blacks, which is strange for netflix
Bruh Jung Ho-yeon just so cute and pretty i can't take it😭✋
kind of weird hearing main character guy in his regular voice, the English dub he sound more chill
But this Scary doll looks like Stormi Websters ( Daughter of  Travis Scott - Kylie Jenner ) Birthday Theme Doll !!
I thumbed up for the cast not for Jimmy coz he is cringe and awkward interviewer
Faloon: here are the star of Squid Game; Ho Lee Fuk, Wee Tu Low, Bang Ding Ow, and Fook Mi Naw
1st of all how does the actors understand the question. 2nd How are the subtitles so quick, it's live isn't it?
I wish the interviews could have gone on longer. I was grinning madly the whole time!
Her English is so adorableee
No spoilers as he proceeds to explain what happens in the first episode followed by a clip showing one of the best scenes from the first episode 💀
Korean culture growing so much globally! Wow
Where is ali 😭
Listening to Jimmy Fallon is so painful I can’t finish the interview
i'm sure he practiced saying those names
Come on Netflix - make a second season please !
so much golems here en dépit de ant
Jimmy Fallon laugh looks so forced and even more awkward with the guests not being in person
= o E HE E HE E HE ddooooo dooo daaaaaaaa da da da da
This was a good show, but where the fuck is Ali man? Jimmy, dude why????
Thank you putting the laugh tracks in so I know when to laugh
Jimmy just ignored the only woman in the interview - didn't even address anything she said (in his spoken language at that) 🤔
Ha-joon was the best part of the show for me, He was like a freaking Bond or MI6 Agent  taken Disguises and names. lol
Jimmy became so awkward interviewing...
She's so damn sexy to me😂😂😂
phony jimmy laugh @ 4:52
The show is alright. I get the hype behind it but I mean its meh
God I cant stand this guy, wish he took a part in the squid game...
Cho Sang-woo went to SNU! I swear to Jebus!
She’s so beautiful omg 😍
No spoilers lol spoils it before saying that -.- lol
Ail abdul helped him, he did such a great job in this entire series
Omggg!!!!!I love squid game!!!even though I didn't understand anything because I'm not English :( ARGHH YUO ARE SO CUTEEE ✨✌️🌈❤️I WANT SEA-BYEOK >:(
Lee, Jung-jae's best moments in Korean TV and films Hourglass (1995) : @ Maid (2010) : @ Thieves (2012) : @ New World (2013) : @ Compilation : @
They deserve Emmy award
I loved this show! Although I was kind of bummed when I heard that the translations were way off. Both in subs and dubs. It was still good, though.
4:50 such a fake laugh
The fake laughing and loud "OAAHHHH" feels like torture to hear - but it also just sounds insulting to the cast because it just sounds so disingenuous.
I hv heard abt chulsoo from a comic lolll
i've never seen such a perfect show like this one. seriously, i'm in love. the cast is perfect and amazing. netflix, i'm beggin u for another season
I have the sudden urge to punch Jimmy in the face because he never tried to interact with Jung Hoyeon. Even when she answered a question she wasn’t even asked, he just said “yeah” arrogantly. If I was her I would feel irrelevant
Jung Hoyun, She is very pretty now  When she was 'Sebyuk, she was very cute!!!  She is global top model!!!
Where Is Ali
We need part 2 already
I have watched the entire episodes and I am so impressed.  Looking forward hopefully for season 2 (if there is)
Jimmy why not interact with the female? She had to speak on her own you didn't even ask her anything
Fakest laugh award goes to..........
Prize money was 45.6 Billion Won. Guess who win it? Player 456 !!!
why is ali so less recognised?
This was a little awkward but lol
I just watch the Series
From the first second of the first episode, to the last is just pure acting and keeps you wanting more. I haven't enjoyed a series in a long time  well done.
Kool-rea!
It is a perfect show for America  Some socialism, some communism, some anti capitalism, some anti whiteman-ism, and some multiculturalism. It was very settled though but I binged it in two days.
wasnt the protagonist to be unlikable?
Serious question there, why does half Korean sentences end in ''mida''
I love how Squid Game literally reminds us that everything you need to learn in life... it all starts with us as kids messing around on the playground. Or with bullies in the school cafeteria. It's all relevant!
오징어게임 ftw
I’m sorry but why did Ho Yeon the only woman here not even get a question about her character? He just asked what the doll was. I feel like everyone got an actual question about the show where they could elaborate on their artistry. Kinda disappointed in that tbh.
I finished the season of Squid  game in one night !
Where is Ali?
He didn’t even ask the female actress a question!!! She was great in the series!
I guess I’ll watch squid game tonight
안녕안녕~!
Their skin, they’re all glowing lol
It's funny bc this show was rejected originally
Jimmy is so over the top!
Onde está o senhor e o estrangeiro nessa entrevista?
they betrayed my boy ali even in real life...
I was cracking up, so hard when Gi hun (don’t know his real name) was re-enacting the accidental laughing scene
Jung Ho-yeon is so beautiful
I can't explain it but this interview has Caesar Flickerman energy 🤣 Probably the "I love it!" at the end.
My God Fallon, so fake
I hate how everyone is all of a sudden a big fan of K-drama now smh
South Korea is famous for BTS,Blackpink,Psy,and many K-dramas,and movies..but the most attractive thing of our country is  fantastic scenery of many mountains and beaches..I hope you 2 visit Korea and enjoy travle and eat tasteful Korean food..if you want 2 know awesome places 2 visit,I will introduce you many fantastic places
Why did he not ask her any questions? Probably just badly cut but wtf how rude is that
MY MATHS TEACHER KNOWS ABOUT SQUID GAME IT'S THAT FAMOUS HERE
wow thanks for the spoilers jimmy
I review Squid Game on my channel for the symbolism and mysticism. If you can’t get enough check this out .
0:09 I wonder how long it took Jimmy to rehearse this part
I'm in love with this woman ❤
But what about Ali???? Rip him for being excluded
the way Hoyeon says “thank you for having us!” is wholesome
jimmy fallon fake laugh 4:52
I don't care what others say about it, but for me Lee Jung-jae's portrayal of Gi Hun was one of the most impressive acting performances I have ever seen.  Gi Hun's character (next to Sang woo) was one of the most complex and multifaceted and I'm glad the director was able to win such a talented actor for it. Lee Jung-jae played Gi Hun so masterfully and believably that I suffered with him for the entire series and rarely have I been so emotionally moved. .
Is Jimmy on drugs? LOL
4:56 FAKES ASS LAUGH LOL
I LOVE THESE ACTORS!!!!!  I have watched 'Squid Game' 4 times.  I'm obsessed with these characters.
Jimmy fanboying as hell
Where's Ali?
This Horror Show Shows Who We Are A student of mine told me about a new show called “Squid Game.” It is a South Korean “thriller series,” as they call it, which has become a pop culture phenomenon and is the no. 1 show in more than 90 countries. The show presents several hundred people who are all in great financial debt and in dire emotional states. The producers pit them against each other, even if they are very close, and make them hate each other. The winner takes millions of dollars, and the others are killed. This show wouldn’t be so horrifying if it didn’t portray our true nature. The very fact that we watch such a show enthusiastically is proof that underneath the “civilized” façade, our nature is as the show depicts. It works like a magnet. We love to watch the struggle between good and evil, as long as we are safe from the consequences of the battle. The thing is that in this show, there is no good; there is only evil.  Indeed, humans are the worst being in reality. What makes us so uniquely evil is the fact that we explicitly want to harm others. We do not want to eat others because we will starve unless we do so; we want to see them suffer! We derive pleasure from others’ pain, and derive the most pleasure when we are the ones inflicting it. We often say that reality is like a jungle, where the strong eat the weak. However, in the jungle, the strong do not want to destroy the weak; they want to eat. Once they are full, they want to sleep and play, and not kill or hurt for fun. In the human jungle, we do not want to eat other people; we want to see them hurting! This is why the natural jungle thrives without any laws while the human jungle, which we mistakenly refer to as “civilization,” is disintegrating despite the laws that strive to limit our barbarity. If we had any hopes of finding goodness in human nature, “Squid Game,” and mainly its popularity, proves that we have nothing to hope for when it comes to human nature. If we can create such shows, and if they can be so popular, then we can do such horrors in real life. The only possible good that can come out of such a show is the realization that it is not fantasy, but an authentic depiction of who we are. Maybe if we realize this, we will be willing to do something about changing ourselves. The current trend is to dull our awareness of the human horror show we live in by making cannabis available and legal. Indeed, the more we learn about human nature, the more we realize that perhaps it is better to numb ourselves through life until it’s over. For now, we’re cheering at the sight of other people suffering, much like people used to cheer at the sight of poor men fighting against lions in ancient Rome. Only if we realize that it is not okay to be like that, our minds might open to other options. If such a diabolical program can be the no. 1 show in more than 90 countries, it means that the entire world is immersed in unhinged viciousness. There is a solution, but it is demanding and must encompass the entire world if it is to succeed. To change who we are, we must initiate a worldwide educational process where such programs are forbidden and pro-human-connection programs are produced and aired. Even if they are not popular, at first, we cannot allow ourselves to be exposed to the violent poison and culture of narcissism that we consume today. They may be sweet, but they are lethal. If people don’t want to watch shows about human connection, they can put aside their media devices and simply talk to one another. This will already be a major improvement to the current situation. It may not sound like fun, but what is the option? To live out the “Squid Game.” Besides, after some practice, we will discover that connection and care are far more rewarding and pleasant than destruction and cruelty, and do not carry the negative side effect that is our current culture.
이정재를 94년도부터 좋아했었는데 "느낌"이라는 드라마부터... 그리고 "정사"라는 영화를 보고 아주 열렬히 사랑했었고... 이제는 "오징어게임"을 보고 인간적인 정에 이끌린다~
4:50. Jimmy's laugh is so fake and creepy. He could be the brother of the psyco woman in Squid Game....
Where is poor Ali? I think he should have been included.
https://youtu.be/oqk1DF5wApUggg
Should've talked more to Jung Ho-yeon
what i really sad about this interview is, they never come back for squid game seaseon 2.
Why would you tell people they get shot?! Wtf. Just say they get eliminated.
Another stupid  tv show for Future psychopath Thanks to Netflix 🤦🏻‍♂️
Jimmy Garbage Fallon
No production company would pick it up then Netflix took a chance look how it blew up
It's not only squid game that went big, parasite and train to busan are also really high at the top.  And there are many hidden gems for the internationals to find out about.
Thanks alot for showing Ali who is an indian, as a Pakistani player 💖👍
The fact that the girl only speaks English 😂 Though The series are so delightful and very creative
I cannot watch something where people are being tortured. I think it’s sad that’s the number one show. It goes to show, the world has too many sociopaths who find torture entertaining. It’s the same sociopaths who watch The Bachelor and Housewives
God damn the comments show how ignorant and stupid most of you are. Acting like this is the first good kdrama show ever. Just because you don't watch shows from other countries doesn't mean this is the first best one. And to say their acting is amazing is a reach. Some of the characters acting in this was as bad as the acting in 90's jackie chan movies. If you little children even know who that is.
I find it messed up they are calling only these members the main cast members.
In Christ Jesus Victorious name, may every ingredient in the stab, with perfect alchemy be changed to water... and that manipulated DNA be miraculously converted back to God’s perfect design. May any evil plans of tracking and control via AI short circuit and any 5geee interaction with these ingredients be intercepted by the mighty hand of Jesus. No ill health effects on anyone. Perfect almighty protection and broken evil alterior motives in Christ Jesus Holy Name. All evil spirits associated with anything against humanity be bound and cast into the courts of heaven for the ultimate Judgement and if no repentance be thrown into eternal blazing fire.  AMEN❣️🙏🏼
2012 Gangnam Style, 2021 Squid Game, once in a while Korea always takes over the world
Prison playbook is also good.
Jimmy's laugh...
no spoilers but he spoiled the fk out of red light green light.....
The girl story fucking boring
3.2 K people that voted down on this clip probably are either Trump Supporters, Anti Vax, Anti Science, Anti anyone that doesn't look like them(AKA. White) and or North Korea haha.
I watched all 9 episode of Squid game. Final game was starting game when they are young they played the same game.
Why is Jimmy yelling the whole time? So off-putting, especiialy considering their lovely more reserved personalities
This is K-DRAMA I would Die to watch ....Not The love stories and all ..that ....
The charming bottom rapidly tap because jeans monthly hug lest a abundant plier. utter,  flagrant crayon
Fallon is so cringe.
No spoilers in this show.... proceeds to show video of squid game... 😑
Jimmy pronouncing those names is the hardest thing he’s ever done 😂
Where is ali?
There are more than 4 important members to the squid games where are they??🧐🧐🧐🧐
why I didn't see. this movie I will tell you because they onely make corona cases
Jimmy 😂😂 just saw Ur Funny half nakd picture posted by John Cena on his insta handle 🤣🤣🤣🤣
😍😍😍😍😍😍
So this is the kid that replaced Johnny Carson!
So Ali really is dead huh 🤔
Where is Ali? You betrayed him Jimmy...
Lol. Love how he says “No Spoilers” after he already revealed the whole “red light, green light” premise.
Wonder how they understood what jimmy was saying
Why is no one talking about Ali !!!!!!!
The show was overrated
Not sure why in every interview online, they don't include the Indian guy, perhaps a little racist....That China had the monopoly in the Asian region lol
It is a great accomplishment! The actors speak their mother tongue and they are still on US popular late night show! Bravo!
I AM IN LOOOOVE FOR SQUID GAME OMG
Why is jimmy always drunk
It’s sad how sae-Byeok(tell me if I spelled it wrong) friend died(idk if shes her friend) like the way she fell I cried so hard 😭
5:00 "I'm not giving any spoilers tonight!"  After literally telling what the first episode was about 2 minutes beforehand 🤣🤣
I love the squid game cast, but holy fkn hell! Jimmy Fallon is such a fake human. He lacks any real personality. Literally has to force himself to come across as falsely charming. But it’s so obviously fake that it’s cringey. I hate seeing him.. all the time and every time. What a dry personality for a guy they would choose to be a late night TV host.   Why does it seem like, out of all the options there are in the world, they would end up with a weirdo like him? All the real charming, and real funny people. This guy is a wreck.
the biggest show in the world and the biggest artists in the world are from korea. just wow
im so happy squid game sparked the kdrama hype!!! hell yeah!
we need il nam on the show, old man was brillaint
Who would "down vote" this vid?? 3.1K???
yup i became hooked love this series
Korea squid game parody movie  https://youtu.be/e1d04U4TC7I
"I'm not giving any spoilers tonight ..." except that losing contestants get shot. Thanks, Jimmy.
wait where's ali?
5:08
Dear Indian celebs theyare talking in native language and you boloody talk in English
Bitcoin Dogecoin buy
Gotta love "jimmy faller"
Jimmy is insufferable.
Wow, his son was born 10 minutes before the release of the show. Amazing experience for a first time Dad.
Why didn't you guys invited Anupam Tripathy?
the translation sucks.
At 02:10 is how I laugh when my mom tells me a joke that’s not funny but I need to borrow some money
Being an asian I am very happy and proud
Korea focusing on doing good and exciting movies and series that they put effort and soul in which goes world famous for that reason while Hollywood and western movies and series focus more on political correctness, activism and lazy writing because of easy money which makes so many movies and series flop, movie ratings have droped pretty much the last years. These movies only get big because they have famous people in it and a lot of advertising.
I'm happy for hae soo
ASIA TIME!
1:36 infian culture
We all know the creator of squid games rocks with Sony and PlayStation
that girl skinny azz heck ,, wow
There was also an Indian Series named "Scam 1992" but Jimmy would never ever call them cause the Americans are like the Koreans more than the Indians because of the BTS.
W😠😶‍🌫️😘😘
And where is ali????????
I'm not saying that the show is bad, but being in top 10 on Netflix is not that big of a deal. When most of the time there is nothing new to watch there. Don't know if its just me but somethimes I feel I spend more time to decide on what to watch, than actually watching something. So yea... when Netflix put something new of course everybody would watch it. The Squd Game is good though.
You’d think that, with all the Korean celebrities that Jimmy’s interviewed, that he might’ve picked some up by now. 🧐
I wonder, does Jimmy Fallon understand Korean or did someone interpret to him which got cut out here? I can see the earpieces in the cast members, but nothing for Jimmy....
This ensemble  is perfect
It's a blockbuster movie
I love them
Please give all the Emmys to Squid Game. They cast and crew deserve it.
The way she says grr 🥵
Just three words to describe #Squid game : A Bloody Masterpieces 😍😍
67 the girl dies
That's actually a really bad interview...
This is really wooden
Korean movies and series just keep getting better and better, there's so much originality unlike hollywood.
I watched squid game and I realise money is jst a shit of paper real thing is family
I love how her accent comes through as she speaks. She's beautiful.
Ali should have been in that interview too.
와... 신기하다
Idol  pataka ni ko antie hindi ko wach squid game hai na ko🙄🙄
That symbols looks like playstation symbols
As an Indian , I'm very proud that an Indian , whose name is Anupam Tripathi , ( show name  Ali ) has acted in this series.
4:50 prepare for the most fake laugh ever.
Perverted movie people who made it might be Haunted by the "Mangwoma "Doll or Glass bridge in their very dreams!!!!  !!
Sae beyok speaks such good English wow
That thing is in textbooks?!
Where is Ali? He should be at the forefront of this cast, he was one of the best and most memorable of characters of the show.
I'm slightly obsessed with the cast. They're so awesome 🙌🙌
Hands down the most original and inventive TV series I've ever seen! A masterpiece - even with English dubbing and cultural references that flew over my head.
WoW.  Millions of people watching people being tortured and killed.  Sitting in their living rooms with popcorn and family??  Watching other human beings suffering, screaming, in pain...for entertainment.  Finding this fun.  Finding this good.  Making TikTok videos that little children watch... Little children who go out to the playground and start beating each other up "just like the movie".  This is sick, and psychologically destructive and poisonous.  It is NOT normal for a human being to get pleasure out of watching others experiencing pain and horror.  Who are you people???  Time to take a good look in the mirror.  Why binge away your life on filling your brain with horror??  Why??  There are real people out in the world who need help.  Get up off the couch and do something good for someone...instead of this...insanity.
I wish the actor playing Ali was on there.  He was my favorite.  I hope these actors can be nominated for Emmys next year, not sure if it counts since it's a foreign film.
4:47 Just checked and I didn't notice it before, but now it's so obvious and it's awesome that that made it into the final cut lol
Beautiful people. Blessings. I loved every episode so much. ( Marbels kill me)
Okay  why is Ali not here? 😆.... even though His role was shored-lived it was enough to leave an Everlasting impression on my mind because of his acting!. I wish Ali was also here
Huge respect to all the casts😌❤
Still don’t believe this guy in the red sweater is 38 years old…
Why is the Indian actor never in any of these!! He is one of the most important characters in the show as well!!!
Sang woo is so attracted irl wthhh
This awesome cast is so wholesome. I love them.
Am I the only one annoyed that he didn’t exactly ask the girl much questions especially about her character or personal life😕
Jimmy : No spoilers   Also Jimmy : If the doll turns her head and catches you move, you get shot
I can just picture Jimmy practicing the actor's names 20 times before coming out.
I wonder why the Cop’s promoting it everywhere instead of Ali’s actor, I feel like he had a bigger role.
Jimmy Fallon is the goat. I love the inclusion and also that he actually cares. He’s not just asking fluffy questions. He’s asking relevant questions that he would ask anyone else. He actually does some research. He’s the best
I want Ali to part of this too, we all loved him and he is so underrated 😫
Nah that straw scene, when it happened, I knew he was really trying not to mess it up! I could feel it hahaha! It's like tying your shoes in the middle of a game
❤️
South Korean people are so gentle ❤️
Good show. Deep hidden meanings.  Terrifying situation to be in.
I thought the dubbing would be distracting but it surprisingly wasn’t.
Mad, mad world
GG. https://youtu.be/mo0oOCMruoM
they all so adorable
Her English is so good!
Man, I have been following Korean shows for a while including films. The level of acting is above superior. Train to Busan is by far the best zombie movie I have seen to date. Please keep making more projects.
The world has slept on Korean talents for so long now it’s their time to shine globally
Jimmy is more awkward than me and I’m so fucking awkward lol
If you guys wanna have their skin at that age, start using retinol.. Korean people start using skincare from high school!
How he‘s just casually explaining „red light green light“ wrong 🤣
Jimmy's fake laugh in 4:53💀
yeah... perfect show for wall street type psychopaths...
Jimmy askin the lamest questions I wish I could ask them some questions
Until I watched this show I never realized how awesome the Korean language is to hear!
I Increased The Forces of My Love & Chased Down Evil & Got To The Truth For You OK   You Are lied To So Bad By Predijudgitism ( Evil ) Hid Behind Religion & Hid A War From You So You Never Fight Back Predijudgitism & Hate ( Evil ) & Deliver Your Souls To Heaven  Evil Started A War With Heaven A Long Long Time Ago Heavens Not Going To Lose The War Anymore (    https://youtu.be/MBtd6wKFfIk
Just for the record the amount of people that have watched Squid Game has surpassed the amount of people who watched SuperBowl LIV
I absolutely loved squid game.brilliant cadt.great concept and so well done
Why hasn't Ali been invited to any of these interviews? He's the fan favorite
I really enjoyed the series, however I was particularly disturbed by the portrayal of the ‘VIP’s. I was wondering: “Is this what South Koreans think Westerners behave?”
Damn my boy jimmy really asked all the dudes a question but not my girl sae byeok
the cop is SO not dead
Lee Jung-jae was great in the mafia movie New World.
5:43 baby squid 🥺🥺
But in the intro you said a very famous show… so why does he need to tell what the show is about?
uh i think jimmy's too cringe but hoyeon is pretty cute! i love this girl
I can see dead people
Hae soo is so fine
Wow wow wow
He didn't ask the beautiful Jung Ho-yeo one direct question. Dissapointing.
The movie isn't about something cheerfull or happy thats why Lee jung-jae didn't wanna turn this into a laughable interview and kept himself pretty serious  for the most of it, the movie is dediced to people who commited suicide and lived in big powerty.. sry to rain on your parade but that's how it is.
The way she says girl is too cute
Love this show, but Fallon is so embarrassing, how does this dude still have this show after all these years
U should have invited ali too
Korean television really is where it's at. It's so refreshing and a nice break from lawyer, cop, doctor, and cartel shows in the US. I cannot watch one more knock off of Breaking Bad.
HoYeon is so fine 😍😍
all of them are so gorgeous wtf
"Jigeum, right now!" - Park Hae-soo, 2021
It’s like people never seen Alice in Borderland.
This show is so overrated ! So so so overrated!!
So she can be this beautiful, I don't believe women anymore...
i love them so much
Had no idea Lee Jung-jae was so dashing in real life
Korean dramas is the best in the world I think. My Dad has been telling our family 30 years ago. Story is nothing compared to other movies I’ve watched internationally. K Drama is always original and gets kinda twisted at the end and makes you think and feel etc.. I’m glad K Drama is finally getting recognized 🙏🏼☺️
好好，这个剧
Hae-soo is so fricking handsome!
In addition, Mr. JungJae Lee, he was arrested two times for drunk driving in South Korea. Very bad actor with no responsible mind set. His drunk driving arrests were reported by the South Korean newspapers in 1999 & 2002. He denied his driving and pointed his manager for driving but the police found him guilty for drunk driving after interrogations. He is a real bad guy who should not be salvaged.
Squid game is just amazing ❤️
Wanted to see *Ali Abdul* ...
jimmy Fallon is a terrible interviewer
Jimmy looks more excited then the real crew. What’s up Jim.
WHERE IS ALI
Is the Beggining guy happy that people are enjoying squid or coz he is getting a lot of won
I think south korea gono be very famous and very rich in this whole world 🌎 * BTS *BLACKPINK  *SQUID GAME  AND WHAT MORE.........
Where is the poor English dubbing?
Why can only one person english?
Man I don't see the actor for Ali in any of these. I was happy to see Koreans, who *ahem* are notorious for not liking brown people actually cast him. but thats about it, I don't see him anywhere else.
If there is a contest, I'm out... 😮😱😀
Best movie 🥺♥️🟥🔴🔺️
Ali is a hero and he didnt even needed to die
Everyone:  "So glad Korean shows are getting recognition in America."  Every Good writer around the world:   Cause America is trying to pander to China and making total fucking garbage.
So proud of the homeland! Jimmy loves it lol
Damn jimmy really struggling interviewing them, and god damn his fake ass laugh when they talking about the coffee cup straw scene
I realised when Hae-Soo said "I wanna meet Jimmy brother", at 1:58 he meant Jimmy hyung in Korean and that just melts my heart. I love how they carry their culture so close to their hearts 🥺❤
god I hate Jimmy Fallon, but I must watch this content for the Squid Game Actors :)))
This would’ve been so much better with Conan.
Who wants Ali in this interview?
Once you start watching Korean dramas, you can't get out of it. For those who haven't seen it yet, "My Mister", "Stranger", "Thank you", <<< Let's get started.
Yes
Where is Ali ??? 😭😭😭
I love ❤️ the movie 🎥.. So much!!. .. even the guy that played in cobra movie
One like for Ali👇
OH my god the woman is sooo skinny she looks sick
I love this actors
number 1 in 90 countries? that's insane
america has been leading in the television world for sometime and i can't express how happy i am that Korea has produced one of the best shows i have ever seen i can not wait to see their future plans hold
jimmy fallon: no spoilers also jimmy: *shows th doll and talk about the kiling nd the scene where ali saved gi-hun*
Top top
Is Jimmy Fallon on drugs on this one?  Jeez !
geez jimmy’s laugh is so fake.. can’t get past it.
Love that Ali scene, true hero.
When the guy said "Right now" it made me LOL so hard.
Baby Squid. Cute lol
Cant wait for season 2
All the actors played their characters so great.
New daddy in town Mr Hae Soo.
kdramas are gonna explode because of this show, even though they are already very popular.
I want more of them!
I love this show. People crazy 🤪 it's one thing that never seems to amaze me. Squid game is wild.
Big time for K directors and artists!! Incredible talents 👏👏👏 #parasite #squidgame
Hiring a foreigner really sold it for me. Opened so many potential doors, as well as made the show better. Ali's last scene broke my heart. So proud of all the actors, and Jung Ho for her first time acting! talented!!
why was ali not invited?
Lmao Jimmy’s laugh at 4:52 couldn’t sound more fake 😂😂
Not much diversity in squid game is there? In accordance with leftist guidelines this show needs to be cancelled
I am requesting him to call Ali of squid game if he takes another interview of the show.....🇮🇳🇮🇳
@4:49
Jimmy’s fake laughing
오징어 게임
Why was Ho-Yeon ( the only woman)  asked about the doll and everyone else had these really profound questions. Yeah good interview but why is it always women who get the soft or sexy questions.
1:34 Jimmy : When did you realize the show became so big? Hae-Soo: *Right now*
They are so humble and down to earth. I have never seen K drama before. Just loved it..
I hope Kim Jong Un doesn't get in a jealous fit of rage and declare war since the south is getting all this attention.
everyone is so humble and amazing !
Where is ali??
Jung Ho-yeon marry me
should’ve invited anupam tripathi too
“ I won’t give any spoilers” after spoiling what happens in the first game 😭
Sh&t, jimmy's fake laugh is harder to watch and hear in this interview
04:02 is it different what jimmy was asking and what he was answering  plzz tell my eng. is weak
This cast made me fall in love with acting and cinema again. I think to put Hollywood out of the picture and bring the World in to watch is the healthiest thing for the industry at the moment.
Is anyone else annoyed be Jimmy's interviewing skills, I don't know if he's nervous or isn't interested it enough but he is very very awkward
I'm sad they didn't ask her any questions... at least on this clip :(
My English  Accent is better then the host😷
Why did he ignore the girl he didn’t even ask her a real question
He completely ignored sabeyok
Thanks for the video
Even Korean psych thriller movie is so dark it is well done 👍
First kpop broke all records and now it's kdrama... 💥
All the characters are very likeable and their background story are deeply relatable, even the front man and the gangster have interesting characters.. only the foreigners are the cringest part of the series..
Is it true?... That in Squid Game, the salesman (Gong Yoo) was on his way to Busan?
Where's ali
Jimmy... Relax!! 🤣
Love the cast ! Jimmy is a bit annoying ...
Lee Jungjae is one of my favorite Korean actors. I recommend Il Mare, the original version of The Lake House.
South korean wave spreading all over the world
First Kingdom (Koreans explained how zombie tv shows should be done, THANK YOU). And now this.
This interview is just awkward and cringey  Its because of the language barrier  The laugh sounds really forced  I think not doing the interview would've been better
The fakeness of jimmy fallon is just astonishing. He matches the levels of indian propaganda media
I am glad that they didn't show who caught him because people would be more curious and end up watching it
Hope this show stops when its appropriate and doesn't end up being a game of thrones with awful seasons in the end. Again i was not gona watch it cause of hype but finally the hype was worth it. My dumbass watched in english dub for 4 seasons then switched to Korean where it felt natural.
4:50 that is the fakest laugh I’ve ever heard.
Korean film/television has always been amazing if not better than a lot of the garbage we get spoon fed in America 🤣 a lot of you just love to hop on a band wagon.
Nice to see asian media getting more global recognition. The storytelling, originality and lack of creative restraints (pc culture bs) leads to far superior media content.  We have overly polished, tacky, generic shows and movies littered with agenda political or otherwise. They see storytelling as an art form and whether its a real life show/movie or an anime series that is the artwork.  In this age of political correctness and pandering around touchy subject matter people may be more aware of the feelings of others but creativity and self expression has really taken a hit.   I miss series and movies that delved into the taboo subjects and unfiltered comedy. No subject should be too offensive or non confirmative especially in the fields of fictional media and comedy as they are there to explore society and its issues or to extrapolate from personal experience and opinion.   Comedy itself takes a look at society and mocks nonsensical rules, behaviour or other occurrences. This turns real life issues and subjects into humour helping to normalise and de-stigmatise, bringing people from different backgrounds (race, gender, ethnicity, religion ect) closer together. By fostering understanding and allowing people with little in common to share a laugh over some of the issues, stereotypes, interactions or more heavy subject matter we can both have a laugh and forget about our worries and realise we have more in common than perhaps we first thought.
Squid game got famous in such a short time hardwork always pays off
"not gonna reveal any spoilers tonight"...proceeds to literally show us a spoiler on screen.
this makes me miss conan
i love them
Pretty sure it is hate that the show got picked up now, instead of back in 2008; Because I am not sure if it would have been as popular back then.
Squid Game > Crazy Rich Asians
Alice In Borderland is Better. The main character, robs an old man of marbles, goes through the whole game trying to win, gets the money, starts spending it and then has a moral turn around. Stupid show with a stupid ending. But the games were fun. That’s it.
Says he isn’t giving out any spoilers but also told everyone what happens when you get caught moving lmao
How funny Jimmy understand Korean 😩
God i cant believe people in Korea watched this interview and now think all Americans act like clowns like Jimmy Fallon
girrr lol she said girrr
I loved them
How is this idiot allowed to host a show? He sounds like a total fool with no intellect whatsoever.
Excellent cast and such great acting! It’d be fun to ask what their favorite game was a kid and if it was featured in the show….Jimmy Fallon is still annoying.
fallon is faking his laughs.
Gentleman in the red sweater is so handsome 🤩
Finally a different kind of story. It had to be from another country. Most of the best series on Netflix nowadays come from other parts of the world. The U.S still with the same scripts and spending most of the budget on CGI in series and movies.
Best show
How does the world not realise your resignating with this!!!!!!  Because it's what's going on in real life right now! ✅
I love Korean culture and it’s wholesomeness.
THEYRE SO CUTE AND SWEET
So glad to see the Kdrama actors on US mainstream TV! Been watching Kdramas for so many years! So happy for them.
Jimmy Fallon could ruin a wet dream.
How are they just talking to each other in different languages?
Just proof that if something is good, then it can't be ignored. No politics about it. Squid Game was stunning cinematic artwork.
I watched this show 2 times 👏🙏❤
One person speaks English and he talks to her least🙄 Fallon is such a mysoginist against women👎
Oh man this is driving me crazy 😦😧💜💜💜💜💜💜
And thankfully Jimmy wasn’t centring his questions on other dramas or movies! Although I think he could have been more inclusive of the actress and ask more things about the Korean upcoming movies, industry, etc… like he would do to Hollywood actors
South Korea is taking over the entertainment industry, Hollywood is fading
holy shit i didnt recognise gi hun, he doesn't look hopeless as his character which you could really feel. that means his acting was amazing lol
Epic
대박
I’m not even Korean but I’m so proud for Korean dramas finally getting the recognition it deserves!!!! Especially this one, so so so amazing!
Loved it
This show blew my mind.
Lord help me. Jung Hoyeon  HOOOT.
I binged watch Squid Game this weekend and it is good, a lot of deaths.  it seems everybody dies on the show.
Why is this so awkward and uncomfortable to watch lmao
S. Korea doing a great job exporting and spreading its culture to the entire world.
Jimmy annoys me
squid game was good because of less diversity!
It’s been a while since I’ve seen a cast fit so perfectly together and play off of each other so naturally with their acting.   They should be very proud of all of their work.
*THE AMOUNT OF MEMORISING IT MUST HAVE TAKEN TO REMEMBER THEM NAMES FOR AN INTRODUCTION* 🤣
WHAT A SHOW! ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH!
I got beef with whoever told Park Hae-soo and Wi Ha-joon to come clothed.....
Hoyeon's English is so cute 😂😂
Lol jimmy be stuttering
just finished the first season. Amazing series indeed. Highly recommended!
손!
3:50
Imagine being hoeyon jung. SHE IS AMAZING!!! SHE’S AN AMAZING MODEL, SHE’S IS ONE OF THE SIDE CHARACTER OF THE BIGGEST TY SHOW IN HISTORY, WHICH WAS HER FIRST ACTING ROLE AND AUDITION BY THE WAY, AND IS THE MOST FOLLOWED KOREAN ACTRESS
6:35 every fans reaction to that scene
Hi
I’m not giving any spoilers Jimmy says. ‘If they move they get shot’ 🛎 end
Gi-Hun, you da best!
anytime something cost 1.99$ i legit think of the homie, Ali NO...better character
So happy for them. Imagine just a month ago for them and now they’re a part of the worlds most popular TV show.
I love how  HoYeon Jung knows a lot of english
the fake laugh is soo damn obvious and annoying
It's all good famous and all but there are hardly any game, and too much drama, and later plot sucks😂😂😂😂😂I think it's too much hype for this series. Thank you✌️
best kdrama in 2021.
Love how they all seem so humble and sweet. Loved the show and the characters! I am officially a fan of South Korea. These actors are all so damn talented. And they are all so cute too <3 I ended up watching the show only because that "thumbnail" of the weird creepy doll kept popping up on Netflix (I'm from Denmark) so I was like, what the f**k is this shit, and then it sounded intriguing, but I never expected it to have such a huge impact on me. I was enchanted! And that twist... I seldom get that surprised by twists, but damn! This one totally tricked me and it blew my mind. The best twists are those you never saw coming but in hindsight, you can't believe you never saw it coming. Amazing! Top-notch storytelling and plotting! 5 out of 5 stars from here.
Am I the only one who is cringing of Jimmy? Like dude, why are you overreacting. Jdjdjs This seems so fake, I mean his reactions and emotions
koreamania in full bloom...
4:50 that’s the fakest laugh I’ve ever heard in my entire life 😂
i may be late but atleast i still come here to watch them.. i  heart you squid game cast!!!
What is it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciPpmCh9peM
WHERE IS ALI
Can he understand what they say? Like I'm curious 😂🤔
The cast is great, but the interview is ruin by the Host. Lister him is pretty painful, he looks and act like drunk...
Not jimmy faking his laugh 😭😆
I see Jimmy stuttering for the first time 😂..
Where is Ali he was so good
It is bigger than.....Uh Su😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
How he know how to say there names tho and remember😂😂
Hollywood needs to learn from Korean movie making
Bring on season 2
Too much violence
Ali should have been a part too Along with the old man.
He didn't direct Ho-yeon a single question. Either that or they edited it out -_-
The plot is truly something any human can relate too and I think that's why the world loves it
Jimmy's fake laugh strikes again
Where is old Uncle,he was most badass character
Where's the Toilet girl 😭😭
Deok su and Ali should have been there too. They played legendary characters as well.
Where is Ali Abdul? 🥺
I love how Korea is dominating the world in terms of drama and music😊
Hae soo's so good at acting that we hate him in the show
자랑스러운 배우들💕 어릴때 했던 놀이가 이렇게 드라마에서 큰 역할을 했다니 감독님 정말 대단하신듯^^
Jimmy: "no spoilers, I'm not giving any spoilers tonight, so everyone knows" also Jimmy 2 minutes earlier: "so there's this doll that shoots you dead when you lose the game"
Jimmy was running over his sentences a lot too the point where it was kinda hard too understand sometimes😅😅♥️ but I enjoyed the interview and the cast and jimmy too
What are people relating too? " the children's games"...lol. nah, how about because we all realise we are living in late stage capitalism, and a lot of us would die for the chance to be rich.
i love how this show has a predominantly asian cast, representation really does matter. especially since this show is doing so well and it's being exposed to huge audiences.
Jimmy has gotten really cringey and creepy lately...
What a beautiful world. Number 1 show is people killing other people for enjoyment. Great 👍
There are 2 versions of English subtitles for the series Squid Game. One is 'English' and the other one is 'English CC'. The subtitle 'English' is good enough but 'English CC' is terribly horrible. I've heard that somebody mentioned about this issue on Twitter, and I believe the person was talking about 'English CC'. Unfortunately, Netflix recently revised the good one 'English', which means Netflix does not even know what the problem is. Guys. Please click the subtitle button saying 'English', not 'English CC'. I'm a South Korean who understands English. Believe me.
usa holiwood shit like hollyshith....
usa  bravo dumb ass hollywood shit
Ali Abdul ?
There missing Ali.sad :(
Excellent actors
오징어 게임 너무 재미있어요
Do good work and ppl will wake up and love you...
The girl might be one of the most beautiful ppl I’ve ever seen
Son hermosos.
Why does it have to be fallon?
Squid games screams diversity
Great jimmy show. I love it 💗💗💗😍
Why wasn't Ali invited?
영화 신세계 바라 재밋따
WHERE CAN I BUY HA-JOON'S RED SWEATER
my man jimmy is unbelievably drunk, get him a ginger ale STAT
They all look like models
Jimmy Fallon is hella fake but I'm glad this show is getting international attention.
Love Squid Game...Jimmy Fallon over acting as a host...not so much.
This is the first time kdrama literally broke all the records of popularity, not only in kdrama world, but everywhere. Proud of em :D
Get Ali on the show!
Omg I am so obsessed with this show!
omg the actors are so fine
So happy Jimmy Fallon got to interview the cast of Squid Game 😁! I really enjoyed Squid Game 👍🏽. Love you Jimmy Fallon 🤗. Be blessed everyone 💜💜💜💜
3:22 racist much Jimmy? Do better.
I actually simp for ji hun when I first saw the show
We literally used to play that game in our childhood
I love how happy jimmy is talking to them …and the cast is really attractive
Great series, amazing cast!  Lee Jung-jae is sooooo cute!
Happy to see more kdrama/movie/show get recognition. They are truly amazing. Full of famous stars!!! Jung Jae, Lee Byung Hun, GongYoo etc. Jung Jae is a legend! When Jimmy said he played all evil characters I was quite surprised, He started out as a heartthrob in the 90's and with all nice characters. This role us def diff than his previous roles. He also lives a very quite life. 👏 to the director/writer/creator he truly a genius for writing this 10 yrs ago. I wish he was at the interview. This whole show they able to pack suspend, emotion, full of lessons. So happy I binge while working yesterday ❤
i’m so in love with jung hoyeon, she’s gorgeous😍✨
HE BECAME A DAD OMGG—
4:52 this fuckin jimmy fallon
kpop idols are more popular compared to k actors but i feel like kpop is such an overrated concept of having a bunch of good looking and young people dancing and singing to same kind of music but the real essence lies in korean movie industry or drama industry，i came to know abt kpop through kdramas
Where is Ali... THE BEST CHARACTER IN WHOLE SERIES WITH PURE HEART
Jimmy fake laughing is a trend now
"No spoilers!!! I'm not giving away any spoilers" This was after he gave away a huge Red Light/Green Light spoiler. I'm glad I saw this after I watched the show, otherwise, I would have kicked Fallon's ass for spoiling as much as he did.  "I WILL END YOU!" - Barry Gibb
I just came here to see Sae-byeok alive 😭😅
Language 😲
5:47 Jimmy acted super akward with his fake enthusiasm
Why is the actor playing Ali never in these interviews?
Wait wait wait how they speak English i thought they speak Korean!!!
Man, Fallon is just terrible
This is a real Korean squid game https://youtu.be/2kWfWo8_7vA
This show made the squid 🦑 animal famous. I didn’t know before today
Squid game is everywhere
The Subtitles went fast for me sometimes but I still LOVED it cant wait for the next season
lmao jimmy is sooo tryhard
Jimmy Fallon is so fucking fake
Where is Ali?🙂
WI Ha Joon 👀👀👀
Where is Seong bro 😒
he didnt ask her any questions :(
4:50 I almost believed this laugh
where is Ali
Кто РУССКИЙ?
such a awkward ass interview
알고리즘 무엇 ㅋㅋ
This show had amazing acting. The fear of getting killed was palpable. Only thing I couldn't stand was the script for the American actors that were gambling... So cheesey and lame.
He told that he won't spoil anything until they know   Jimmy :  >>> showed the episode 1 ( almost end part ) of the 1st game >>>         Those who haven't seen it yet :               ?  ? ?  ? ? ? (●__●) ? ? ?
Based on this interview and questions you can just tell that the message of the show flew right over Jimmy Fallon's empty corporate head.
나도 재미있게 봤지만, 지미 팰런쇼도 나오고 완전 대박이네ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 외국애들은 어릴때 뭘하고 논거니?
Netflix changing the way we used to watch movies, series and documentaries
Imma be honest i had no intention of watching this show, not bc i had anything against it or anything but just bc i dont really watch too many tv shows. But i was at my cousins house and he offered to have us watch it so of course i accept the offer. We got thru the first 3 episodes, then it was time for me to go home, and when i got home around midnight, u bet i stayed my ass up till 6am to watch the other 6 episodes. This show was fantastic. Cant wait for season 2.
Baby squid is the cutest nickname ever
Wow when did Jimmy Fallon become so awkward?
She cute😩✋🏻
Why didn't he ask HoYeon any questions?
Where is ali
Mag Truth Bitter was right about this show
Cant believe the actually talk Inglish
i literally can't stand jimmy fallon
Wi Ha-joon is so gorgeous. I'm loving Squid Game. It's a much larger story than it seems. It speaks for all of us. Genius!
I was so pissed that Detective Jun-Ho did all that just to get shot by his brother. He did all that for NOTHING. lol i was pissed.
There is nothing to surprise at the Squid Game if you watch Japanese movie and anime before,  A lot of plots from Squid Game plagiarize from them
the part when ail saves gi hun from death is so cute!
it’s about time that Kdramas and Kmovies are getting recognized in US especially in Hollywood.. that’s what’s up
Ok maybe I'll go watch it. Because of the clip. Seeying one of the players saving the other one. Lumb in my throat ❤
Squid game blew up like-
Jimmy Fallon is pathetic. He's actually everything but funny.
if watched squid game for the 6th time im obbsed with it
아니 지미팰런쇼에 스크린과함께 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ멋지다멋져 ♥
Btw… jimmy says he’s not giving away any spoilers after giving away one
I know it's very mean but it would be hilarious if he mentioned the VIP to the police actor. "What do you think of Americans after that scene?" That would get all the audience to LOL.
3:44 thanks God for create a gorgeous girl😍
Jungjae is also currently dating the ex-wife of the CEO of Samsung
Can you believe how Korean language mini series has become worldwide 🌐 number one  because of internet.  I'm glad world knows Korea not just for popular Psy Gangnam style or BTS, now  mini series also.  I hope Korean food will become popular daily eats in worldwide.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
jimmy kimmel is boring as shit
What a great show - worth a watch 100%.
Love them 😭💜💜💜
Oops  Love kdramas. Writers are super creative and the dramas be so touching and very heart warming. I recommend for the actions fans: The man from no where (Movie) Bad Guys(drama) Vincenzo (drama) City Hunter(drama) Suspicious partner(drama) The healer (drama) So many many more than these.  Fluffy ones are: Boys over flower Masters sun (kinda scary see ghosts) Good doctor(medical, our drama is based on theirs) My girlfriends a  Gu mi ho Secret garden(like freaky friday) Heal me kill me It’s ok that’s love(heavy topic but beautifully done) So many many more.
That box reminds me of the monument game for iOS
Where is Ali?
Great,Job Netflix 👍
*THEIR STYLISTS UNDERSTOOD THE ASSIGNMENT 100%*
I wish he would have had Ali as a guest. My heart went out for him in the movie.
It would have been better if Conan interviewed them instead
Wow I fell i  love with Korean series. Everybody must watch squid game. Seriously amazing 😎
Jimmy Fallon is so fake and robotic...... He should have auditioned for the role of one of the VIPs....
Where is Ali 😭
진짜 내가 신세계랑 암살이랑 관상에서 연기하는 이정재만 보고 이런 토크하는 프로는 별로 보질 않았는데 뭔가 캐릭터마다 보여주던 거친 날것의 이미지 없이 반듯한 꽃중년 아저씨가 계시네.
4:53 jimmy faking his laugh is so apparent
Fallon is a fake prick! Total cringe! Squid Game is amazing and these four were amazing. I like the cop, he's sooo cute :-)
Beautiful people
my heart dropped when the girl spoke, she is so pretty
How do they not speak English. But listen to the question in English then answer in Korean
Raise ur hands if u have not seen a single ep of Squid game but still watching the interview.
this is lit
There is something immoral about rich actors playing these desperate, penniless characters in a pseudo-socialistic series made by huge corporation Netflix
Park Hae Soo is such a great actor. You guys should watch "Prison Playbook" , "Persona" & many others to find out.
Jung-jae Lee is literally a legend in Korea. He is one of the most charismatic and sexiest actors in his ages. Gong Yoo, the salesman in the first episode is a top A list star aswell. Arguably everybody likes them!
Good
Am i the only one who is mad that ali isn’t here
😀😀
Kd a lee yoo-mi?????????!????
Tudo perfeito e maravilhosos---------
Squid game is refreshingly different to anything else on TV!
Ooooooooooooooooooo
There is real life squid games in north korea if you disrespect the leader.
1:40  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA lmao
4:51 lol
is there really a live audience or is it just a recorded claps-
Mom-what are you doing son? Me-4:49
WHERE IS ALIIII?🥺
SARANGHAE ❤K-DRAMA, K-MOVIE
i hate jimmy fallon
I wanna watch squid game but I don't have netflix 😭😭😭 please someone give me any link for watching squid game please please please 😭😭😭
I love Hoyeons When she was speaking in English it sounded really pretty
I really like  Ali and SAE BYEOK ❤️🔥🔥
I'm not Korean but I am East Asian, and I used to be bullied in school because of my facial features and my culture, so it makes me beyond happy to see that the world is now appreciating Korean talent, and also expanding their interests towards East Asian media in general <3
드라마로 미국 토크쇼 진출!!! 대박사건
So glad I clicked to watch- super intriguing and refreshing to get a take into another cultures preview regarding C.R.E.A.M! 🦑
Love Squid Game and the cast 😍🤗
Yeah, where's Ali here?
Where is anupam Tripathi
i can tell that jimmy was really nervous
I'm a Filipina and a fan of squid games artists
South Korean wave still going strong.
Kalimutan ko ship ko HAHAHHAHSHASHA AYIE
Sae-byeok is actually has a very well developed modeling career, Squid game will only 10x her career. She is about to be a top international model, making more than the rest of this cast combined. She's an absolute knock out.
can we talk about how jimmy like didnt have any questions nor like compliments to jung ho-yeon, talk about rude!
It’s Jimmy’s forced laugh at 4:52 for meee 😂😂😂 you gotta love him 😂🧡
Why does jimmy give Caesar flickerman vibes in this interview??
I played red light green light in primary school and completely forgot about it until I watched the show. I was terrible because I could never stay still.
무궁화 꽃이 피었습니다❣
Oh kay jimmy whatever but this was sooo cuuuuuute score for the baddie who was the only one who spoke English
The jagged thrill enzymatically memorise because drop biomechanically harass plus a impolite dry. cuddly, green grey grieving apparatus
The Neon Square: Baby I'm Not Even Here I'm Just a Hallucination
We indians should learn from them they are not ashamed of speaking their native language...I know they don't know english but still.
I am so happy for South Korea breaking the barriers in Hollywood thru film, music, and media!
Deok-su, wheres my boi? Also.. everything suronding squid game. Writing, cast and so on. Amazing. Simple amazing!
•^^
Idk but "jiguem right now" reminds me of Jay from Enhypen
people recently protesting Asian violence last month, this month Asians being slaughtered in the number one show ever. Huh???? You "Wokes" are confusing.
he literally ignored the girl
Alguien que lo traduzca pronto porfis
Like 2 minutes in Jimmy did not know what he said.. he just heard the audience so he clapped and was like “that’s my man! That’s what I’m talking about” 😂👀 couldn’t hide it
I thought the cop spoke English with the vip.  Was that adlip
Oscar for best film, now squid game, just fantastic. I became a fan of Korean cinema with "Old Boy"
i can't stop thinking (why Jimmy didn't ask Jung Hoyeon like her male partners) !! what the hell Jimmy!!?
Jimmy must have been dying inside by pronouncing their names
She’s sooooo beautiful
So 70 years you Americans were bombing Korea but now that a hit Korean show brought in tons of cash to your all American Netflix platform you’re selling your soul for an interview with the protagonists?  Is there anything that money can’t do in this century?
The cast are incredible but why does Jimmy seem so incredibly awkward and unnatural in this interview
Korea took a big W
I only watched and tolerated this video for the cast for squid game because they are so adorable and lovely but god jimmy is unbearable to watch as an interviewer.
4:51 that laugh sounds so natural, well done, Jimmy!
Uhm, Jimmy?? No spoilers really? After talking about the giant doll and the fact that she shoots everyone who plays Red Light, Green Light? But ... okay ... no spoilers ROTFL! (Love you anyway, Jimmy! REALLY glad I didn't see this before I watched the show, though!)
gi hun is so handsome i cant-
Um. No spoilers and then they take away one of the most nerve wracking moments in RLGL lol
YES
I grew up with Koreans. They’re lovely people
The doll is cute, what's the big deal?  Its not the doll that's bad it's the people.
Jimmy was talking a lot 😭
Where is anupam tripathi aka ali abdul.
The robot look like Mai from my  neighbor Totoro
Where is Ali?
I love them
I wish the old man was invited he was an amazing actor!
Im just glad to see them all well and alive together lol
Jimmy speaking and fake laughing is so cringy, he used to be more sincere before but now you just see so clearly how he's faking it and not really meaning what he's saying... It's just so uncomfortable to watch, Gosh
Ali's death made me sad.
Verdade
God I hate Jimmy Fallon
NETFLIX FLEXING 💪 OVER DISNEY RIGHT NOW
Love this show
Oh that's actually maybe the best clip from the entire show! One of the most artistic inspired moments! Even wondering should they even play such a beauty! :)
a lot of people dont know what kind of actor lee jung jae is. YOU GUYS SHOULD ALL WATCH DELIVER US FROM EVIL. HE IS GANGSTA AS FUCK IN THAT
Surprisingly we used to play similar games in China when I grew up.
okay just a heads up for viewers, if you haven’t seen squid game, the clip they show here is a major spoiler, particularly to for the initial mood setting.
I don't understand shit
Русские вы тут
R we gonna ignore what the old man said, life outside is worst than inside!!
“ no spoilers “   ** a full scene comes up 2 mins later **
Jung Ho Yeon IS JUST SO BEAUTIFUL!!!😍
Am proud of my country 🇰🇷 배우들한테 이상한 질문 안해줘서 고맙대ㅋㅋㅋ 이 영상만큼은 국뽕에 취한다 크~
LOOOVE THE SERIES FFFFFF YA , soo all my friends in school , was intense, sooo motional & BLOODY asf  LOOOVED it, well done   , i am NOT into Asian guys , BUT that cop in RED sweater there sitting & subway dude in Bart station  both really  CUTE 🥰😜
k-pop: BTS k-movie: Parasite k-drama: Squid game
Can they all drop their skincare routine? gamsa haeyo
BOOM
Very beautiful persons!
I love this cast so much!!! So humble and nice! Such a big difference from Western artist full of themselves. And I am not Asian, actually I am English!
Hoyeon my favourite yours
Fun Fact: Player 456 Is The Number Of Gi-Hun. The Money Is To. '45.6 Billion' (I Will Edit This Comment If It Has Likes.)
It was time that others Countries take their place in tv!!
I can almost relate to how the show attracted very different views. It looks like my native town's guys were far detached from the rest of the world. HK audience likes to pick a lot of "bugs" in the show like they would scrutinize Doraemon stories full of logical flaws and errors/anachronisms and so on. I think Jung most likely DOES have a lot of role in the show, but she has mixed reviews among HK viewers, and for very cultural reasons Lee (the other character) gets far more attention in hk than among other viewers.  My fair judgment is the show sells really well, and the mainstream viewers don't actually care about the countless "logical flaws" you could pick. Those flaws, you know, are likely "how is this guy not dead", "this is impossible to do in real life", "it defies logic/gravity", and so on. I also think international viewers are far less likely to pick on Gihun's flaws, although we know we all have many, and serious, flaws.
Damn sae byeoks english
K but where's Ali???
The whole convo sounded awkward to me 😀
how did they understand what they were saying in real time there aren’t subtitles
This show is evil. I think this show have to be cancelled. Just violence
Love the cast they did a awesome job
I refuse to watch and I like the parts where I don't understand,  but they forgot the X on the table for this Playstation interview
What a pasty grouping.  Like seriously greenish body glow
jimmy fallon was tripping balls in this interview
Jimmy : That dolls eyes are cameras. People who move get shot!  Also Jimmy : I won't give any of the spoilers for today
Sehr gut Serien
First guy looks like Jet Li
Jimmy fallon with the fake laugh… cringe
But why do I feel like this is an infiltration?
The movie was epic.
wow..this is because Netflix..great job..
Jimmy might as well learn korean lol. The way korean entertainment is getting famous he'll be ahead of his game that way xD
“하나님이 세상을 이처럼 사랑하사 독생자를 주셨으니 이는 저를 믿는 자마다 멸망치 않고 영생을 얻게 하려 하심이니라 하나님이 그 아들을 세상에 보내신 것은 세상을 심판하려 하심이 아니요 저로 말미암아 세상이 구원을 받게하려 하심이라 저를 믿는 자는 심판을 받지 아니하는 것이요 믿지 아니하는 자는 하나님의 독생자의 이름을 믿지 아니하므로 벌써 심판을 받은 것이니라” ‭‭요한복음‬ ‭3:16-18‬ ‭
Ok Jimmy was wasted as hell, he didn’t make sense during the whole thing… well he doesn’t make sense anyhow!
Jimmy’s being faker than usual huh?
I love this cast so much :DD
What a genuinely heartwarming interview! My 9-12 yr old grandchildren told me about SquidGame and me being already  Kdrama smitten - well, I was happy until I was so horrified I forbade them from watching…but they didn’t abide by my ruling and we all ended up watching every episode! (They covered their eyes for the raunchy sex scene) It became a topic of great discussions among us and I am impressed with the insights they garnered from watching this show. The conflict of human ethics and character development (not to mention the ironies of humour and pathos so deftly portrayed by the settings, script and improv of the actors in the story became the highlights of each episode, and I must say this only confirmed for me that if anyone can deliver a poignant heart-softening and enlightening human experience to our largely desensitized western civilized humanity, it’s the ‘artful Koreans!
As a Korean, watching korean actors&singers&idols who weren’t very known in other countries but being loved all over the world now makes me so happy and proud 💖💖 I also love how much our traditional games became famous by squid game. especially dallgona game! <3
4:51 god that was a fake laugh
I didn't see the interview because I wanted to complete the series and now I'm watching this interview
Bigger than what jimmy ??🤭
Jimmy has the worst laugh
크~
Spoilers
IMO, this interview would have been 10x better if they had the old man (oh il nam) with them.
loved the show! they are all great actors
How come Kang died??????? Ji sacrificed herself for her
the interviews great but only the actor of Ali is missing…
Garbage
Interesting fact: You get to participate in the Squid Game irl if you get the free complimentary vaxxines, the 2nd one is the ticket for entry, effective immediately 😊😊😊
I'm so happy kdramas are finally getting noticed this is an amazing show and cast
Love from india 🤍🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
3:56 i love how she said that 🥺🥺
He didn't ask the one guy any questions. That is rude.
The full cast is so attractive
They are all incredibly attractive people !!
4:51 omg that's the fakest laughter I've ever heard... Got goosebumps
Needed Ali
No spoilers lol? What
Love from india 🇮🇳
This show is the best thing to happen to us
Does anyone who are interested in Lee jung jae, please you should watch 'New world'. It's movie and really amazing to watch his acting.
what a show man....it was awesome series. great job guys
Repent of all your sins to ALMIGHTY JESUS CHRIST
How can you understand language because Jimmy Fallon understands the language
Jimmy's fake enthusiasm is getting really old and dull now. The #1 reason I don't watch his show anymore. Squid Game though, I'll definitely watch that.
I LOVE THIS but why is Ali not included thooo :((
One is a boy and one is a grrrrrr
YESSSSSSSS
Ali 🤨??
Jimmy’s fake laugh never gets old
Baby Squid. haha, how adorable
4:58 "No spoilers" He literally gave away the first game...      Also that was the fakest laugh I have ever heard from Jimmy
owowwowow
This was a WONDERFUL interview! What a great cast!😃🦑🎮⏹⏺🔼
I’m glad the world is coming together more sharing their cinema and others appreciating it 🤗
Should’ve had them live
Number 1 in Brazil yahooooo!!!
God jimmy fallon is so obnoxious and embarrassing he needs to lay off the booze
what is jimmy on
Jesus is coming soon!
I uploaded a picture of lee jung jae's childhood on my YouTube.. He is so handsome.
great interview but jimmy's fake laugh is too much, ughh
CHIGEUM RIGHT NOW
it was awsomely executed, but its kind a copy of Japanese anime series and film "Kaiji: The Ultimate Gambler".
THE MUSIC OF THE CLIP HAS ME DYING RN
Why did he not ask the girl one question?
Terrible hosting by this Jimmy Fallon...
I love 💕 the cast, but WTF is wrong with Jimmy ?! It's painful to watch 😖
Why is Ali so underrated?
Это как с сериалом про Чернобыль. Погудят еще месяц и все) Но сериал мне понравился)
Can't get enough of themspecifically jung Ho Yeon,hopefully she plays a character in the KoreanMoney Heist probably as AllisonParker, Stockholm or Manila..
bro they are so cute
Man i love them all so gaddamn much
Pfvr o Sang woo (?¿) é muito gato q raiva
Thanks for having them on the show, and doing your best with the interviews Jimmy Fallon.
Hey Jimmy, you know what would be funny.. if you and Horacio took that Red Light, Green Light doll to an SNL after party.
This is One of the best shows!!
Jimmy : No spoilers! Also Jimmy : Here are some spoilers
bro it feels so awkward xD
Jimmy needs to cut out the fake laughing, it makes everything awkward. It doesn't always have to be laugh out loud funny, why can't it be a casual, pleasant sit-down chat with guests with some witty comments thrown in every now and then
I love them so much!!! I really liked the serie it was so emotional 😍❤️😭
BABY SQUOD
Should I watch this show? And if so, subbed or dubbed?
Jimmy Fallon is totally cringe, everything he says and projects looks so forced, no wonder Gutfeld kicks ass! The Squid Game is definitely worth to watch though....
Jimmy seems to talk in a kind of anxious way, doesn't he? Blurting things out and so over enthusiastic that it doesn't seem natural anymore. Or perhaps it's just me not being used to him and American television 🙂
I think Squid Game is Korean version of "Who wants to be a Millionaire". 😂😅
Too bad this was with Jimmy Fallon. Fake laughs make me cringe. He's misplaced as a talk show host. Conan _went_ to South Korea, for goodness' sake. We needed him at this moment more than ever. Can you imagine how much better that would have been?
Where is Ali Abdul ???
Be sure to get your kids that sick toy for Christmas
No one talking about that jung ho yeon speaks english, very well🚬
They should have had Anupam there as well as he was one of the main characters and he speaks English - which would have been great dynamic for the interview.
How are they talking to eachother ?
I personally feel that squid game is a bit overrated, don't get me wrong I watched the show and thought it was really good, but people hyped it up to be way bigger than it actually is
C.O.F.F.E.E, anyone?   C.O.F.F.E.E  means CHRIST OFFERS FORGIVENESS FOR EVERYONE EVERYWHERE  Please take a few minutes of your day to finish reading this important notes.  Read it as if it's your life, thank you. Just for a few minutes please.  You need oxygen to live. But you don't see the oxygen with our own eyes right? You have to cooperate by breathing the oxygen to live.   God is also like an oxygen, we don't see Him, but we need Him. I'll tell you later on why we need Him, just continue reading...   Maybe you already have heard the Gospel of Christ, but you might have not heard the "true" (not sugar-coated or watered down) gospel of Christ. So, let me tell you.  We have to cooperate with Him by breathing His words,meaning, we have to fit in to His words and live in His ways.   Many of us see the Bible full of rules and do's and don'ts. Then, we intend to think we like our ways better. We want freedom,  fun, and hapinnes, pleasures, etc. right? "no kill joy", we say.   God gave us free will and most of us wants to rule our own life. We seem to think what's best for us more than our Creator do?    But our ways will only lead us to emptiness, regrets, chaos, brokenness, dissatisfaction, death and will lead us to dark places in our lives.   God's ways and commands on the other hand, leads to abundance of life (not materialism), peace, real joy, eternal life, and "for our own good" for His glory.   As you get along to a journey with Him, you will get to see His worth, goodness, and who He really is and who you are in Him. You will get to see what He has in store for you.   God created us fearfully and wonderfully. We are created in His image. Sin separated us from our Creator who can only heal, satisfy us, and make us complete. We are all broken inside and we are all wicked.  “'For I know the plans I have for you,' declares the Lord, 'plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future. '” — Jeremiah 29:11  Don't you see? many people are dying everyday all over the world. We are in a stranger times. Sin is now normal, we are never going back to normal, look at the world,  "what do you think happens after you die?"  Believe it or not, there's an afterlife.  Our life here is very temporary "Life is short", this is true. We only live once. There's no such thing as reincarnation and purgatory.  So why waste our time enjoying sins or living our life in our own ways or plans when God created us with a wonderful purpose.   There are only two eternities that exist. Heaven and Hell. Where do you think you will go?  But you know what? God can turn our disobedience to obedience. Jesus is able to free us from slavery of sins. He can get rid your stony heart.  ROMANS 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.  Sin separated us from God and we are all deserving to go to hell for eternity.   God is love but God is also a righteous judge, and  Judgement day is real and is coming so soon! This is worse than the BIG ONE their saying.  R O M A N S  3 : 2 3 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,  Good works, going to Church, serving, morals, men, religion, ethics, man made gods, Mary or anything/anyone won't be able to save us and we can't save ourselves.  But Jesus is the only way to salvation and reconciliation to God.  JOHN 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.  JOHN 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father (God) except through Me.  Christ Died for Our Sins That We Might Die to Sin 1 Corinthians 15:1-3 Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,  Jesus was buried that we must be burried  Romans 6:3-4 Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.  Jesus rose again! the we might rise with Him. 1 Corinthians 15:4 and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, Romans 8:2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.   Admit that you have sinned against God and confess your sins to Him. Repent!  True repentance= must be sincere, change of mind, turning away from sisns, not just godly sorrow. It's not saying sorry but an action. It's the first step of basic foundation to salvation, without it you cannot be born again.  Romans 3:23  For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,  Acts 2:38 Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.  You must be born again! "Born this way" is a deception. Don't be fooled.  John 3:5 Jesus answered, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.  Water baptism is not for infants, if you are baptized as a baby, that doesn't count.  You must be baptized when you know how to decide already, when you know good and bad, evil and right.   MARK 16:17‭-‬18 And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.”  As you have responded to the gospel, continue to live a life as His disciple, loving God, and fulfilling the great comission.   As it is said in Mathhew 28:18-20 And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen.  Fight the good fight of faith, finish the race, and be blameless until Jesus return. Don't return to your old life. Keep turning away from wickedness.  Matthew 16:24 Then Jesus said to His disciples, “If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.  Remember, we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us. (Philippians 4:13)  Did you like the C.O.F.F.E.E of God? May God bless you!
That seen of Ali catching Seong who was about to trip and Sang-woo looking back at Seong so pensively across the finish line, was such a genius and defining scene for the show!!! Ali Abdul didn't get enough credit! ❤️
Jimmy Fallon is so unlikeable
Where is Ali ? :'( Why he isn't there ???
So many moments in this interview like Su and Sae-byeok speaking English and the beautiful Fly Me to the Moon song from Neon Genesis Evangelion playing when Ali saved Seong... I was jumping and Sooo happy to see that and their reaction!!! ❤️😍
Jesus loves you all! We have all gone against Him and deserve hell, but Jesus came down to die for your sins so you could be forgiven and so He can save you from hell and give you life forever with Him in Heaven. He offers this gift to everyone out of precious love! Accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and be saved! God bless!
No one's talking about Deok-Su .. He was hell of a character !
I didn't care about Squid Game as much as I cared about Seong Gi-Hun and the others sitting here...
American fans who speak Korean fluently listening to Bobby Fallon pronounce their names be like 🥴! 🤣
Jimmy ruined this interview for me, I couldn't properly enjoy it. He's such a dramatic attention seeking manchild.
Squid game is great but so are most Korean shows, I really don't think they get the attention they deserve   Hopefully this opens the gates for more Korean TV shows to be embraced by Western audiences
Great
Wow love them and the show! But really, imagine getting to interview Jung Hoyeon (someone who could have been asked a complex question in English) about her experience or take on this insane show and asking her THAT question?
Anupam Tripathi (Ali) Major missing
Ali?
"Red light, green light(빨간 빛, 초록 빛)!" is a liberal translation. The game is called "무궁화꽃이 피었습니다(The Rose of Sharon has blossomed)." in Korea.  The psycho robot '영희(Younghee)' also says it like that before looking back.
so sad they cut ali out of the clip )):
Han Mi Nyeo or # 212 is the most annoying and fingernail screeching character on Squid. I wanted to take her out so badly after the bathroom scene🤮
Where is Ali and Seong Ji
This jimmy guy ruins the joke with his fake laugh !! it's so irritating ..
Is the host drunk?
I absolutely love the cast they all seem like great people and they were all terrific in the show but I just cant stand how fake fallon is, I don't know if it's just the way he was on that day or if he's gotten worse but I'm finding it harder to watch him.
Season 2
Loved the soju and bulgogi while in South Korea.
I just watched Episode 6 ....... O-M-G this show, going to look more into Korean film etc. what a breath of fresh air
Jimmy's pronunciation in Korean calling their name was not bad at all! Great job!! 👍
is Jimmy drunk?
For some reason, something feels off in this vid, its either that Jimmy is nervous which I truly doubt, or there is something going on with him or backstage which is causing this weird, uneasy atmosphere. Did anyone notice? or is it just me
It's pretty awesome that the 4 actors are on the show in the US.
akala ko yung nakapula sa thumbnail si darren espalto
I know damn well it took him forever to learn how to pronounce those names
Thank you Jimmy, for not dubbing their replies. I think it's so important to keep the actors voices intact. they hold a lot of genuine reactions. thank you.
It took among us's crown and kept it
Why don’t they speak English? They must’ve learned some in school. This is 2021 and these people are still ignorant 🙄 I’m so frustrated
Korean is not an international language! These people don’t even speak English. They should have at least learned something simple before the interview. I can’t believe this 🙄
1:45 coooll
Oh you guys call it green light red light? In France it's 1 2 3 soleil (1 2 3 sun) But ye i didn't know that
I wouldn't consider the season perfect, but every character including basic side characters are amazing
Jimmy's fake laugh again
Man his fake laugh ruins my life!
어쩜 저렇게 재미없게 대답을 하냐
This show is effin amazing !!! Koreans are amazing !! Love them !! I just completed episode 2. ❤❤🥰🥰🤠🤠🤩🤩excited !!
Dear , also mention that  Sang Woo closed himself in a bathroom with a smoldering fireplace , and that will produce Carbon monoxide and its a poisonous gas . Gi-Hung always said that he was good in studies and Samg Woo used this knowledge to attempted suicide.  No one on YouTube mentioned it.
I'm damn sure that it took 15 minutes for Jimmy to learn their names
That girl should act in James bond movies.. She looks like a badass 😍
This show deserves its fame and attention and hype !!! I just completed Episode 2 !!! 🤩🤩🥰🥰🤠🤠 Really excited .
The language sounds beautiful
At first i was suprised that jung jae has a totally different acting role this time. He used to be a villain in korean movies. You guys should watch his previous famous movies. He is a good actor indeed.
Please next time invite ali too
decent show, acting is aight. language sounds horrible to my ears unfortunately:/
Finally kdrama getting there recognition i'm so happy
They’re all just such beautiful people 😍♥️ I want to see more films from them
Squid Game just got popular , there's more such movies/series korea has to offer which are some next level stuff
Wow!! Love this cast
Broke Pls Send Money to: Mark Edwards, Flat 7, Preston Court, Sanford Lane, Wareham, Dorset, BH20 4DX, UK. Please Share address everywhere 🙏🏻👍🏻🍺
Korea seems to send a global wave after gangnam style

Great journey by cast of
Aww I wish Ali could’ve been in the interview
Hoyeon speaks great English! I want more of her
Jimmy's fake laughter at 4:54 is so awkward to watch...
Squid game is so big now  i used to not know it then my sister told me about the doll then i was like huh? Then when i saw in yt ooh pretty interesting
hae soo is so cute irl wth
How can they understand each other?
It's so nice to see how respectful Jimmy was for being able to pronounce every actor's name properly. It's actually not that hard to pronounce a short single foreign word. All you need to do is to take a little bit of time and practice. However I've almost never met someone who can call my non-English name in a correct way when I was living in the States. Not only in personal situations but also in buisness meetings. So it was really imprrssive to see Jimmy's respectful attitude and passion as a interviewer! It seems like he'd put extra effort for his show and interviewees.
연기력으로 인정 받은 점이 진심으로 너무 자랑스러워요♡ 당신들과 같은 한국인이라 영광입니다 :)
I have never in my life scene an interview more like the synical ones from hunger games in my life 😀 very cringy
Hae soo is adorable he really went “jigeum right now!”
I swear I watched the series for Lee Jung-Jae.. big fan. But I enjoyed the series.
Omo omo
ZENIAU
them fake laughs damn
Wow talk about equality can't have them on one by one
Still can't get over Jimmy's fake laughs
자막이 필요해요
I feel bad for anybody who watched the whole thing in ONE sitting - watch one a day - it makes it much much more interesting! but then again most ppl are quarantined and have nothing to do so
Aaaaaah estaban muy nerviosos :')
Jung Jae's smile is so beautiful, his look irl is so damn attractive. He's like in my dad's age but i love him as a man lmao. Just.. look at him being so clean with the hair, without beard & moustache 💓
So cute all of them
Omg the show is so good I’m watching it the second time. 😁😁😁
Great show, everything was excellent about this show. I just couldn’t stop watching. Hands down the best show of 2021. Can’t wait for Season 2
i fucking hate talk show hosts like jimmy fallon but i loved squid game so this was cool to see
wooooow soooooo butefull
I see no-one fat in the show. All of em are fit
Im so dead when Hae Soo said "right now" 😂
*Corona Virus becomes world wide*  Americans: We hate Asians 😡  *Squid Game becomes world wide * Americans: We love Asians 😍
Bravo to them 👏
So that’s what their real voices sound like. Netflix, plz don’t dub them. We like subtitle options instead. Thank you
Cant wait for season 2. Amazing performances
Forever Ali!
Lets talk about how lee jung jae looks so handsome & charming. He's mature but he's so attractive. Even when he's younger he was so handsome, until now.
Please watch DP on Netflix. It’s the 2nd great movie I’ve ever seen ! 🤗
❤️❤️❤️🇦🇷
this interview definitely challenged Jimmy lol
Wow it must be cool to work with your siblings. Wait, they’re not related???
No one noticed there's a triangle and circle on the table but no square they must have lost the square
Ali had actually been invited for the interview. He was betrayed once again.
truly an amazing show, I have never been this excited for a tv series in a very long time
Should suppoort this Movie Project  https://youtube.com/watch?v=GG5a03R4NjA&feature=share
You lot saying a kdrama finally getting recognition ermm is it important for america to recognise other countries media the world doesn’t revolve around america
YYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSS!!!!!!!
jimmy fallon is shit he doesn't know how to address his guests...
Why does everyone like this show so much 🤣🤣🤣
Jimmy is such a weird people pleasing creep
Jimmy is such a people pleasing douche lol
The director of Squid Game said today ex-President Donald Trump is one of rich VIPs watching people who were killed in the Squid Game story.
I won't watch it anyway
Wtf is wrong with jimmy fallon he can’t open his mouth or sum 😂
Que  bonitos
Youtube is racist confirmed. They think the cast is from parasite.
Jung hoyeon was quite a find of the series. She was absolutely flawless in her acting and perhaps the only character in the series that you secretly wanted to live until the last episode merely because you want her to share maximum screen time. Too bad she could hardly get a chance to speak in the interview , I waited patiently to hear her out. She looked so beautiful here and spoke confidently, I would love to watch more of her as an actor on the world stage in years to come. More power to you Jung - you’re going to be at the top sooner or later.
How do the translations work in real time?
I can’t wait for the second season
I hate that when there's more guys than woman, they badly interview the woman.
I will never see stoplights the same way again
This has got to be the CRAZIEST PlayStation ad I have ever seen.
Jimmy you are AMAZING, thank you for this Squid game.  Wi ha you are handsome.
Yeahhhh ... amazing movie ' squidgame'
Jimmy's fake laugh makes me cringe
Okay why is Goon Yoo not in here? 😭😭😭
Hi😁
this was an awesome interview jimmy! thank you 😊
Nice actors and actress. Great show but wow can Jimmy Fallon become any more unbearable? His fake laughs and confusing responses to their answers is so cringe worthy. Why do americans keep these awful presenters relevant for years on end?
I’ve been into Korean entertainment almost a decade now and it’s great to see that people are realizing they’ve been SLEEPING on the Koreans for YEARS. Glad to see others appreciate their talent
Korean´s film makers are leading the industry these days! So talented. They made global stories to everybody.
1:30 it is bigger than What? GOT? la casa de papel? or what?
I definitely don’t have a crush on the chick
Why didn't invite ali .???? He deserved to be here
Hoyeon is so beautiful
굿 ~
Why were all the VIP's white..Why??
That scene played at the end of this vid I actually got chills from when I watched it for the first time. Something about the song and slo-mo..!
Police was doing nothing and also acting performance was bad No need
If you watched it, you might have nightmares or maybe see some bad effects
I loves this show I hope they make season 2 with other games man hunt, freeze tag, jump roping, egg hunting,
Wow love them 😍❤️
bad gurr
This drama is a COPYCAT of Japanese films LIAR GAME, KAIJI
This drama is a COPYCAT of Japanese films LIAR GAME, KAIJI
@4:49 could Jimmy have laughed any faker. He's so fake🤮 like bro I get that there's a language barrier but bro relax and try to genuinely connect with your guest I mean my gosh, if you can't connect with certain guest don't have them on your show just for clout and agendas. Jim Carey was so awesome to comedically expose him and the media❤
The squid game is so fabulous and disturbing at the same time..
I just watched the first episode of Squid Game today and was SO stressed out the entire time they were playing that first game!
He can understand korean?
I've watched it twice, it is made so well you can't stop watching.  Great work done and when you see them in real life, it truly shows they worked well together.  Great cast I say.
Outstanding cast 👏
Ali should have been there too.
I watched the Squid Game on Netflix, it was really awesome.
Good series liked it
Great
Fun fact: BLACKPINK Jennie's mother named her after Jung Jae ❤
Hoyeon looking gorgeous
If anyone jealous this successful series a d call this successful series overrated reply me. I will let you down 🤭😜
so happy to understand what they were saying without any subtitles🥰 proud to be a korean
Am I the only one want the VIP Il Nam to be interviewed please.. he's the real gamer!! 😁
4:48 that wasn’t awkward at all...
Where's Ali and II-Nam? :)
I just know he practiced saying the names 😭
Squid game shows how deeply we want to stop the 3% in the world. How we truly care about each other. And how most of us would never go to lengths of hurting each other just for money. Watch the show, even though brutal at times it has some great lessons to teach.
말이 필요없다 멋있다
Too bad season 2 different cast.
The gurrrrrr
영어 진짜 못한다…
The boy and the *gurr*
“Right now”😂✨
Imagine if Ali was there🥲
очень интересно,но ничего не понятно))
Lol
Wait, they're alive? What's he gonna do with the 45 billion?
My crush can speak engrish😭❤️
Where Ali :(
The most dangerous game in whole series was red light green light
I watched the first episode at like 9 pm and I couldn't go to sleep , I kept on thinking about what will happen next so I binged the entire show that night and I went to sleep at like 5 AM LOL
Where's Ali??
Ali is the best boy
They dint have to updo their hair just cos it's an English show.. they could be themselves too..
Mr Abdul deserved air time too lol
ali?
I was sooooo mad about Ali
He showed the most amazing scene haha love this.
Why don’t they call Ali ? He knows English as well so would have been nice to see him in this interview!
WHERE. IS. THE. ACTOR. WHO PLAYS ALI!!!!!!!!!!!
Watching the casts interviews is really helping me recover after watching squid game 🤧✋
Love the show and this cast!! They’re all amazing
I loved the show after I got used to the violence.  I cannot stop thinking about the messages about humanity
This guy says he’s giving no spoilers straight after he tells everyone there’s a doll that shoots you if you move
I watched the whole show in 2 days it was so addictive I couldn't put my phone down...
I’m still mad Ali was tricked and killed
เม้นไทยมีปะครับ #หน้ารักตลอดเลยนะครับจองโฮยอน🥰🥰🥰🥰
바로 지금!
I love to see how the cultural differences in this type of interview  and how we were able to manage it somehow idk just awesome
Jsksksks mequiero matar siempre paso por ese canal aaa pero nunca aparecen mis ídolos pero ahora cTm 😫🙌
I can't wait for the next season! Now they have to come harder  Some kids don't know about red light green light that's our childhood
'Baby Squid'. 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺❤❤❤❤❤
No spoilers?!?!… just glad I’ve already seen it.
The wailing, train to busan, oldboy, parasite, now squid game 😍
Where is our favourite ALI ???????
China is basically a big Squid Game.
Is there season 2?
Where is Ali?
WHERE IS 456?
well intro was a bit tongue twister
No le pudieron poner los subtítulos en español?😒🙄🤷🏻‍♂️
Jung Jae's smile is sooo cute 💜💜💜
This show is similar with a many series from japan that based on a game but this squid game they really know what people want,make it simple ,had an uniform that will be remembered and so on.
there's voices are soooo good 👍
Addicted
Great job Jimmy Fallon!!!
Alice in Borderland should of also got props from Jimmy Fallon show
Dalgona Challenge (spanish) https://youtu.be/E0Ac-cm51Pc
That was so sweet how he said he realizes the success now bc he meets Jimmy Fallon. Whether that was entirely true or not, it’s very sweet to say. What a lovely cast. And I can’t get over how beautiful the women are (I forget the name of the woman here and I don’t want to butcher it). I mean, I should have figured because they looked beautiful even all sweaty and dirty lol and I know this woman was a model originally but wow so beautiful. Not that that’s important but they’re all so kind and talented too! So it’s not fair 😂. Just kidding, at least they’ve shared their gifts (and good looks) with the rest of us to entertain.
They are so cool especially Haesoo
멋져부렁!!
My Comms professor always told us that violence is the most universally recognized theme in media, makes perfect sense that it’s #1 in 90 countries
A lot of asian shows & movies has always been a diamond, but what you know OSCAR🖕 or nothing, which is bullshit if I have to say.
whats more is that they have been working on the show for over 10 years! hard work pays off, yk what i mean?  the way squid game became trending in such a short time was amazing, ive never even seen something like that before in my entire life! and the way it out stands the other survival games because there are different stories, expression of feelings, secretive messages inside the show and everything else i cant possibly think of.  squid game is the #1 trending in the entire world.. and the most famous(?) clip is from sae-byeok and ji-yeon in episode 6! gganbu. the show is just outstanding, marvelous and other things.. i just love squid game because its so different from other survival series/shows! its actually amazing how many people actually wanted to act in the show even if they dont get any screentime.. thats just how popular squid game is.  squid game is just the most perfect series in short words.
Korean acting always making me bawled out in tears
3:45 was painful to watch again 😭 sorry to say even tho she’s cute
Why you didn’t invite ‘Ali ‘??
3 men on the panel, 1 woman. Some get asked more than one question but Jung Ho-yeon doesn't get asked anything. Her contribution is to expand on the creepy toy. She even speaks in more english than the others but barely any screen time. Come on now.
The whole season 1 is very good👍
Me like them getting gear see hater
Holy shit... I forgot people still watch television.
This still tells a lot about how America treats outseas Tv shows/Movies/Series , if it was a "so so" show in America , he would do a solo interview for each one of the actors, but since it is a very good show in Korea , let's just do an overall interview with them all the same time , because "who cares" right ?
mc아저씨 자막 있었으면 ㅠㅠ
Man i love them allllllll ♡♡♡♡♡
067 my wife knowing perfect English 🥲
Why there is no Anupam Tripathi ? He was the heart of squid game :-(
OMG! Seriously?
4:50 this was actually funny to hear but jimmy's fake laugh ruined it for me
The show is AMAZING and I love the cast. They're so nice and loveable.
The Indian guy is such a GOAT for saving  him in the first game
I swear, sometimes Jimmy is so cringy I can barely finish the video 😭
glad to see playstation getting notice
Sae Byeok English accent🤤
Where is gong yoo 💖😑
Squid Game 4k  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq7GwXC2nd0
It's an ok show, I wouldn't say it's great....
Can someone explain this movie?
Is it true what Jimmy said that Lee Jung jae played villain most of the times bcoz I cannot believe this.  He is so adorable in reel and real life,  like look at him he's so cute ☺☺
Jimmy acted like he understand what they say 😫🤣
is that the "hard to please" guy?
I'll be so proud of myself if I were them lol
baby squid got the same birthday as me
Loved the tug-of-war game and Il nam's commentary ...
I absolutely loved this gut wrenching amazing ride, so cleverly done, pure perfection, i actually cried because it ended lol.  Best show I've ever watched.

Let’s be honest. Fallon didn’t watch it
[Outrageous!  Korean media believe that Wu Kyung's "China" jacket copied the costume of the Korean drama "Game of Squid".  -Bilibili】   Pontang. There is a century-old puntang shop in Taiwan Province. It is called "Honeycomb Candy", "Deliyagu", and "Ginger Candy" in mainland China. They all do the same thing. Friends in Tianjin must not think that this is South Korea.  Tianjin’s "Dali Cake".  It was called "Camero" in Japan, and they are all the same thing, which originated from the court cakes of the Song Dynasty in China​  It is understood that Wu Jing wore this "Chinese" dress, which first appeared in the movie "Teacher Good" released in 2019.  At that time, Wu Jing played a guest role as a physical education teacher who always gave lessons to other teachers. The costume in the film was this dark green retro sports jacket with the word "China" printed on it.       In Wikipedia, it was originally written that pèng sugar originated from China, but after the pèng sugar cake game of "Squid Game" became popular, the introduction of Chinese origin was removed by the Koreans.。。。。。。。。。。。。

I feel like Jimmy is stuttering a lot speaking😂😂😂
This is very great to see😂😂😂
I thought Wi Ha-joon knows how to speak English T - T
Who else came here to see if Hoyeong Jung said she liked 'Thlasik Rim by Awmtea Polymer'
i am suddenly thinking of squidward
I wish Ali was also interviewed.
Korean culture came to stay, new era is coming
why they are so handsome:)
Best series
5:00
Koreans are Really Dominating with their Skills and Talent. Hats off to the writers and the whole cast for their amazing Performance in Squid Game
Jimmy's fake laugh is now becoming unbearable for me to listen !
I need 001, 101 and 199 to be in the show , it will be complete with them
Ho yeon cutie
where is storm shadow? hes not included?😅
국뽕이...차오른다ㅏ..💗
Where is our hero
why isn't ali and the old man there
Man why don't he talk to HoYeon Jung that much:(
lmao hae soo’s “jigeum right now” was so satisfying 😭
This is a disgusting premise. For this to be the world's #1 show, what is humanity coming to? Whether it's real someplace in the world or not, this is NOT a thing to be celebrated!
Where are the other 452 players?
We want Ali too !!
I like Jimmy Fallon. I liked this interview, but I noticed he didn’t talk to the women actresses to much. I know the interview wasn’t that long. Just i thought that was weird. Anyone else?
If you watch the scene of the collision between Lee Jung-jae and Jung Ho-yeon when she pick pockets him, you can tell she's laughing in the scene because it took Lee Jung-jae so many attempts to stick the straw back into the cup.
Forgot I couldn't stand Fallon fake laughs
That Jimmy fake laugh #cringe
Jimmy: "I am not giving any spoilers."       Same Jimmy: "She turns around, if you move, you get shot"
Sae byeok❤️👀love from Kerala❤️👀
your beloved actor wants to meet you, how do u react
How many more children's games can you ask the cast of Squid Game to play before someone finally snaps? 😠😡🤪
man, Jimmy has a hard time getting stuff out these days. What happened
Most of those games are played in other part of the world too
It's so wonderful seeing my gf, Hoyeong Jung on the tonight show  ( ◜‿◝ )♡
To be honest player 456 did move! lol 6:33
Great show. It’s amazing how Squid game showed human greed so well.
Fake laughs of Jimmy is scarier than the doll.
Where is Ali ?😢
Jimmy is a really bad actor, him talking to a video
Do they have Season 2?
His fake laugh reminds me of the hunger games interviews , and these are the contestants lol

I admire how they speak proudly in Korean. I'm from India, and here if a person cannot speak proper English they are considered unintelligent. The Bollywood actors in fact speak almost entirely in English using fake accents, ironically whilst working in the _Hindi_ film industry. Their kids apparently don't know how to speak in Hindi, despite growing up in Mumbai. Just watch this silly Netflix show called _The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives_ and you can see all this for yourself. I love how the top Korean celebs are proud of their culture 💜  Huge K-drama fan!!
No spoilers 😢☕
Imagine if some actor had been approached for this show and they rejected it - how they must be feeling after the show's success
Hoyeon Jung listens to Project Pat. That's all I need to know about how dope she is.
Where can I watch the full clip?
Jimmy: No Spoilers Also Jimmy 2 minutes earlier: The doll has cameras and if you move you get shot.
And now its also thr most viewed video in this channel
Anyone else thinks squid gane is too overhyped?
Can’t get enough of this cast. There is something refreshingly wholesome about them. Korea is really exporting some excellent culturally to the world and I am here for that.
this was definitely pre recorded
Asian series are such better than series from west
Good to see that they are talking in their own country language...If an Indian person went there he/her would feel shame to talk in Hindi
Beautiful people. Especially the woman - I learned she’s a model! Of course she is 🥰
I usually dislike Jimmy for his fake personality, but it's nice to see him interviewing people.
lmao i just lost it when jimmy said "wHo iS tHiS pHysCo rObOT"
RIP ALI he didn’t deserve that
That's so sad he didn't ask Hoyeon any question, she only talks once. :(
God can we just stop giving Fallon air time? He fake laughs at EVERYTHING in the most over-the-top way, it's sooo cringe.
Gotta love Jimmy. "No spoilers." And then he proceeds to tell you all about the Red Light, Green Light game and shows you one of the best moments in the entire series.
Jimmy is so fake it makes me cringe every time I see a clip from his show.
The cast and direction of squid game is amazing...... I haven't seen such direction in a long time.
I love squid game
Jimmy: No spoilers guys Also Jimmy: "Proceeds to show the scene of Ali saving Gi-hun from death"
Hae Soo's "right now" explains everything.
Others simping for wi ha jun me simping for the old grandpa smiling the whole show
i like Jung Ho-yeon with shorter hair like in the squid game more
What team is kind of scary
Where's Ali tho........
한국어 자막이 없는 게 아쉽다. 그리고 질문자가 좀 어색해ㅠㅠ
Abra una 2 temporada seria vacan algo entretenido
방탄소년단이 출연 할때마다 남준이 제외하고 영어 못하는 친구들은 한국어 인터뷰로 줄곧 했었어요, 그때도 역시 밑에 영어 자막이 달리고 한국어가사로 노래부를때도 이곳 지미팰런쇼는 영어 자막을 달아주곤 했었죠  물론 처음부터 그랬던건 아닙니다 , 시작은 힘들었지만 , 점점 한국문화의 힘으로 이렇게 바뀌어 가는구나 했습니다 ,역시 지미는 친절하고 배려심이 있는 안터뷰를 많이 해왔던 엠씨라서 든든해요 오징어 게임 더 흥하시길 , 지미팰런쇼 감사합니다
JESUS LOVES YALL 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖
this show is truly amazing and so heartbreaking but heartwarming at the same time and I’m so proud of them:)
This has to be the most awkward interview ever
Ho yeon laughs like a dork
I never prioritize shows. I’ve got so little time I can’t even get the time to watch the shows I really want to watch. Squid Game was not in my radar. Took a chance late at night after my wife went to bed, and watched ep 1. Then I binge watched it like my life depended on it. This show is pure magic. Even the tragic/evil characters are deeply loved and as important as the heroes. I’m so happy for Korean actors, filmmakers and writers to continue knocking it out of the park (Old Boy, Parasite, Train to Busan etc). Just please Hollywood, DO NOT remake this with Paul Rudd and Natasha Lyonne. Leave it be.   Embrace cultural diversity!
I remember when people made fun of me for being Asian and now we are taking over and the same people who made fun of me for being Asian are now trying to be Asian
This is my first time watching Jimmy Fallon. Is he always this bad of a host?
Gotta admit Squid game compete up to Stranger Things , Peaky Blinders. 🔥

I was thinking that people are too much with this movie, like was that really that good???  i tried to watched it last night and just finished all the episodes, damn this movie is really good, i mean i laugh, thrilled, scared, and cried, like lol, now i see ....
Jimmy Fallon and his fakeness at its best.
Amazing! https://youtu.be/V7xT1yNquAs
Youtube telling me this is from Parasite.
Korean movies, series and music are famous all over the world because it’s great. Also, many people loves the actors and actresses, they idolozes their beauty. In the philippines, korean tv series, movies and music have always been popular and well liked. Now, because if netflix and social media, it became more known to other countries, especially the new generation.
What kind of suit is lee wearing? Very unique
OMG
Where is Ali ?
This cast, literally everyone from the main charaters to the smallest supporting role were just so fantastic. I was so impressed with the acting on this show.
Funfact Americans the main actor has been in romantic relationship for years with divorcee of Samsung ( the galaxy phones)

Was this really pre recorded...

About squid games, says is parasite
Jimmy is such a jackass. His fake laugh is so obvious and annoying. Who let this guy have a show for so long
I think it’s super awesome that this is the number one show in the world on Netflix because that is such a huge win for Korean Culture. It’s actually really cool to see something Korean that’s not K-Pop related for a change. Not hating on K-Pop because I’m a huge fan of it I’m just saying that it’s an awesome achievement.
Hoyeong's accent 🥺❤️
Squid games
Korean Zendaya is my New princess
Bro at my school I just hear everyone and see everyone playing and talking about squid game
BOI SANG-WOO IS NOT I GENTLEMAN EVERYBODY IS SITTING WITH THERE LEGS CROSS BUT SANG-WOO IS SITTING NORMAL. I bet he's gay
Yuhhh
It’s player 456
Korean entertainment hits differently for sure.
They’re so genuine and it really contrasts with Jimmy’s insincere and over-the-top persona. I’m tired of these big late night hosts acting so in awe of entertainment and missing the whole point. This show grew so quickly because it ridicules GREED and VANITY. It was beautiful. Why can’t Jimmy have a real conversation of depth?
Why is jimmy falling apart during this interview
jimmy kimmel’s fake laugh is so annoying
I LOVEEE THE ACTORS SO MUCHHH
I'm so proud of my fellow Americans for not being afraid of subtitles.
What a great show. They deserve the acknowledgement
Sorry. Another uplifting show to watch of human nature. Just what we need. What country does this originate?
I loved all of them
sae byeok is my crush no capp😍😩
Jimmy saying „I‘m not giving any spoilers“ and then continue giving spoilers😂😂😂
where is ali? fking racists
Wow he could memorize their names
Can someone tell jimmy to tone down the fake laughter and stop hitting the table? It’s so awkward and it looks so uncomfortable.
I love how he put “last names” first to be proper ❤️
How are they all SO BEAUTIFUL!?
the squid game is similar to human slave and sex traffic, but the trush is no one gonna pay you in the end and u all die.
JIMMY EXAGGERATING  LIKE  ALWAYS
Jimmy… I’m disappointed
jimmy confidently butchering the korean names 😭💀
Jimmy fallon is so enthusiastic I like how he interacts with his guests
Five years ago I fell in love with Kdrama and wondered how long it would take until it became a global phenomenon. It feels cool living in the future now.
WHERE IS ALI?
I haven’t watched squid game but I think it’s some kind of mr. Beast challenge but losers die
5:46 is the cringiest thing I've ever seen
the fact that they can’t speak english very well makes it SOOO many times better
No entendí ni mergas pero me gustó la entrevista XD
Very intense to watch yet you can't stop watching and can't wait to find out what's next!! My sons started watching it but soon I joined the suspense... really intriguing series!
Squid games is different sort of like Game of Thrones.. you never expect things to happen which make it special
Jimmy is Spoiler
Maybe get Ali in as he could be a story of how he got d role n his acting was great!
who no ali
Why didn't he not ask the girl any questions and why is Jimmy so cringy.
Where is alliiiii???
Love this show..love from Pakistan
4:52 what a fake laugh lol
Jimmy sh*** ARMY hates you
Who are here only for kang sae byeok  😂😂😂
Love squid game!
We love you guys!!!
the best series in the world!!! ❤️🇧🇷
Lol
How did the do the instant translations?
Ali deserved better 🤐🤐🤐
overhyped shit by media
People who care about “spoilers” are so annoying like of course you’re gonna hear about it it’s never the same as watching it
God i fucking hate jimmy fallon
Totally gave up so many spoilers ... Did he even watch it ??  And yeah he totally ignored the female actress.
Still don't know why tf this overrated ass show is so famous.
Oooh so they are not dead...
4:53 BYEEE THIS WAS SO UNCOMFORTABLE TO WATCH
이정재 마이컷다...웅장해지다
I can’t believe that Squid Game is the #1 show on Netflix!!! This is totally insane 😍
This talkshow and that dumbface jammy fillon need to lose their status asap
How does the people in audience or how does jimmy understand them? Because when you look at the tv there is no subtitles.
Love it
5:14
I knew Gi-hun would win but totally wasn't expecting old man to be the mastermind and for the detective's brother to be the front man!
이정재는 대한민국에서 인기많은 유명한 미남배우 이다
Well atleast the main protagonist won the squid game...so I am happy...feel sad for Ali though and the female sitting here.
Who knew the old guy was one of the owner of squid game.
Why is she so beautiful
Where’s Ali 😢
wow
but why not in the studio??
I think Jimmy has social anxiety
Where's the Indian/Pakistani dude? He was the biggest superstar in my eyes. He was done really dirty and I was pissed a fuck.
Love you all........🥰❤🤗😘
Hey I'm going back to sleep
Definitely Korea is so 'In'
"One is the boy.. and one is the gurrrr" AAAAAAAAA.. MY HEART.. I CAN'T.. 🥺😤😍😳😩
One question, where is Ali?😕
♥️♥️♥️♥️
I don’t think jung jae did that many negative roles. Nah
https://youtu.be/lLW_G2yaXgI
Player 456 won
O My God 81 lakh in 4 days? 🤪
Ali fan❤❤❤😔
Ali
Fun fact: skittle is here
Imagin Ellen intervening them, she would have made fun of their Names and language! But jimmy is very respectful, as he should
Ali is forgotten :((
Yes no one can forget Ali
Where is the Indian guy
1:27 he was about to say it’s bigger then stranger things but then remembered he needs them on the show after Szn 4
you’re not on the jimmy fallon show unless jimmy fallon just starts laughing out of now where while you’re just there smiling 4:53
What was that laugh at 4:53 painful to watch

이왜진?? why this is the truth?
“ i want to meet Jimmy Butler “ this guy is in the wrong game
Doesn't the plot seems pretty similar to the escape room?
Is it the complete show ???
Anyone know where I can get that black and red sweater? It's gorgeous
not hatin or anything, but I feel like Jimmy was a bit fake during the whole interview, his reactions and smiles didn't seem very genuine :/
오~~대단하다
where's squidward??
The Cringe Show Starring Jimmy Fallon
Why is this so awkward, i mean for Jimmy. He didn’t even make eye contact with the interviewee
LISA - 'MONEY' DANCE PRACTICE Art Ver. https://youtu.be/qBam6GR0EIU
LISA - 'MONEY' DANCE PRACTICE Art Ver. https://youtu.be/qBam6GR0EIU
Ali also should've been there 🥺
Lee-Jung jae Started his carrer as a model. hand he is one of the most handsome korean male actor in his ages. That is the reason why many Korean feel sorry that if people around the world don't know how handsome he is.
how could they miss out Ali???
If you haven't watched the squid game yet, watch it right away! I'm jealous of people who haven't seen it yet. I want to feel the fun of the first time I saw it again.
4:50 i’ve heard about jimmy falon’s fake laugh, but never knew what they were talking about. now i do
Squid game is the one place where every country comes to together and not being hated as a K drama
They are so beautiful it's CRAZY
“I’m not giving any spoilers” **shows a clip of the show**
very funny movie drama
squid game is them exposing what they are doing to humanity through this movie
I simply cannot believe that people are really watching this!!!! The dumbest thing ever!!!!!!
ا
Fallon is just the worst.
He literally spoiled the whole ep 1 lmfao
Jimmy was so fake on this one
So painful to watch how Jimmy had to fake that long ass laughter 🙂
Squid game is the best ever bjnge watching kdrama of all time.. it's incredible, it's creepy, it's adventurous, it's emotional everything..I just loved it ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Why is Squid Game more popular than Alice in Borderland?
it's so funny seing them use a playstation led lol
All died in the series 😅
I want Ali with them for the interview
where is the Indian actor?
where is ali?
Mmmm🤔??? I wonder whats everyone is going to be for Halloween?🤔
jimmy is so awkward. how can americans find a boring host like him funny?
what she can speak English? cool
한국 드라마에 멋진일들이 일어나고 있네요  이정재씨 나이가 들수록 더 멋있어요
Finally the people who called korean dramas cringe where are you now 🥵
What beautiful human beings 😍😍
The name of the doll is red light green light
the entire internet has gotten obsessed with hoyeon and honestly, same. girl absolutely dominated her first acting role
Squid game is the best
Love From India, kerela❤️🔥🇮🇳
This is terrible it should be taken off the TV and any  other platform what is wrong with people that allow this terrible game we now let Korean people do this to our children.  Why don’t we a law to get this off of any meda
“Right now” - he’s so cute 😊
2:27 this is the most beautiful man!
The whole series is great!
American woke culture has ruined their cinema. Can’t watch it without getting BS political/social views jammed down your throat.  can’t wait for Korean + other forms of cinema and theatre to emerge now
Jimmy is so awkward holy shit
I love that drama they excellent job and amazing actor and actress .❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘
쉬벌 머라고 하는지는 모르겠지만 오징어 게임 화이팅이다!! 주모 여기 샷다내려!!!!
Wow Jimmy, way to ignore the girl. Not one question to her.
They are all so pretty! WTF!
i love all of them
Can we all appreciate Sae-byeok debut acting and how talented she is instead of only talking about her looks.
White people are the one pushing squid game. I am not saying it is not good. Actually it is very good. But had this same show been played by blacks actors, it wouldn’t even came close to what we have now.
how does jimmy understand korean im so confused
Where's Ali and O Il Nam?
이건 한글자막이 없나요? ㅜㅜ
one of trash netflix series
자랑스럽고 멋진 우리나라 배우들👍👍
4:57 Jimmy: No spoilers.. And the next minute he shows the clip of  the epic Massacre scene and Ali's angel hand.. WTH, you just spoiled a whole episode bro🙄
Soooooo goooood but even better if bts were in it
This girl Hoyeon is definitely gonna make it big!!
Jimmy fake laung makes me so uncofortable.
I really want to see Pakistan guy

First time watching jimmy, does he always stutter like that? 🤨
fuck these american nighttime show host make us look lame as fuck.
ladies and gentlemen - HER
Where is ali??
Jimmy Fallon is so incredibly boring my god
Where is ALI!
I love the way that they speak their own language in an international tv show.
is it just me or they speed up the video when the casts are speaking?
GAME of thrones squid GAME  hungar GAME GAME  whats next?
Dont usually watch this kind of show😑 This host make me reassuring myself, he just got famous by acting like a armature reporter that just fake laugh and unprepared scripts 🤢
Why is Anupam Tripathi not invited?
How epic would have been if these wonderful people would've been on Conan instead of fake laughing Jimmy. Well, not all great things last.
Anyone watch it in Korean? (If you don’t already speak Korean)
Woooow, that's the train to Busan dude, the movie was very cool.
Nah cuz where tf is my son ali at???
we need ali
*The fact that they’re korean and can speak a little english is just fantastic to me.*
Watched it twice already lol
4:52 literally the fakest laugh i haveever heard…
Thank god I didn't watch this until after I finished the show. Man, the clip they showed would have ruined the suspense!
3:43 what we all came for
Hoyeon got me falling in love with her the first second I watched squid game 😌
Henlo
How adorable when she spoke english 😍
OMG son encantadores 😘😘🎉🎉🎉✨✨💖💖🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊
Awesome series ❤️ from India 🇮🇳
When I watch the first episode my heartbeat was normal, but the more I continue to watch my heartbeat is getting faster and my body temperature is getting warmer. I'm so scared for the life of my favorite characters.
Jimmy is such a fake person
[ 🇰🇷 south korea film industries 🇰🇷]  has become #1 when it's comes to making world quality movies and series when hollywood bollywood & other films industries too busy doing politics and propoganda rather than improving and working hard on the art of cenema .
https://youtu.be/w78EywgF0zU.  Squid game benin😎 you will love it.
surreal que a única pessoa que fala inglês bem responde 1 pergunta em 5 segundos KKKKKKK
GOSHHHH why did it have to be fallon interviewing them
Bruh he nailed the pronunciations of their names, they actually got him to sit down for 10 minutes to learn it
one of the most overrated show.
Ali deserves appreciation 😩
ONLY LIKE THIS COMMENT IF YOU LOOKED UP "Gematria Effect News 22" VERY IMPORTANT!
Well I hope this proves that never to  underestimate a Kdrama..... a reality check for all  ignorants and haters!✌🏼
Ugh english is so annoying
He didn’t ask any question to Hoyeon Jung and didn’t let her talk. Am I the only one to see this? :/
The guy who played Sang woo was such a great villain and person in real life. I was really touched when he said that he wanted to meet Jimmy and called him brother.
Damn Korea is killing it !!!! Love squid games! 💓
e
Hajoon looks so handsome and cute here💓
Love Fallon doing great work Kimmel sucks man
bro they make them look so old in the show
American media ruins everything lol.

Jimmy fallon is so drunk.
I still need to watch Train to Buzan
So where is Ali?
Squid Game was an okay series. Compared to all the dumpster juice movies and programs coming out of America it’s an upgrade.
4 people in the clothing of black and background of pink just like 4 members of Blackpink. I think they somehow deeply related 🤔🤔🤔
They look like they don’t even wanna speak English 😂😂
Kmovies...kpop...kseries...korean entertainment the best🎉💯❤️
It's by no means a bad series, but it isn't something that hasn't been made before. This is very much Battle Royale that came out more than 20 years ago in series format. Heck it even draws parallel to Hollywood's own Saw series. Watched the whole season, and at the end I'm kinda like, ok done that, next. Not even looking forward to season 2 that much, it will be put on a queue list if it comes about
All seem like great people but I don’t really get the hype of the show was pretty cool but dubbing just makes it look so cheesy and weird
All kdrama fans and BTS army right now 😚😚😚😚😚
How do you die movie and how does the blood look so real
ho yeon jung is the cutest
how is jimmy fallon still allowed to interview anyone he's soooo awkward
아직은 갈길이 멀지도 모르지만 한국의 고유명사 그대로 쓰이고 읽히는데 불편함이 없기를 바라봄니다
Jimmy's right. When I see Jung-jae, I don't see villain. All I see is baby boy baby with a beautiful smile that could light the room lol
jimmy fallon loves korean. Cringey
Squid game is a awsome movie , but since i hear the sound of the doll in green light red light game i have some nightmare about it , and i not even touch a single doll since that happends . 🤣
Me encanta la sencillez de estos actores hasta cierzo punto la ingenuidad con la que hablan.     10/10/2021
What a Season and Serie! It was so great and emotional
Is anybody calculate the prize in dollars till watching the show?
Jimmy laugh is so forced bruh-
Fun fact: My mom (who is Korean!) watched the show and the actual translation of the "red light, green light" phrase the doll says isn't actually red light green light, but "the flower is about to blossom"

Ali will always be a bro
오징어 게임
Where is Ali?
Squid game was pretty good
Their skin is soooooo perfect!!!!
Jimmy fake laughs again at 4:57, like he does everytime. Why does he want to please the celebrities when the joke sucks, I don't see other tonight hosts doing the same thing as he does.
hae-soo: I figured out the show was popular right now. Jimmy: *WYGSFVIUYWKJESDVGTUYEVRHKSVGWYSVTGSRTWEY BAHAHAHAHAHAH*
Ok but the first game was spoiled in the trailer. Relax ppl
Jimmy was so awkward and uncomfortable to watch on this interview.
The first thing I would’ve said was why did you kill allí
I love how my boy ali 🇵🇰 saved him in end in the trailer before he was tripping 😁👍🏻
Why isn't Ali in there
I love Hoyeons English smmmmm 🥺💖💖💖
Now you made me watch the show. I was avoiding it before...lol
대박!!!  오징어게임도, 배우들도 모두 최고입니다.  짝짝짝~~~ 다음엔 황동혁 감독님, 001번 오일남 할아버지도 지미팰런쇼에 초대해 주세요.
우리 배우님들 멋쪄요~♡
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Jimmy weird af
The thing I love the most about Squid Game is that one of the kindest, most likeable and most sympathetic characters is a Pakistani Muslim. It was very refreshing for someone from the background not to be cast as an antagonist or terrorist. The world can learn much from this.
I wanted to see Lee Yoo-Mi, Yeong-Su Oh, Kim Joo-ryeong, Heo Sung-tae, Anupam Tripathi and Lee Byung-hun in the show next
Just not the same when theyre not there..
The part that they stuck to their native languages is the best part!
I have  to watch it all Again! First time , English dubbed because of wife ( I hate dubbed since I don’t feel their true emotions) second time, I’ll watch it alone with subtitles! How I normally do! Great show
I wished we got to hear Hoyeon talk now she’s stunningly amazing
Me coming here after watchinf Squid Game , just to prove to my subconcious that they all still alive
Havent seen fallon in years, he looks really weird, disconected I would say, he has changed a lot
Where is Ali ???!!!
Season 2 - Hide & Seek, Catch/Tag and Hopscotch
Am I the only one who cringed throughout the entire video cause of jimmy
That is a plagiarized movie
Wheres Ali???!?!?!???!?!
Best drama ✨💜
baby squid. that's the cutest thing ever!
this game is nut
i love squid game, it a crazy, scary and emotional kdrama,,, very good cast ever
Was the Korean  video part pre-recorded? There are subtitles already when they were answering.
hoyeon is an absolute marvel 💜
The hunger games>>>>>>>
You didn't ask the girl any questions? She's like the second lead in the movie... And the best actor in it
Why didn't he ask Hoyeon any questions?
Believe it or not Jimmy Fallon really make sure he's guests are comfortable.
와 이제는 이 쇼가 친숙함^^
I'm not going to be a spoiler, I wash all episode and it's a great serie
Shes so pretty
Squid game speaks of a little discussed reality and reflection is so necessary. I'm so happy that the k dramas are finally getting the attention and recognition they deserve! There are so many talented and amazing people around the world who are not valued
Omg they’re all so good looking 😍😍😍😍
thank god its in korean.
Park is so handsome
I LOVE ALI AAHHHHH
SQUIDDDDDDDD GAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Park haesoo so CUTEEEEE AND His eyes when Jimmy told us ABOUT His child im GONNA cry
Hoyeon barely had a turn :(
the cringe, shoutout the actors for handling this well
Hey where my boy sang wu (dude with the glasses btw)?
Should have included Anupam Tripathi in this. He was a main character in this.
I watched it when it 1st came out since I love watching Kdramas & movies. I got my fam & friends to watch it. It's so good!
Learn English
Where's my boy Ali?
It’s such a creative show - gory but really creative. There’s nothing like it.
I can imagine prequels to this amazing show especially if you seen a certain episode.
I feel the worst for Ali that man died after being betrayed
It’s so amazing that they’re all trying to speak some English to be respectful even if they may not be fluent (ho-yeon’s English is great btw) ❤️ - many English people wouldn’t be able to speak any Korean
i wish conan interviewed them also :D
Bro could’ve got that haircut but decided to go with red?
They're so attractive ughh
Lee Jung-jae plays his trifling, loser character so well, I didn't realize how hot he is until now.
Rueuhsbsbsozbd
Hoyeon😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
"No spoilers tonight". I think him saying that you get shot and the clip showing that people are dead is a huge spoiler. I was shocked when the first person was killed. Taking that away from whoever hasnt started watching this brilliant show yet :\
Is it just me or is jimmy starting to be really fake and boring like his laugh and his lack of the conversation….
This is the reason why I love Jimmy Fallon ❤️
Jimmy is so cringe
And yet yal still beating us up 😒
One of them says something Jimmy doesn't understand.  Jimmy: "I LOVE YOU MY MAN YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU YOU'RE MY MAN" .  Jeez calm down.
Jimmy's fake laughing is so awkward. I get that it's his job but Jesus christ 🤦🏻‍♀️ his fake personality  kills me inside
The funniest thing about this interview is Jimmy's reactions   And you already know why 😏
this was amazing! i love squid game
He didn’t ask the amazing actress any questions!
where tf is ali
Jimmy says no spoilers but revealed the first shocking kill scene of the show with the 1 2 3 red light doll. smh
back in 5 seconds
It's amazing how Hoyeon acted for her first time. I love her
4:52 ooouuukayyyy
2:15 Lan koreli kubilay aka
Wanna throw up...Jimmy F is so over excited!!!
People keep saying he spoiled the first game… but it’s the title of the episode.  I think the biggest spoiler was showing that Ali saves him by catching him when he trips.
What an awesome show and cast! Will definitely be looking out for their other projects❤️
Top
In uk school are telling their parents not to let kids watch this show because some kids are re-enacting the show
Ali should’ve been there too
Jimmy Fallon has mastered the art of fake excitement and fake laughter. 😆
Go check out this new track Squid Game by @dpartmusic https://youtu.be/9NHRSBZ_lxc
chinos weyes
Why wasn't the character Ali there?
Little do they know that the only reason we were watching is for sae byeok
I’m in love with park hae soo
Sorry for English speaking person but the first game sound much scarier in original language when that doll start to sing
Series like Squid game. Movies like Parasite. Music like K-pop. Technology like Samsung and LG. Cars like Hyundai and Kia. South Koreans dominates everything they do!
I’m so proud to be korean
The Indonesian dude couldn't make it?
i despise sang woo
I could never watch this show, because with just that one little scene that Mr Fallon showed, there’s already tears coming to my eyes and there wasn’t even any verbal interactions between the characters.
The show was great, I hope there will be a season 2!
Dude, Jimmy is awkward enough with English speakers, but watching him interview a foreign cast is painful af. Like I'm glad the cast got the exposure but I feel bad they had to interact with this guy.
im here only for the girl
omg she’s speaking English
I’m assuming there is a translator that translates what jimmy says? The translator does it fast tho, they respond almost right away.
#1 on Netflix in 90 COUNTRIES…this just shows how far Squid Game has come in less than ONE MONTH
they all are so beautitfullll!
Cast of squid game huh? Then tell me, where's Ali?
Dear lord, i haven't watched Jimmy in a couple years... he actually managed to become faker.
im sorry but why does jimmy seems a bit awkward and overly hyped its not a hate comment but something i observed
Can we have there skin secrets though !?! 😍
Jimmy looks weird and shy on this one. Hmm, interesting.
Spoilers alert !
Bruh this movie sucks
Yessir let's go
With every second of this I realise more and more how much I don't like Jimmy Fallon
This show was a 6/10 not bad but absolutely not what they hyped it to be
For those who love Lee Jung Jae in Squid Game.  Please watch his other drama on Netflix:  Chief of Staff.  One of his best dramas.  I love it.
They don't speak English coz they can survive 🧧
Jimmy, did we watch the same show? Gi-hun is far from a lovable character... I disliked him from the first minutes of the show and I was definitely not rooting for him.
masterpiece.
"[speaking native language]" lmao i wonder which language that is
why is this guy a talk show host when he seems to struggle to form a sentence properly
♥️♥️♥️📚
Fake Jimmy laugh as always, he didn't even understand and already was forcing his super fake laugh
them trying to speak english for us is so good too! I love hearing Korean and I also appreciate their efforts!
Introverted myself adding squid game to the list of things considered cool but I didn't watch list
The “Squid game” and “Alice in borderland” are the best shows I’ve ever seen! 👏🏾
I never knew Korean dramas are this gripping, amazing and really fresh too! After watching "It's Okay To Not Be Okay" and "Squid Game", now I'm a big fan!
He didnt really spoil the first game. It was in the trailer.
Jimmy being nervous to say anything
Koreans are just splendid when it comes to drama. I hope more and more series come up and we get to see more of korean drama.
I love this for them
So disappointed and cringing at Jimmys interview skills. Why did he ignore the girl? Everyone in the west are going crazy over her aswell and she is sensation right now. Pathetic. Like have some awareness Jimmy.
Old boy Forgotten I saw the devil The call Some of korean most thriller movie.. There r many actually.
Why did Jimmy only talk to one guy. It was so disappointing, time may have been limited but the entire attention was going to that one guy, and not even to the main star of the series. He could have atleast asked one question to all apart from the guy he was talking to.Have some social awareness Jimmy.
The best ever love them all 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤️❤️👌✌️👍❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fallon's pronunciation of their names hurt me inside...
Green light, Red light is almost same kid's play like "mirror" 😊 it was my childhood school game.
JIMMY FALLON INVITED THEM TO THE SHOW?????
Spoiler alert !!!!
Jimmy you spoiled the show. You said they get shot. 🤷🏻‍♀️ no spoilers c’mon 😂💗💗
Where is Ali the actor 😔
ในขณะที่เมืองไทยฮิตและได้รับความนิยมไม่แพ้กัน!! ...... แต่ทางการไทยออกมาบอกว่าหนังเรื่องนี้อาจจะเป็นตัวอย่างในทางที่ไม่ดีในการใช้ความรุ่นแรงให้แก่เด็ก อาจเอาไปเป็นตัวอย่างที่ไม่ดีและเลียนแบบได้!!! แต่พวกเราส่วนใหญ่คิดว่ามันตลกและงี้เง่าสิ้นดี!! 🤣🤔
Houeon sounds so natural when she speaks English.
Did he not interview Hoyeon Jung at all?
Jimmy providing English subs must be appreciated like how this platform was breaking barriers from other South Korean artists he was interviewing previously until now proving we don't need to speak the same language in order to understand each other.
Awww baby squid is too cute 😍😂
Respect to HoYeon for speaking in english while the others speak in korean
8년전에 런닝맨은 중국인 친구랑 중국지막 켜고 같이 봤는데 지금은 미국인 친구랑 지미펠런쇼를 자막없이 보는날이 오네요 ㅋㅋㅋ
Nice!!
와... 한국어 한국인들이 지미펠런쇼에 ㅠㅜ 국뽕 차오름!! 대다나다 넘 잼나게 봤어요 ㅠㅠ 꼭 영어를 쓰지 않아도 한국이 표준 중 하나처럼 보이게 된 날이 오다니...
Hey where's my boy Ali he should have been here
4:50 Jimmy be like : Fake laughing mode turned on
<3
ok but is it just me or is jimmy really really awkward? some empathy would have gone a long way to have a better interview than this
My wife speaks the best English sheesh
How tf did Jimmy say all their names without stuttering 😂😂😂 i would been like chiyon pion khion 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
this show is so freaking good. it better win an award!!!!!
So u mean to say hae soo's kid is like the luckiest charm
i love the fact that jimmy fallon it's the only man and show who doesn't fake the reletionship with the famous korean people,starring with bts,black pink,twice,the director of parasite and the cast of squid game. he is really genuine,real with these people and he's really a big fan of these people. i hope he continues to be like this and i really don't want to know that one day he was really fake because he is really incredible,gentle and respectful with the korean people and not like other people (i'm talking about you, james corden and ellen degeneres)
The fact that Gi-Hun has played a villain in most of the Korean movies n the way he has played such a character shows how his real acting skills !!
GOOD MORNING MR. FALLON BLESSINGS MASSIVELY , THIS SQUID GAME HAD ME ON THE EDGE !! AND YES THAT DOLL IS SOMETHING ELSE👧WITH THE TURNING OF 180.
What about Ali Bruh
"무궁화 꽃이 피었습니다"가 영어로는 "Red light Green light"로 번역되었던데 한국어에 비해 말 길이가 너무 짧아서 주는 느낌이 다름. 오징어게임에서는 "무궁화 꽃이 피었습니다"도 느리게 말하지만 실제로 어렸을 때 놀았을 때는 "무궁화 꽃이~" 이렇게 처음엔 느리다가 "피었습니다!!!" 이렇게 뒤에는 엄청 빠르게 말해버려서 긴장감 훨씬 높은 게임이었다고.. 물론 걸린다고 총 맞는 건 아니었지만 ㅋㅋㅋ 그리고 원래는 걸린 사람도 술래랑 새끼 손가락 잡고 있는 다음에 남은 사람들이 달려가서 풀어주고 같이 도망치는 재미로 했던 게임인데 이 점도 알아줬으면 원래 그렇게 잔인한 게임은 아니라는 걸
It just gives me a feeling I can’t describe when I get so invested in a show and it’s characters who I’ve never seen act in anything else, then see them live and how humble and humorous they all are. It’s a certain self confirmation that there is still hope for the future.
My biggest flex is that Hae-soo and I have the same birthday
bigger than what? 😏
I've really gotten into Korean shows, especially since watching Vincenzo on Netflix, I'm just so gripped by them, can't believe how much I enjoy them even in a different language!
As a Korean, I didn't know it would become this famous. I thought only Koreans could relate to this but global people are enjoying this.
I'm addicted to Squid Game!!! I'm not sure what to do with myself waiting for season 2!
Who’s here after watching Squid Game? 👍
I swear Jimmy seems so fake in this interview man
hi
Wooooooooooooooooooo https://youtu.be/diiooam45NU
Sana yumaman ang TAONG nakabasa nito at makatulong sa maraming tao. Claim it!  Pa subscribe na rin mga idol!
he asked everyone questions one-by-one, except Hoyeon. When it was her turn, he never directed it to her, he just made it generic :(
Marble episode was the absolute worst hahaha my heart still hurts
Go, Korea! 💙💚💛🧡💜
the 1 isthe boy and the one is the GUrrRrrr
Hoyeon english is 👌🏼
they must be thinking damn Americans are loud and get excited about everything🤭
Why nobody is inviting Ali to any interviews 😑
Sae byeok was like rm ( who could speak English )  And other 3 member were like other bts members who were speaking in Korean  🤣🤣🤣
This was a 9/10 movie for me Very good
WHEN THEY PLAYED THAT SEEN WITH ALI I WAS SCREAMING AND CRYING! I LOVED HIM SO MUCH OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
no questions to hoyeon?
What a art. imagine if they make A movie about Usiro and torra and the crews and cast are working on that movie
wtf hajooon doing here
Beautiful show though very suspense my heart jump every games!!
Why didn't he ask any questions to the girl???
We used to play red light green light when i was kid..... 🇵🇰
No spoilers? He literally described the first game they play lol
I'm glad they're getting the recognition they deserve, lol
Welcome to the korea  한국사람입니다
1:38 CHIGUM RIGHT NOW 🤤🥵🔥
can yall saying him mentioning the first game or the consequences is a spoiler when the trailer literal shows the beginning of the red light green light game and literally shows the first 2-3 murders? God, some of yall annoying and juss love sayin shit, well shut up🙄
Korea is a country bursting with talent. They really deserve more recognition.
Hoyeon Reminds me of Zendaya idk why 😂
Where the hell is Ali?????????
How can they leave this show in the hands of Fallon. He is terrible at this.
Also, it bothers me so much that they didn't ask Hoyeon any questions. One because she's a huge star, and two she's a woman and her perspective would be so great about this show.
Jimmy: No spoilers tonight, I'm not giving anyone spoilers. Also Jimmy ( a few minutes earlier): They play Red Light Green Light, and if you get caught, you get shot."
So why would not you do the same invitation for One of the most legendary series of Netflix which is way more too qualified than Squid Game , it is called “ DARK “
oh man, Ali, what a legend. I will say no more for no spoilz. <3   ahhh.... the actors are so lovable and cute! especially Jung-jae, even if he does anything bad I can't help but like him cause of how well he portrays Gi-hun!
새삼 한국인배우,가수들의 인기가 많아진게 느껴지네 한국인으로서 너무너무 자랑스러워요 ㅠㅠ❤
Everybody knows that Jimmy almost had a stroke while saying those names
While the US (Hollywood) continues to be stuck on promoting Agendas and smut instead of producing creative, inspiring, artistic, and wholesome entertainment; people like myself will continue to be entertained by Kdramas.
man i cant stop thinking about this girl ...she is so beautiful, adorable !😍😍
We're is ali
오징어 게임  진짜  난리났네 ㅎㅎ
“im not giving away any spoilers!”  *right after giving away the entire first ep*
I finished it in 2 days 🙏
월클이네…
Kapan ya Indo bisa kayak Korean. Mereka proud gunain bahasa Ibu mereka untuk jawab2 pertanyaan di acara international. Jadi penasaran kalau mereka cast nya Indonesian trs ada salah satu yang memilih untuk jawab pakai bahas Indo, bakal dibully gak ya sama netizen? 🤔
I'm just glad that i studied Korean Language when I was 5 and it paid off by watching kdramas without needing eng dub
They are all so beautiful
overrated show, alice in borderland is better
Korea actually has a lot of awesome movies and shows. My favorite is The Good The Bad and The Weird.
This is one of the greatest shows I’ve seen in a long time! Well done 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
The story isn't that special but the cast are fantastic actors. Just finished it.
Park HAE Soo U make me impressed.
More love for Ali.
The most likeable cast, with the most unlikeable host.
I love how the whole world is acting like Alice in the borderland doesn't exist
They look like the same man in the thumbnail...  the last one with a wig
English please
WHERES ALI AND OLD MAN
Was Jimmy starstruck or something, sounds like he was talking gibberish, or was he being told what to ask? Just an innocent comment though
*Lee jung Jae plays as a Villain in another Movie* Viewers: why is he a villain with that charming Friendly Face
It's like lottery!!! So overrated but that leading actor is a brilliant actor 🔥🔥🔥
Why didn’t you ask the girl questions? Seems pretty sexist! You asked all the men two questions each.
u haven't watched squid game yet if u didn't fall for the girls'(Jennie's bff) charismatic beauty 🔥
I'm really addicted to that bloody cute doll
4:52 Cue fake laugh
Why does main pop media have to ruin everything
👍👍👍👍👍
주모👍🏻
SQUID GAMES DIRECTOR IS A REAL BLINK HE MADE THE SET ALSO IN BLACK AND PINK. THAT'S THE POWER OF BLACKPINK.
U will get a korean ad
Okay, Jimmy you're seriously not a good interviewer. We are really disappointed.
thank u for loving our show!! luv from korea
تبارك برنامجك ياجيمي الزق
Just finished this amazing series! Nice to see the actors all smiling and happy :)
So nobody is talking about the fact that Hoyeon is the only one who can also speak english omg ??
ASIA RISING!
Of course hoyeon speaks the best English 😫girl boss
So where can i buy this green jacket. 😅
I am a simple man, I see Hoyeon, I like the video
I didn't like the way Jimmy treated the girl. She was ignored by him.
I don't know why everyone is ignoring oh yung su ie. Oh ll nam😔😔😔😢😢😢😭😭😭😭
IM SORRY BUT THE WAY YOU SAY THEIR NAMES IS JUST DISTURBING!!!!
That's not the face you put behind a mask
Hoyeon is gonna get a lot of new roles in future movies and drama
SQUID GAME IS THE BEST 👍
I wish Ali was there too in the interview
"You're so charming  and like, lovable, we're all rooting for you"  Literally the first thing the show portrays is how he mistreats his mother, how succeptible he is to any sort of gambilng and drugs, how weak he is, how reliant on others to protect him he is, and how little control he has over his life. Not quite "charming and lovable".
Every danganronpa fan who watch squid game will realize something about this movie...there death game that is.
only one cast can speaking english well 🥺
why didnt they invite ali :(
Trending and over 7M view WOW
What a masterpiece. I almost cried at the marbles scene, and when the old man was laying in his bed at the end of the movie, a very sad ending.
❣️hae soo❣️
When Jung Jae smiles he looks so familiar with HM Son,a South Korean Football star
4:52 how fake is that laugh
https://youtu.be/z5z0UFjek1g
Fallon didn't take much notice of Ho Yeon and also he spoiled the concept.  Please someone else do a better interview. Colbert?
they're all so fine
Repeat after me : “Mughunwa cochi pioet sumneida”
Cozy in a
Jimmy’s fake laughs are so annoying.
Actor Jung Jae (Gihun) just sitting right there but i can feel his charisma even im watching him in my phone screen. I love Gihun and Sae Byeok so much <3
Best thing on Netflix since The Platform
WHERE IS ALI ABDUL
I've a big crush on WI ha jooon
O.M.G love all this Actor i AM Very Adicted Love so so so much 👌😁❤️
Hoyeon is speaking English really fluent........Watch as she becomes one of the best stars
Overrated!
i dont have any problem with Koreans but man they are so look a like. I was so confused while watching squid game hahaha
me seeing who the members of the opposing clan in clash of clans are:  0:10
HoYeon Jung resembles of Zendaya to me
A perfect Korean childhood game for Season 2 is 말뚝 박이 (..i don't know how to translate that game). Its perfect because its already a very dangerous game in real life that can cause severe back injuries hahahaha. The channel Korean Englishman introduced it once!
Do more countries have exactly that korean 'red light, green light' childrens game as well? In the Netherlands it's called 'Anne maria Koekoek'
I love them sooo much!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️
I need subtitle now !!! 😵😵😵
So this is doll same like I had in child book like 'Nabam hello. Tubin Hello '
The game is not darkness, but humanity is.😔
와우!! 너무 좋다~~💕
Not gonna lie but I actually liked this interview
No spoilers but I'll tell you the massive doll shoots people 😂😂😂
My gosh, I forced myself to come back to Jimmy Fallon's show in almost 5yrs just to watch this clip, and I am almost amazed how he still haven't learned the skill to tone down his over-the-top, off-putting, oh-so-fake laughter... I would have much loved to see Conan O'Brien as a host for the interview.
The "thank you for having us"
The girl is best  and the cop Hwang was also best actor and then the seller something and main actor
bruh you forgot the indian dude :(
Imagine if someone ruins 6.9M views
Who's here for the 7m views?
where is gong yoo??
ILY HOYEON ❤️🦑
worldwide trending
Hoyeon jung’s English is pretty impressive and her acting in the show it’s is even better!
lol
And they waited 12 years to release it..
this drama really teaches us to play outdoor games than mobile games..☠
Why is he so visibly uncomfortable? Dont fake laugh, its awkward..
Thanks to Netflix, and God bless America.
Spoilers Jimmyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!
03:55 can watch it over and over againn 😍❤
Where's gong yoo
No one talking about the way she said 'Chulsoo' 🥺 please so cute
Hehe boy and grrr
이정재 나이가 50살 이란거 알면 더 놀랄껄 You'd be more surprised to know that Lee is 50 years old
the detective knows english tho
Jimmy is such a terrible interviewer and this video is proof, like he’s just asking fluff questions and his reactions seem so awkward and inauthentic. Please this wonderful squid game cast deserved a better interview especially since it was a big deal for them to be able to interact with their Western audience.
jimmy n his fake laugh at it again..
Its a good tv show.. but not as good as i expected.. i fell asleep few times while watching this because too much boring scenes.. i dont know why its become such a big deal.. theres still many otther shows that much more exciting than this.. im sorry just try to be honest
Fake laugh 🙄
They could have included Ali. I mean, he was a main character and really well-loved. And could represent the international element.
Woooow hankok idang 우리 이제 유명해진 거양?>=<  호연언니 짱~~
Love you Guys
Did anyone notice her voice is similar to selena gomez ?
isn't she so pretty??
What about Ali? He is a star as well and he deserve to be well known.
Where's Ali
I like police man 🙂 I'm crying he dead thet moment 🤧
오징어게임에 한국  톱배우 3명이 나와요 이정재  이병헌 공유  3명 모두 최고의 배우들입니다
Why is Ali not in the cast??
All. Are superb ❤🔥
I cant stand Jimmys fake laughing its worse than the marble game
The flashy walk bodily rock because underclothes intraoperatively beam abaft a dazzling maid. hallowed, amazing litter
Kinda weird seeing Gi Hun so well dressed and looking good. Lol
Show name: Squid Game Youtube: Parasite  Nani da frick 😀😀😀
I want to see Ali Abdul
can u not learn how to pronounce korean names what with the amount of korean guess uve had this past few years lmfao
Jimmy: “It’s in the first episode I’m not gonna spoil it” Also jimmy: “look at this clip here!!! :D”
HoYeon's cuteness is carrying the interview
Weeks has been passed, so Jimmy didn't make any spoilers
정호연씨 영어 들어보면 토종인데 엄청 잘하시네요. 진짜 21세기형 배우다! 흥해라
he didnt ask hoyeon ANY questions?? like direct questions to her.. unless it didnt get aired!! hopefully!!
Gi-hun leaves his plane to his daughter to go after the Makers of the game...Thats his 'calling'...waiting for Season 2
Why jimmy so cringe in this lmao
Heyyyy
❤️
The guy in red was in the king monarch na
I’m obsessed with the Squid Game cast 🥺
I watched it yesterday and can't stop through the end .
미국토크쇼를 자막 없이도 볼 수 있는 날이 오다니
Most overhyped show ever
한국어 댓글 찾아요
اكو عرب بالفديو🤣
Could you imagine... having a kid... and that kid being born at the same exact time... as the first episode of a tv show about murder premieres... and you were in that show...
jimmy fallon is the worst interviewer he is so annoying
https://youtu.be/EHHdRCQF0Jg this is real squid game Jimmy...Hehehehe
Anybody else has a huge crush on hoyeon? Goddamn
nice
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
one thing i learned from squid game is thank you on korean
Jimmy’s laugh is fake af lmao 😂😂😂
I forgot they're not dead
Why is jimmy yelling
I can't wait season  2
Superdooper like that movie Squid games....its beautiful.amazing.
It's nice seeing people getting over their xenophobia in watching a foreign show but let's be honest. The main reason people really like this show is for the hyper violence in it. Yeah there's a deeper meaning behind it but still without it most people wouldn't really care. Still a great show
They are so cute and talented! Love them!
Korean films are THE BEST. Hollywood's adaptation of a great Korean film, Oldboy SUCKED.
I clicked for hoyeon jung (sae byeok ,067)(of course the others are great too) and she barely said 2 sentences 😢
Hey! I still don't understand why women aren't asked more in deph questions. the girl got to talk about only one small thing and her role in the series is just freacking amazing. she was obviously the one having great english during the interview. what a waste. booooooo. this is very disapointing
The old man , Ali and a couple other characters should have been their too.
It's time for S.Korea
Great series other than another birthday missed.
K pop is taking over the entertainment industry without nudity.
I am so glad people will know more about Park Hae Soo.    You Y'all need to watch PRISON PLAYBOOK.
A shame Jimmy didn't talk to the girl. She had never acted before and is famous in Korea for being a model. Would've been cool to know how she's prepared for her forst ever acting role or how she wanted to portray the character she plays?
I thought it was another damn musical group
이병헌 배우도..함께 나왔으면..더..좋았을듯~~!ㅎ
What a revolting little “show” of humans at their worst
정재형님 잘생긴거 보소
Jimmy Fallon is the worst interviewer, why is he still on tv?????
"people who move get shot" "I'm not giving any spoilers"  *Why are you like this Jimmy?* Edit: guys!! I know it was in the fucking trailer loll!! I'm just saying that many have suggested to just watch the show without even seeing the trailer. So, for those it does spoil it a bit.
Jimmy Fallon is truly the master of fake laughing.
You guys should watch Hae Soo's Prison  Playbook as well 🧡
I played most of those games when I was a kid, I'm from the Caribbean (sint.maarten). I played red light, green light, marbles, tug-a-war, hopscotch(similar to the glass game). the others are more Korean and not widely known.
https://youtu.be/bZB7ThLyqUl Squid games
See ..you don't need to learn English to be successful. INDIAN ARE WAY OBSESSED WITH ENGLISH AND EQUALLY ASHAMED TO SPEAK HINDI globally even in indian metro cities  .
It’s Shocking, Beautiful but unfortunately it’s 18+ 🌚
superb !
this was so awkward for them and jimmy..
People are connecting to the fact that this is pure storytelling with drama, humor, suspense and not having any forced SJW check boxes needing to be ticked. I'm still suprised it was on Netflix, the woke streaming service.
They can’t speak English only the girl but not fluently. I thought some actors can speak English in SK fluently. But they are good actors
Where is Ali Abdul
deserve. :)
ALI IS A GREAT PART OF THIS GAME
Jimmy should stop stuttering and study his script more lol
Why wasn't Ali here???
I heard i wana meet “jimmy butler” I’m high man..
I watched the first episode and got hooked. The human emotion component is very credible in this series.
Where is ali 😓
WHERE IS ALI
여론보소 ㄷㄷ
Number 456 wins the game
If I was a show I wouldn’t wanna be nominated for an International Emmy next year and be pitted against Squid Game. My chances of winning will be close to none.
Aah! ❤😍
이정재 배우가 투나잇 쇼에 나오고 진짜 대박입니다. 축하합니다.  오징어 게임  ㅎ ㅎ
TOOK THEM 10 YEARS TO FINALLY GET SOMEONE TO MAKE THIS INSANE GAME #FACTS
SHE'S AN EX SUPER MODEL 🔥🔥🔥
What happened to the girl?? That’s what the question
best cast
omg his son and the show in the same day!!! this’s crazy
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THE SQUID GAME CAST TO SHOW UP ON HERE!
Yo Ali should be here
Just korean people invading the whole world😭 they are the most entertainment county for me
Y aquí estoy sin entender ni madres jajaja simplemente por que los amo😅❤️
of course parasite is next to it
Where is Ali? He is also in the cast
This is why people need to give foreign entertainment a chance. They need to stop with all the bias, give it a chance and then decide. I know that many didn't want to give Parasite, for example, a chance because it's foreign or even kpop. Hopefully, this show helps open the minds of many close-minded people.
jimmy - "no spoilers here" also jimmy - "if you move you get shot!" ... * shows clip of  gi hun getting saved *
Squid Game episode 1  min 9:11  Improvised scene of 4:18
jimmy seems so fake idk what it is somethings just weird
I really want to dedicate myself to getting to know these actors better and their work. They have impressed me and I feel I should watch the rest of their movies out of respect for them.
My God im so happy to see them on Jimmy's show.
Japan do something,make a live action not live action adaptation.
주모 한잔더~!
hoyeon is so pretty
Im not giving any spoilers   Him in his mind : ooh I shouldnt have said that... Oooh I shouldnt have said that...
Where is Ali? And the old maaaan???
尹俐原來是在講這個喔
مافي ترجمه
Her shoes tho! Give that stylist a raise!!!
Man, why are Korean people so hot? it's outrageous, its unfair!
jimmy fallons laugh is so fake lmaooo
Jimmy Fallon is so fake when he laughs 😂😂😂
Where’s Ali?
Red light green light❤️❤️❤️
I watched the the entire season in a day. I couldn't stop watching.
Why do Americans make everything so cringy
i love you squid games ❤
This show was everything. It made me feel many emotions.
They are so attractive
I just realized the only reason i enjoyed squid game was because people died
*_Wish Anupam Tripathi was here~_*
Squid  game went bigg
Everyone sayin Jimmy spoiled the show when yall spoiling it. Not cool, man. Not cool.
The dub is the best I've heard in a foreign film. The voice actors/actresses did a fantastic job portraying the raw emotions. And kudos to the translators for making sure the dialogue resonates with the global audience. All this elevates it past most foreign movies.
Looks like Jimmy began much younger then
Watch that show - put violent garbage in your mind.
Jimmy Fallon really doesn’t know how to interview people. This is so awkward to watch.
Hoyeon's performance was outstanding!! she said in an interview that she and two other girl co-stars would take long walks after filming just to talk. In she said she would cry to them because she didn't think her acting was good, but they would comfort her. Literally biggest imposter syndrome because i would of never guess it was her first time acting
We gonna ignore the fact he never asked HoYeon a question 🥲
Hoyeon jumped from 400k followers to 17+ million (still rising) on instagram, just because of squid game. Well deserved also.
How is it that nobody is talking about the fake-ass laugh at 4:52 ?
Jimmy is screaming welcome like he never screamed before cause there's a stereotype going on that Korean talk show hosts are loud lol... Wtf Jim
Ahhhh Jimmy…..he was not introduced as loveable….rather pitiful.
💜💜💜
4:52 That's the FAKEST laugh I've ever seen.
I know who I dont want as my driving instructor
Taiwan not part of China until the Ching Dynasty sent troops to conquer it. Then very shortly after, the Ching agreed to surrender Taiwan to Japan as  they were  defeated in a war with Japan. After US defeated Japan in 1945, UN agreed  Taiwan to be independent, Taiwan had never been a part of  the old Chinese Nationalist Party, CNP retreated to Taiwan as refugees more or less, similar to the Afghans  retreated to other lands when the Talibans came in.
I love how all the actors try their best to speak English, I hope they don’t feel forced to learn English after the huge spike of popularity in English countries
Damn, Jimmy still fake laughing.
Jung Hoyeon the fastest rising star of Korea! I love her ❤️❤️❤️
Jimmy kimmel is so cringe
You can see tears in Hae-soo’s eyes when he was talking about his newborn son🥺
Baby squid. Cute!
I'm so proud of my korean oppas.
Hoyeon's english accent is so cutree😭
They're english is smooth i tell you ✨S M O O T H✨
literally not a television show in the world but ok
every single one of them could get it
Jimmy hyung, lol 😆
it's crazy how big squid game got, I bet they weren't even thinking about making an appearance here
Jimmy, your energy does not match theirs. Your laugh is all over the place. You dont have to fake your laugh and scream every time. Just talk like a normal human being.
Jimmy is so f'ing fake.
Okey  hoyeon is 28  Even I still don't believe it
Even as a westerner growing up in a "white world" looking at this unnecessarily screaming out and hyped video it honestly reminds me of those interviews in the capital in the hunger games. The pyscotic and screaming capital citizens watching as the foreigners get interviewed. Whenever I see people from other countries get interviewed or put on yelling white people shows I get second hand embarrassment. Just me?
Oh my god fake laugh of jimmy i hate it
Where's ali and grandpa 😭
The Indian actor was good too I was surprised to see an Indian actor in a korean show. We are everywhere!
Out of most Korean drammas and shows Squid Game was a dope one 👌
I I hope they don’t get mentally destroyed by Korean Hollywood 😣 many Korean celebrities committed suicide in the past 3 years because of the harsh entertainment industry there
The female actor (sorry, I'm pretty bad with names) was totally ignored, even when she talked about the doll, I wanted to know more about it.
90 countries dang
Woah already
Where is Ali????
Where is ali?
I imagine, after Jimmy taked that creepies doll, perhaps everynight he got a nightmare😂😂
It's not fair Guys. There is a Squid Game But not Octopus Game, why? :( Say No to Speciesim (Rasism)
saddest scene of Squid Game: https://youtu.be/oy3gn-hSLfg
alice in borderlands should of got the same fame or more   then  squid game
Ngl, Hae-soo is a dilf.
Hiiiiii
Anjir iklan aov nya nge idol 😂😂
The subtitles are quick AF. Live show
Shes so cute
They're alll so cuteeeee 😍

IM SUCH A SIMP🤧🤧😹😹
sang woo is the class clown i bet
Lee Jung Jae is the actor that featured in the original Korean version of the movie "The Lake House" which stars Keanu Reeves who played his character!
They’re all so adorable
Squid Game or Dark or BB? which is the best show Netflix has ever produced ?
Cant wait for s2!
기훈이형 !!!
Bindged the hole series
I am shocked squid game is so popular. I have been watching korean movies since 6-7 years and I find squid game really boring and average.
The watery couch startlingly dry because occupation greely poke astride a ambitious margin. addicted, jazzy football
456 = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. 15 = 1 + 5 = 6 Winner # 456 - > 6 # of participants 456  - > 6 # of games played - > 6  Squid game = 666 game  The masked ones represent those who rule the world.
Squid 🦑 game best show
Squid game was the role of these actors' lifetimes

South Korean Entertainment world domination
Not a single question for Hoyeon Jung? disappointment.
Did the cop really died he was so good i wish it was not true
She is so beautiful my god
Saebyeok is just sooo mmmm 😍
Squid Game is not even a television show
He should have michael myers in it since halloween kills is coming next friday!
Just finished season 1, loved it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O5TrwR8Bcw
Jimmy. Stop the fake laugh. Stop hitting the desk. It is so insincere, you look like a tool.
I would have loved it more if Anupam Tripathi was there too🥺
I'm sorry, but that pink square against the pick background is bugging me.
한국어를 여기에서 들을줄이야..
Is the first game in the show originally Korean? Bc kids in my country play it from the oldest to the youngest generation lmfao (and we’re from a completely different continent)
Ali to
so proud 👏
Congrats I really anjoyed watching it even tough I don't understand korean language I still like that movie and there was really cool parts of the movie.
한국말로 이너뷰 하는거 조낸 멋있다잉
I enjoyed watching the Squid Game very much.  Happy to wait season II soon!
Jimmy: tells first episode plot  Jimmy: no spoilers guys.   😆 🤣
It's a overhyped series
Squid Game cast, they’re all outstanding. What a great show.
The fact that jimmy said no spoilers yet he showed clips of the film and talked about the film 😆
I'm so proud of them. They were like a father to me.
Hoyeog's English is soooo good 🥰
Man jimmy are getting worse as a host  He's mumble and cant even talk straight anymore
Just finished Squid Game. Loved it, even if I still have some unanswered questions, I really enjoyed it.
After all their hardworks and efforts, they definitely deserve the recognition and hype they're getting rn.
When u reminisce all the games you played as a child in the darkest way possible.😂😂😂 🐙 🎮!
he didnt as hoyeon any questions about her character. bro thats the main person we are here to see
yeah i was interested in watching this until i realized i had to listen to jimmy cummel open his fat mouth the entire time. disliked
Watched this when it just made it to #1 and watched it just explode ever since
정호연님.... 존버타고 있었다구....
i just came for 067
You know Squid game is bigger than Queen''s Gambit.
대박 👍
I wish Jimmy spent more time trying to learn the correct pronunciation of their names.
Hoyeon's English accent though♥️
Since when did Jimmy Fallon stutters so much? Haven’t seen his show for quite a while now, I think he spoke just fine when he did Late Night
Why did youtube recommend me parasite in the top right corner..
Jimmy: I’m not going to spoil anything no spoilers.  Also Jimmy: **spoils the entire first episode**
so obvious Jimmy is drunk, probably realizes his show sucks
jimmy is definitely drunk
she is very pretty..
Where is Ali? :'(
박 하수 💗🔥
AWEEEEEE
My girl and I are three episodes in so far.
And so jimmy interviewed them
It could’t be better in Netflex.
Season 2 please.. squid game.
When it will be session 2?
지금(ji-gum) right now
kokoaa shi ji si asemnida pepp. (scanning.)
감사합니다 👍
I wish someone other then Jimmy did this interview. Very cringe.
Jimmy is either delusional or hasn’t watched more than 1 episode. Because Seong Gi-hun is NOT lovable or likable. I kind of despise that character because he’s dishonest, desperate and makes his problems everyone else’s problems.
I know wi ha-joon's smile is so cute
Round 6
น่ารักกก
Jimmy… the master of overselling 😎
They are all so good looking, koreans are dominating
Ой ну всё это успех, если аж на американском телевидении показали
youtube said that this was PARASITE
The marble game was so sad to me!😢
No one will remember them next year, remember the Slum Dog Millionaire actors
👍 LIKE FOR SEASON 2 👍
I am so happy Korean shows and movies are getting a boost by this. Koreans are so amazing when acting
FUCKING SPOILER
❤️
With huge titles like Parasite, OldBoy, and now Squid Game, Koreans are _dominating_ the film industry and I'm here for every second of it.  Edit: One more time for the folks in the back still watching M.A.S.H. and Bonanza: _DOMINATING_
0:02 but not in history. Its not the biggest show ever.
Where’s the old man?
so happy for them!! yall if you also havent watched Prison Playbook thats another show Park Hae Soo was part of, streaming on netflix watch that too!!
This show was worth watching! Totally recommend to anyone wiling to watch it!
🤣🤪💘💘💯
Why invite Hoyeon if you are going to ignore her? This was her debut as an actress and she killed it but not once he asked her a question. How rude.
Watching this right after watching a Squid Game episode is just great. It work more so for genre like Squid Game 😆
I am kinda obsessed with this cast lol Couldn't stop smiling while I was watching it
Where my boi ali?
이 드라마를 보면서 가장 기억에 남았던게  깍두기 문화가 언급이 되었던 부분 입니다  제가 어릴 땐 게임에서도 그렇고 한때 최고의 인기를 끌었던 농구 역시도  동네에서 같이 게임을 하면서  실력이 떨어지거나 키가 작거나 하는 사람들에게도 기회를 주면서  서로 맞춰 가면서 즐기는 농구문화가 형성이 되었었는데  이제는 그런 문화는 사라지고 무한 경쟁 속에 나보다 못 한 사람들은  짓 밟고 올라가려는 못된 문화들이 형성이 되는 것 같아 많이 안타깝다는 생각을 하고 있습니다  예전 처럼 조금 부족하고 떨어지면  잘하는 사람들이 같이 끌고 밀고 땡기고 해서 더불어 살아가는 사회가 형성이 되었으면 하는 생각이네요  많이 가진 자들이 베푸는 세상이 왔으면 좋겠습니다
Jimmy is so wholesomeeee AND THEY ALL AREEEE
Squid game legit is the definition of overnight success.
The concept is good but the dialogue is childish and the acting is very odd, almost like the actors are trying to be anime characters, a lot over over dramatic facial expressions and body movements
🦑 🔵🔺 🟩  오징어 게임 사랑합니다 🔥
Baby squid 😭😭😭😭😭😭❤❤❤
its so crazy to me how they're actors and there real selfs are so diff
The language barrier is making this interaction so awkward.  Nevertheless, congratulations to the cast and everyone involved to the great success! Best show in a long time!
I LOVE HOYEON SO MUCHHHH SHES SO ADORABLEEE 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Not one question for the only female cast member… well done Jimmy for conforming to Korean societal standards…
Pls.pray the rosary and devine mercy chaplet to free all countries from war, diseases, calamities, hunger, corruption, drugs, prostitution, abortion, divorce, vices and all evils.pls pray for peace and joy in all families and home...
jimmy:" i am not giving any spoilers.  but u literally spoiled the best game . which was game 1.
where is ali?
Where is Ali? He is the one of the main characters.
It’s an incredible k drama!!
Jimmy's forced laugh is hilarious Hahahahaha
Well I know what we're going to be seeing for Halloween this year...
I wish they'd have Ali more
Jimmy: "He saved you I love it!" yeah he obvisouly didn't watch the whole episode
Well done Jimmy, you didn't see something popular and immediately try to exploit it.
The show is so hyped up and for good reason, I’m glad I watched it, but I am truly traumatized:,)
What a great show, can't wait for season 2 !!
I miss bts and jimmy but squid is crazy famous
I just wanna know how this interview was possible lol
any films with the word "game" in their titles become successful
OMG I LOVE THIS😳☺
You really spoil the show . Spoiler alert
They not even there wtf instant dislike
the boy in red is very cute <3
The grrrr
(squid game doll) The secret of the doll in the squid game https://youtu.be/hN24QL4du3w
i love this series
The hold Hae Soo has on me thoughhhh
001 should be there
How is HaJin a “star” when the villain was a actually a star ⭐️
The Pakistani guy and the old man were missing in that interview.
I love how Sae Byeok knows how to speak English
Hajin is 🤩🤩🤩
i haven’t watch something like that for a while this show will be my favorite forever just wooow good job i love south korea 🇰🇷 im from iraq
I have see all season good serie 🙂👍 from Greenland
Man i was so excited to seee ALi :<
I'm so happy that the general audience has finally been able to adapt to enjoy TV shows that are not produced by the US, about a central character that is American, and foremost - in a different language. Now I hope everyone starts to go back through the rich catalog of many non-English language movies and dramas that were produced, some of the best being in the 2000s. Korean alone has so many gems, then you have multiple other countries on top of that.
The movie parasite pops up under the title😂
*I LOVE SQUID GAME* 🤩
Why is Ali not sat with them? :(
와 댓글에 한국인 찾기 힘드네 자랑스럽다ㅎㅎ😊
Idk but I'm getting such strong second hand embarrassment from Jimmy... Like this was wayyyyy out of his comfort zone and he acted so fake the whole time.... But at least the cast seem to be happy and comfortable! And I'm happy they get to express themselves comfortably in Korean! They're the best!
Why don't we see any interview with actor who played Ali?  He was amazing!  I cried my eyes out because of that character
I watched it the first night before knowing it was gonna go crazy! I just clicked on Netflix and was like "ooh this looks like it's gonna be good!"
Squid game has officially surpassed stranger things
jimmy fallon please shut the fuck up holy shit bro ur fake laugh is so fucking irritating like DAMN JUST SHUT UP YOU INFURIATE ME
That old man is the villain.
Hae Soo is so cute and humble. I love him
Where's the X icon?
Haha why did they put parasite as the movie below?
Jimmy introducing the actor of our main character just tells you he didn't watch a single second of the series. The main character is unrelatable in the first 2-3 episodes as he acts very selfish
am glad this show blew up Korean cinema is probably one of the best out there
Love that show so real and crazy and maid challenging I laugh and cry and it got my blood pressure so high, it was epic for me number ☝🏼🤧😩😅😅😭🥺😤😵‍💫😱
ALI ALI ALI bring in Anupam!!
1:29 we all knew what he was gonna say but he thought about it twice before saying it xd
Guys please watch Crash landing on you. It’s amazing 😭😭😭😭
wish they had Ali
I love how the show is getting more and more popular nice to see kdramas rising up for a change
It feels so good to see them alive, the show looked so real that I almost forgot they were acting
He literally didn’t ask Ho-Yeon a single question. So disappointed
jimmy the worst
Bi üs hets coca cola light gheissr
I’ve been a fan of korean dramas, kpop and hallyu in general since i was a teenager in middle school (2012), so seeing Korean entertainment becoming mainstream makes me feel proud but at the same time it s a little bittersweet, it was my escape from reality almost all my life and my own little bubble. What is very impressive to me is that people were saying a while ago that hallyu is just a wave and that it’ll fade quickly but it’s actually getting bigger and bigger
No. 1 in Netflix here too in Germany 🇩🇪
You're so charming and lovable- bruh we all hated him fomr the start
Guys you gotta watch Sweet Home too ..It is a masterpiece
BABY SQUID IM CRYINGGGGGGGG
It's so crazy that this is their first Kdrama (I'm talking about heyonjung) it grew big in a short time
The main character is so different from the real actor, lets just with his hairstyle
오징어게임 잼나여
Omg she's sooo pretty!!
Lol.
WHERE IS ALI!
It deserves all the hype
❤️❤️❤️❤️
There is no squids

wow she speaks good english
1945. US government took over South Korea after nuking Japan. US immediately began indoctrinated Korean kids with capitalism, materialism and selfish competition. Korea has not been independent or free for a very long time. Today, evil corporations and mortgage lending banks prey on the poor by hooking them into loans they can never repay, making them economic slaves. This is what has happened in the USA. Corporate capitalism and banks have destroyed American freedom and culture. Today, we are deep in debt, many homeless, selfish, lost, alone and greedy for a dollar. Please make corporate capitalism and bank lending illegal everywhere. This would heal the world.

Spoiler below..          Policeman's brother is the guy with black mask. Policeman gets caught and killed by his own brother  Old guy with number 1 is behind everything he's a rich guy doing this for fun. Gi-hun wins the last game
Shi North Korea just chilling
She's kind of being ignored, Jimmy hasn´t asked a direct question to her as he's done with the other 3 male actors! Loved them all in the show and I feel for them having to put up with stupid interviews like this one🙄
https://youtube.com/watch?v=5PmTYJqzuLQ&feature=share
ดังใหญ่
La Corée du Sud qui commence à être connue dans le monde comme une puissance de divertissement
is nobody going to talk about how he "understands" Korean all of a sudden :/
Getting flashbacks from me and my brother was watching korean television (starcraft broadcasts) and everyone was like, this is soo weird, long story short, here we are.
Why did this feel so awkward? Perhaps they had to take time to translate and its just the pauses or something. Idk the actors felt so charasmatic but Jimmy felt so awkward lmao could just be me
such refreshing over american actors who always act over the top korean actors are relatable and act more human
Sae-byeok is THE moment 😍
One thing specially to learn from Koreans , you don't need to change your language and accents in order to be acceptable and to be felt similar as others . Your language is what reflects your country heritage . Kudos 🔥
Yessir
Other k drama that needs to go viral & be well known are "Psychopath Diary, Alice & extra-ordinary YOU "!!!! Many more but I won't forget those.... Squid Game ~ Aww wish the character Ali was there too!!!👏🏼👏🏼
It wasn't their voices in the movie?Wow.
i feel bad for hoyeon jung shes not getting to speak much and jimmy like only said her name like once
Where is Ali!!?!!??!!!
f**k it why did they not teach me Korean in school
rip of kaiji
Jimmy, you are not allowed to laugh unless you are told to do so, it is the squid rules
Sang Woo dont try to be nice now 🤣
Thanks YouTube, apparently this is about Parasite.
It's such a fucked up show it makes you wonder how someone mentally even thought about it. It's insane but amazing. Makes you wonder if rich, elite people of the world play games like this with "kidnapped" people
translating and editing is real genius of Fallon and team every show will follow your lead esp foreign shows
Ho-Yeon Jung is My Favourite character in entire series UwU
There personlty in real life are amazing
The way he said the names smh
Where is ALI!
이게 머선 129
Amazing actors
Who else watched squid game before it blew up? I watched it Day 1
4:52 oh god please don't
Been rejected 10 years ago. But now they are one of the top. WOW!!!! God's perfect timing
Wow. Think they ever thought it’d get this big in the US?
Why isint Ali and the old man in interviews
I wonder did they feel awkward sitting there lol
nah bro the appeal is hoyeon
SO GOOD!!!!!
I don't know if anyone else realized but Jimmy was stuttering really bad, like is he ok?
Jimmy Fallons analysis of this show is SO off the mark. It’s not about what people would do for money. It’s about how capitalist systems treat the lower class.
Where is my boy Ali 😡
I hate how westerners commodify Korean Culture. Also why was Hoyeon not asked any questions??
South Korea taking over the world
Why didn't you ask any questions to the female actress? Kind of sexist
why are you so cringe jimmy?
I think Jimmy should start studying Korean lol
That's just jealousy talking.  Something haters want to believe.    My cousin operates one of Seoul's largest plastic surgery hospitals and according to him, that's completely false.  This rumour started in the 80's when it gained some popularity but these days, most of his clients are foreigners; especially asians wanting to look like Korean celebrities or "more Korean".    He says plastic surgery is not all about gaining beauty.  He sees Korean patients more for medical reasons; reconstructive surgery due to accidents or birth defects.    These days Koreans are more focused on skin and hair care--or improvements to accentuate their natural traits.  Koreans are also very health conscious, eat well, exercise, avoid stress and be happy.   Part of his practice is to discourage people from cosmetic surgery.  They have therapists on staff and suggest skincare to start with.  Good skin has a huge effect on the overall look of a person.    Those that you might see on the streets shopping with bandaged faces are definitely NOT Koreans.  These are surgery tourists, here in Seoul to get work done and shop like mad.     Apparently, no amount of plastic surgery is going to take you from "unattractive" to "gorgeous".  There has to be a certain amount of basics.    Unlike what most people perceive to be physical "beauty", this actually comes from within.  No cliche.  He adds, the reason why these actors seem attractive is mostly due to their presentation; that is smile and laugh a lot, fashionable, relaxed, and confidence without arrogance.   Of all the asians,   Koreans tend to have a softer appearance and demeanour.    Lastly, from the screen, he can tell that non of these actors have had work done.  The faces of people with plastic surgery move differently to the trained eye.  He says, the two older men might of had botox or fillers but no surgery.  Anyways, with so much online, these people have their entire lives on display.  Koreans would know if they've had work done.  Some are even very open about it.  And for celebrities, whether Korean or not, appearance is part of their job.   So stop the nonsensical hate.
I want Jung-jae so bad...
why isn't anupan tripathy in any of these interviews...
Squid game is evil Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The same vibes for me.
SHE IS SO PRETTY😭
Wheres Ali?
That’s Hoyeon’s first acting role. Isn’t that crazy??? Imagine her taking more roles she will be the biggest star in no time
"one is the boy and one is the gurr" 3:50
다른 한국의 드라마, 영화에도 관심 가져주세요~
Asians are taking over the world
오 신기하다
It was an amazing show it even made me cry!
omg she’s so beautiful 😍
Jimmy : "i'm not giving any spoilers tonight" Also jimmy : spoils the first game  All men do is lie
Lee Jung Jae looks so charming in this interview,his smile i cannot!! Also for the record he did not mostly played villain in movies and he has recorded the youngest man to win the best actor award in something like Korean Oscar.he is very talented not too mention also a very faithful guy in relationships .i like how he is low profile and protective over his personal relationship with his gf like dating is very secretive in korea for movie stars and idol unlike in western countries.he does that because he treasure the relationship so much
WOAH they are all so pretty!
Pretty rude how HoYeon Jung was like totally left out. Jimmy directly asked each of the men something, and when she was suppose to be next he skipped her? Then she took the initiative to answer the question about the doll and he like just moved on to the other men again. 🙄
Great movie. The scariest part is human greed.
정호연한테도 질문 물어봐줘…
I think Squid game is a combination of " Purge : anarchery"  a little bit of " Saw II " or the " Haunt "
People who say it over rated are the people who don’t find anything entertaining and are depressed 24/7… no joy in anything… show deserve all its love!!!
AYEEE IT'S ALL OVER THE INTERNET
Can't wait for season 2.  They are all so beautiful and talented.
I’m surprised Jung Jae plays villains, he literally has the nicest face ever.
Korea been producing amazing movies since forever but ppl just realized now..kind of like the movie call The Man from Nowhere..more violent and interesting than the John Wick movie
If this was ur first Korean netflix show and u liked it, I highly recommend Kingdom as ur next show!! 😉
Such a warm cast  Really proud as an asian love them so much and squid game  Would have been better if jimmy invited other casts too like (the old man, ali, the girl who sacrificed herself in the marble game )  But it's good to watch these casts behaving completely different than their characters in the movie  Love and blessing from bangladesh 🇧🇩 #SquidGame
Where's the old guu
I found the series very disturbing and I wish I had never watched it.  I would have cut it off after the killing but my husband watched all of it so I saw most of it, unfortunately.
the doll lok kawaii to me
Squid game is so famous right now
💙⃢💚⃢💜⃢💛⃢❤️
.
Crazy how it hasn’t even been a month and there so big now … crazy
I have just finished this and it was sooo sad :((
Squid game is the worst thing I have ever seen
Haesoo: Jiguem, right now  he said it with so much swag in him
แต่ละคนสวยหล่อ
Bruh, so first BTS, then Squid Game Yes, get all the recognition kdramas deserve.
''I'm not giving any spoilers tonight'' literaly not even 1 minute before that ''This doll has camera eyes and if you move she shoots you''........ Dumbass.
They should’ve brought the pickpocket 🙄
do they have makeup on or is their skin really that perfect (the man dem)
I think it got so big so fast because this is similar to what a Hunger Games Series might look like, and a lot of people want a Hunger Games series.  Or also Battle Royale.  Just heard of this series this week, so I started watching it last night and got to episode 6 before I fell asleep.  Today I will attempt the rest.
I really love that they’ve gained so much popularity and success without even having to speak english! That warms my heart!
Lmao why is jimmy so awkward 😭😭😭😭
Why is jimmy so nervous and uncomfortable
Me who is searching for ali  Where the heck is the mann?
baby squid, OMGGG so cute
(Spoiler warning): I hope they come out with Season 2 before the shows hype begins to die down also I Have a feeling that "NOT EVERYONE WE THINK IS DEAD" Could actually still be alive since some of the body's are not seeing carried into the coffin. Most Main characters of the show you see them get dragged into the coffin so that could be a "Hint" for the return of our favorite! ALI he was never officially shown to be dead, The police officer as well. What if we already met the characters who have Won the previous Squid Games but never realized it?
Jimmy’s interview skills need work. Though it’s hard to do a good interview through video
Why ali isn't in this,I mean he is amazing, I checked the cast of this show and there was not Ali's name I mean This show has got so much hype cause of ep-6  And the main reason for that is Ali😔
Not seeing Ali here feels like he is still dead 😢
Would have more fun and existing with the whole caste 🤧
What's your favorite word in english?
No entiendo ni vrg
I have a crush on the main Korean girl didn't know she was a model until after I watched the serious. Now I know why she seemed attractive because she is lol
Where in the fuck is Ali
Look at my wife sitting there on the right
We missed Ali so much.
Damn bro you ain't practice their names at all?
#CoCoCool 💞
at least jimmy got their korean names right
This is the fastest that I ever click on any video I fucking love squid game 😆
😍😍😍
I think jimmy watched it dubbed..
wish we had Anupam Tripathi (guy who played Ali) on this
Loved this Squid Game 😍
Racist korean tv show.  There is a shocking and disappointing lack of diversity in that cast.
We need some Anupam Tripathi, Oh Yeong-su and Kim Joo-ryeong
I request the other Netflix drama show, " " ! Lee Jung-jae's one top's tiltle serise!
Hoyeon's English and her laugh are so cute 🥺
And of course Ho-yeon is looking beautiful as ever😭
I LOVE THEM SO MUCH
Lee Jung Jae me encanta su personalidad no es tan distinta a la serie
Hoyeon jung is so damn cute let me have her plz ❤💙
I will never get tired of saying this until I die: Park Haesoo is sooooo adorable 🥺
i am not sure if i could watch the show coz it really scares me (like it's so real) and dystopic for me. i can watch like behind the scenes instead. the actors are good looking!
i wish the guy that played ali was there
3:06 just same jack and jill 🤤🤤
Why uncle number 001 is not here? 😁
Every one agrees that south Korea is taking over the world with Kpops and k dramas🤗
Jimmy: "I'm not giving any spoilers tonight" Also Jimmy: literally spoils the first game
where's ali
댓글들보면 알수있음 왜 정호연이 이렇게 인기 있을까? 우리는 사회속의 전형적인 여성상을 원하지 않는다. 계속 발전해나갈것이다
Ya'll ready for among us part 2 this Halloween. I'm only glad people are hyping this show up because it will guarantee more seasons in the near future.
Ali didn't come???😥
god jimmy fallon is so bad at his job lol
why didnt he ask Hoyeon a question?
I saw this video in the morning and i went back at half and watched this movie and now in the night i came here writing this comment. "Squid game" waiting next episode.
Omg ang gagaling nilang umakting
Mentioning the base of pyscho robot is very impressive and it is a very detailed question from a Korean perspective
That moment when you watched it before the hype
Why is this cheap ass movie so cringe
I kept putting it off. I said don't want to see it. Yo. I watch the whole season....couldn't stop.
Language barrier sucks man
I’m so glad they don’t speak English !!! Let’s normalize speaking native languages
any one remember the school books with SAM and ANN? by Sullivan
Where’s Ali?😢
NEW WORLD is such a good movie if ya haven't seen it
I love how uncomfortable Jimmy is during this. Got him some humble pie.
Best Netflix Series No Doubt 💎 can’t wait for season 2 🗿❤️
The plot is simple but the execution is fucking awesome!!!
아잇 난 못알아듣겠다...
자랑스러운 대한민국 !
Did you guys like it ?
Squid games cast breaths  Jimmy Fallon: ahahahahahahahahahaahahha
I used to make and eat 달고나. And because of  this movie, I made it again and eat it.  🪡😋
Even Jimmy got starstrucked lol
We need Ali in these talk shows
Korean Domination
문화강국의 힘 자랑스럽습니다.  정말 감사해요
Such a great show
1:59 I hope Hae Soo get to meet Jimmy Butler and Fallonl !😍
i haven't watched a single ep of this show.....
The show was pretty daunting in itself but the one thing that haunts me is how it's about how far ppl with money are willing to go for entertainment and how relevant already is and could become in years to come.
I can feel how much Jimmy has prepared for this interview.
where's Ali
This was so awkward
does jimmy even know how to talk properly, he stutters so much it seems kinda overreacting
Koreans have really poor English for a fairly "developed" Country.
뭐야 언제나온거야 대박...ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I love globalization 🌎
I am not a cry baby..my tears don't drop easily but this series drained my soul.  Damn.. what a seri(es)!
Jimmy Fallon your so fake
I just came here to hear them speak English lol
ye~
Sad and Strange
Korean invasion!!!
I’m such a big fan
Выживание это главное для человека. Поэтому сериал такой популярный 👍🏼
THE SECOND GUY NEXT TO GI HUN REMINDS ME OF TAEHYUNG.
Jimmy: "I'm not giving any spoilers tonight" Also Jimmy: *literally spoils the first game*
“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God For not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16-18‬
Squid Game is the Gangnam Style of 2021!
how does Jimmy know what they're saying?!!
why did he keep calling Hajoon Hajin TT couldn't somebody from the crew tell him TT
they all fine as HELL. 🥵
캬 국뽕이 차오른다아아
Hae-soo omg he's so attractive I was rooting for him until the end no matter what 😍
BABY SQUID I LOVE IT
one thing i really love about jimmy is that he does proper research before inviting the guests over, not to mention he's so respectful, and treats his asian guests so nicely (contrary to some american or late night show hosts, you know the names)
Wait i dont remember the scene where the man bumps on saebyeok and spilled her coffee ??
Is it just me who can’t see the square?
한국의 오징어게임 팀들 완전 자랑스럽다❤

jimmy thanks for doing this. waaahhh love this
the fact that I always was the weird girl in class for watching K dramas and now everyone is watching it TT
Mukha ngang mga squid sila
Ali should be in these interviews too
They should have also invited Ali,ji-yeong and ll-nam.But I love the interview <3.
Ngl this whole interview was akward as hell
..... 자랑스럽다 외국 방송에 한국인 나오네
무궁화꽃이 피었습니다 게임은 지금도 아이들이 즐겨하는 게임.줄다리기는 운동회 필수종목이죠.흔한 우리 애들 놀이로 멋진 드라마 만들었네요~
I’m waiting for season 2 😩😩
위하준..너무 잘생겼어ㅠ
Such a good series!
수양대군이 이렇게 순해질줄이야
Chinese is using their money to make western audiences to forcefully consume their media which is only bringing awkwardness and backlashes. In the meanwhile, S.Korea hasn’t spent a single penny to export their contents, but their local contents spontaneously became viral purely due to their ability and creativity.
If you like to see more Lee Jung Jae's acting, 'New world' 2012 can be a good choice.
Put BTS in Squid game 2 and everyone will be BLOWN AWAY......🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
leejungjae😭baby
jokes aside this show shouldnt be watched by kids..there are perverted dark scenes  aside from killing part of course
Gi hun is so so so so so so
Ya know what’s funny, I’ve seen Squid game compared to Danganronpa.   Now if you haven’t heard of Danganronpa, it’s originally a Japanese video game but has its own anime (I like the game more), in which you are the main character that gets stuck in a murder mystery killing game with 15 other of the most talented high school students in all of Japan. Personally it’s a masterpiece, squid game is different in the fact that there is no mystery behind which person has murdered another, it’s blatantly and painfully obvious, in Danganronpa you have people who you think are pure kids maybe even friends, but must go out of their way to plot the perfect unsolvable murder in hopes of being the only one to escape. As the main character, it’s your job to figure out “whodunnit?” But you’re also finding clues and having a class trial with the killer among you the entire time. It also has the most unpredictable sensical plot twists. Murder, deception, mystery, betrayal. In these ways thing like Squid game and Danganronpa intrigue us. It’s human nature but these terrible acts are, entertaining? They’re so cruel, yet we can’t pull our eyes away.
진짜 대박났네 쩐다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
God I hate Jimmy Kimmel so much. But the cast really is lovely
Jimmy said no spoilers after giving away red light green light 😂🤦🏾‍♀️
It feels like everyone has watched squid game✨  (Not a bad thing at all just my opinion)
Freaky movie
I used to play some of these games when I was little but it was shocking to see them with a twist. Well made show...love the actors.
genioss
uff
I'm not gay: but the dude in red can rail the living shit out of me.
Divinos mis nenes 💘💘
Jimmy is so bad at interviewing guests. What kind of weak questions were tht and reactions
I thought she kept her hard down because she was ashamed to steal from him😄
Squid game is really a one of a kind
I never thought a voiced over show would be so good
that girl is absoullty gorgoues!!!....however this show is a warning off how things in our world can end up like this, if not things like this already happen .....hint hint, just look around
I really wish il - nam came here as well , it would’ve been so wholesome to see him. I also wish ali was in this episode too! It would’ve been so much fun.
어색하게 영어 안쓰고 한국말 인터뷰라니 개쩔어 버렸다 배우분들 멋져요 👏
💜💜💜💜💜💜
I love that Jimmy Fallon supports Korean artists
Nice
squid game really deserves its fame and achievements the show's getting now!
Queen Ho Yeon Jung 🥰🥰
Jungjae is 48 years old! Dude he looks young as hell
Im proud as asian
There’s a robot that turns around and shoots people. No spoilers, not giving any spoilers tonight…
Although I am Korean, I don't like them humanly. Their personal behavior is really sucky. Korea is sensitive to exposure to privacy, but their background is well known as dirty except rookies 'sang-woo' and 'ha-joon'
이정재 수트핏 전세계 사람 알게되서 좋다
They really just went and cut my husbands face out at the end of the teaser clip. He’s the whole selling factor!
I really like squid game bcoz it's not like typical kdrama which includes love stories
This presenter is really cringe! He seemed so fake!
Notice how she’s the only one who speaks english.. yes I brag about my gender a lil bit thank you
On my opinion, I believe squid game became this popular because of tiktok. Thank to them
Geez they're all so gorgeous
Jimmy youve been in this business way to long to be stumbling on your words during interviews
Now that's what I nedded
It all started with BLACKPINK respect...
Why didn’t they have Ali come on this interview ☹️
I think they should have invited Anupam Tripathi, Gong Yoo and Lee Yo-Mi too!! Anyways loved it! <3
I am continually disappointed by drama shows and generally prefer movies. However, I’m up to episode 6 of this and am absolutely gripped by it. The marble episode was just heartbreaking and the characters are simply fantastic.
I watch it last night  It is cool !!!
자막줘
So he let a spoiler out regarding the end of the first episode....nice one Jimmy
Each one of them worked really hard and had a lot of trouble in their lives so they fit their characters perfectly.
mas wiwi cekek gue sekarang. PPALI JEBAL ANYING
Y’all shoulda brought the old man too 😭
Yeah, its a funny and interesting drama nowadays😂
Give me ypir skin care routine please
I'm a Korean. Chulsoo is like Jack and Younghee is like Jill. FYI
Jimmy is kinda awkward lmao
‘who is this psycho robot?’ HAAHAHAHHAHA
HELP THEY LOOK UNCOMFORTABLE 😀
i love them
내가 어렸을때 하던 놀이가 30년 40년이 지나 전 세계에 알려진게 너무 신기하다 태어날때는 후진국이었는데 지금은 선진국이 됐지 아 오늘은 한글날입니다!
where is gong yoo??😍😍😍😍
they are so darn humble, humile and modest, i am melting!
WFT Jimmy! You just completely ignored the girl!!
이제 연예인들이 영어배워야 하는 건..필수구나..,
한국어 자막좀ㅜㅠㅎ
They are so humble
They couldn’t get the pakistanian dude? 😭 his death was 100 times more painful than anyone else’s 😭
Disliked. He skipped Hoyeon a bit which bothered me. Also wtf with spoiling one of the most nerve wracking scenes in the movie? 🤦‍♀️ I am glad I didn't stumble upon this video before watching the series.
They can understand English? But just cant reply????
오징어게임 최고~~
This show is winning an Emmy! No doubt!
Red light, green light was also played back in therapy in Germany. It was called “who’s afraid of the black man”. Not a good look.
this show seems way overrated & dumb
Glad to see the 4 of u 😍 but it would be nice if you also include 001 and Ali 🙏
how do they know what each other are saying
Ang gwapooo naman ng mga oppa ko!!!!😅🤪😍😍😍😍😍😍
So Squid Games was a hit in America. The Guy slapping the guy in the train station is the most handsome.
Bro, why does this interview make me so happy and somewhat emotional?
Boy do i cannot stand J Fallon
Legend members
아니 이사람들이 여기 왜 나와?!! 와 인기가 있긴 있구나
I Fucking LOVE SQUID Game
자랑스럽다 대한한국 ♡
yas they're amazing
Wow 😍😍😍😍😍
I despise jimmy
Why wasn't Ali a part of this :c
That show was the shit!
I haven’t watched Squid Game yet but these four people are so attractive, oh my god
Jimmy doesn't understand what they first said so  Jimmy : it's frightening ,thrilling 😂
이정재 실제로 영어 잘하는데 한국어 하는거 발린다..
Ah yes freemasons number 1
Ali didn't deserve Tat😔
You had a personal question for all but the female cast. Maybe cut, maybe intentional,  we may never know.
awwww it’s so cute how haesoo became a father 10 minutes before the premiere of squid game :( he’s the cutest father
Interview aside, I'm so PROUD of all the actors here have gotten the recognition they deserve! They are all so freaking talented and I hope that they go on to do more amazing projects for years to come <3
I lowkey wish they let Korean American actors host shows where they interview Korean guests. I feel like the conversations would flow more naturally. For example, he asks them questions but doesn't really build on what their saying. It's like an awkward pause and they move on to another question
squid game is number 1 in my country
Park hae so is so 🥵
You're telling that this is better than alice in boderland?
Ya Allah..  Siapa sangka mereka jadi bintang tamu di the tonight show Jimmy Fallon
WHY ISNT ALI EVER IN THESE INTERVIEWS!!!!!!!
jimmy always have to act funny or laugh makes me dislike him
🕺🕺https://youtube.com/channel/UCpHKcrv2po41pLR4PzRkkKQ🕺🔥
I am a big fan of kpop and kdramas and now I feel like it gets the recognition it deserves
thanks  Jimmy Fallon ..u r the best anchor ever in history
Where is Ali?
For some reason there was this awkward tension i felt through out the show.
Less than a minute it 😦 that chars was not charming no friendly. He was a lazy prick that forgot his daughter’s birthday then stolen money from his sick mother
This is the first time I have watched this guy and it’s shocking how absolutely terrible he is at not just interviewing, but also formulating his thoughts and communicating in a genuine way. This guy has his own talk show? Wow
One of those people were in prison break it is a good prison show
The actor who play old man and Ali should also get invited on shows... I mean they're great actors and deserves more ✌️
와 호연양 영어도 잘하네
Love the show
4:51 fake laugh
와 인생은 한방이닼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 순식간에 미국 토크쇼에 나오넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
No spoilers today guys!  Like 30 seconds later:  I want to show you guys a clip of squid game-
They understand English?
That young lady is cute
I think, final winner is 'Netflix'. All of the world, youtube, news, tiktok..etc talking about Squid Game.
Jimmy “no spoilers”. But a minute before spoiled the big twist in episode 1 with the doll lol
Why didnt he ask the woman any questions?!?!?!?!?!?! Pathetic
Bitcoin+Dogecoin buy buy
The stupid quart literally sparkle because colt electronmicroscopically announce following a spiritual castanet. eager, malicious vault
if y’all want to watch something like this show give Alice in Borderland a chance. Not to say a big word but it’s better. (sorry not sorry i did not like squid game at all. no hate to the actors, though)
Haesoo is so fine wtf
아쉽게 배우들이 겁나 말을 못하네 ㅋㅋㅋ 봉준호랑 달라...
4:50 Jimmy’s fake laugh is just great 🤣
ZERO digital special effects. To the haters of too many special effects, or you won't watch another second (!) check this show out!
Feel bad for the actors this interview was horrible
Still waiting for season 2 This series is amazing 🔥🔥🔥
i love this💗💗
직접 가서 했으면 더 좋았을텐데 살짝 아쉽네요 ㅠㅠ 그래도 오징어게임이 인기가 많아서 오징어게임 팬으로써 너무 뿌듯하고 기분이 좋네요 ㅎㅎ
I cant lie, i wish someone better was interviewing them
2:45 jojo reference :)
I love this kdrama
do u know BTS? do u know Black Pink? do u know Parasite? do u know Squid Game?
This show was sooo good!!! I enjoyed ever minute of it...  and it doesn't hurt that the actor that plays the cop is so fine😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰
why was jimmy so nervous and awkward
뭐라는겨
Says what happens in the most shocking scene of the show, then says "no spoilers".. right
0:56 Korean keanu reevees
Where is Ali
Why the FUCK did they put the subtitles upside GODDAMNNN. Lemme see their damn faces
Koreans' are taking over hollywood...
I hate how it’s so over hyped now. Ive seen it already but the internet just loves to make things more and more uninteresting
Wow squid game famous wooooooooooo
Lee jung jae was born in 1972 Park hae soo in 1981 Ha jun in 1991 Ho yeon in 1994
WHERES ALI!!!!
이정재 존나 잘생겼다
Just waiting for Il-Nam to appear in atleast one interview :)
The X is missing from the PlayStation logo 😂😜
So proud to see so many Asian faces on American TV/Film this yeah. Praying for more POC representation in the future
They should‘ve invited the actor for ali and the other girl 240 as well 🥺🥺🥺
하지만
this was so painful to watch, jimmy is so awkward 😭
Saya indonesia sendiri
MY FELLOW KOREAN ICONS seriously so proud of the recognition my people continue to get in the entertainment industry
ten years later...
baby squid😭
I love the cast, but bc of Jimmy everything feels awkward and uncomfortable 😭😭😭
Every time jimmy starts frantically laughing, the cast is looking at him like "just nod and smile y'all"
His pants are too short
15 years ago I never thought this could happen where actors and artists from other countries get to share their work in the west and be greeted in a non-ignorant, open way :) It's a great feeling
Sucesso! Wow!!
They look like they’re having so much fun, congratulations 🎉
이정재 존나 골져스하다..
Time to learn korean lol
Laugh faker than ali's partner trust
Me being out of the loop about it: * Immediately watches this *
Well second season most likely won't be good this show was 1 season banger
I almost was expecting him to speak in English 😭😭
Jimmy's fake laugh... Effortless
Hajoon is so attractive gahd damn
The guy who played the cop is so HOT!!! #aminlove
Let’s just realize our own govt is currently playing red light green light with all of us
South Koreans are ruling the entertainment world without a need to learn English. Now that's something!
3:44
Jimmy fallon's fake laugh be like: 🤣🤣😆😆🤣🤣
"No spoilers" *Proceeds to show a tiny spolier*
The alive nurse jelly disapprove because consonant ecologically recognise along a adaptable price. intelligent,  flagrant elephant
199 is still missing
great actors man, no cap
Disney made so many Marvel series but it didn't create a big impact really. Then Netflix just one movie it made me forget about all the Marvel and Disney had done.
🙋‍♂️😄💕👍
Bring aliii
BRINGG ALIIII
I memorise the squid game the doll songs
자동 번역 깔끔한데ㅋ
오징어게임 최고. 한국배우들 최고. 지미팰런쇼 최고ㅋㅋ
I’m so angry that saebyeok didn’t get screen time 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Worth the hype
I’m 12 and the only scene that made me uncomfortable was when someone put the needle in the main character’s nostril, is it just me? Lol
This is the best series i ever seen
If you like "Squid Game", you must see "The Wailing" and "Train to Busan"
Anyone knows the name of song at 6:10???
love it~~
I don’t understand his introduction to the first guest. The man was not like-able or loveable. He stole from his own mother, was a lazy leech, and a terrible father!! Why were people rooting for this man !? Is it because he’s like you guys?
Unfortunate he didn’t acknowledge the lady much.
You can tell Jimmy did not watch the show, the main character is kind of the biggest jerk ever.
Squid Game is the next Gangnam style. Every white person thinking they know Korea because of a single thing. Lmao. Shit thags been going on for like 15yrs already.
OMGGGGGGGG YESSSSSSSSS OMLLL I LOVE THISSSSS
It's a battle royal money prized game
I'm still shocked that  jung ho-yeon (sae-byeok) is his first time acting
Im in love with Sae Byoek
On a scale of bad to bad how bad is jimmy’s pronunciation of the casts name😂
The Italian government and the Vietnamese government have accused Netflix of tax evasion! So we will never let Netflix, a large tax evasion company, enter our country !
I just got so cringed after Jimmy’s laugh.
I'm calling it now. Squid Game is this decade Game of Throne.
If most Korean actors are be able to speak English well, it will be Perfect
nice fake laugh jimmy
hoyeons english is so good!!!
🤍
Felix+Ni-ki=ho yeon
I am worried about Season 2. The more I expect, the more disappointing.
parkey su 😭
Squid game is the overrated series seriously.. they can put more cool games like hide and seek, musical chairs, tap etc or Indian game like " chidiya udd" .. and I don't know why it get so much attention..
MY HOUSE CONTAINER https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PX1Msrp2NA , ,,, ,,,, , ,,, ,, ,, ,,,, , ,, ,,,,
Man this show was so good. Haven’t seen anything this good in a while
Stan Aespa
We reley tahank you neflix if squid game have a nader video i see evry time
ㅈㄴ 신기하네..
My favourite here in the squid game in season 1 it’s probably the honeycomb cookies it makes me wanna eat something
Sae Byeok is so pretty 😍😍😍
Wi Ha Jun is so fineeeeeeeee !!!
After penthouse,squid game made us  more crazy about k drama
Jimmy never fails to make me feel uncomfortable...
Anyone knows the voice of the woman giving instructions during the game ? Who is she ?
These types of shows are for psychopaths. How can people watch these and not get disturbed
Just imagined how awkward the raw and unedited clip was.
이정재 얼굴보고 들어왔더니 외국인이 나와서 놀랬네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
wtf how can Jung-Jae Lee be 48 years old 😵
Hollywood wishes it could make shows like this now. PC culture has destroyed the U.S. film industry.
유명 배우들이 영어를 못하노... 좀 쪽팔린다야ㅠ 한국은 지금 문징어 게임으로 인해 서민들 학살중ㅜㅜ

If you are new to kdramas like Squid Game, there are so many more to discover. They may be different from each other but they are all excellently written, acted, directed and produced. Squid Game was a bit intense for some people (me included) but another kdrama currently airing is Hometown Cha Cha Cha which is delightful to watch as well. Some other recent shows to consider watching are; Vincenzo, It's Okay To Not Be Okay, Itaewon Class, Crash Landing On You and Hospital Playlist. I can make an argument that South Korean TV and Film is the best in the world right now. At the very least there is so much good stuff to discover.
My little heart can’t handle this they’re all so cute and attractive i 😭😭😭😭😭
The woman is a dime
외국 영상인데 배우들이 다 한국말로 말해서 보기 편하네요 ㅋㅋ
I SHIP HOYEON AND HAJOON BYE
Valió madres los subtítulos
I wish even Anupam (Ali) was invited he was also a major character along with the old man
About time a Korean show got recognition. Their directors are hella talented
They should have some interviews with Ali’s character ngl
Jimmy must be Tom Holland's brother they both have a genetic defect that makes them vomit spoilers
Jimmy just spoiled it for everyone who hasn't watched the show 🤦‍♂️  "I'm not giving any spoilers"   "oh everyone gets shot in the first game by creepy doll"
Forced laughs and gags
Korean tsunami repping that east Asian oh yeah!
LJJ is almost 50yo lol
3:25 what type of bad show is this fake laughing for what
It’s so refreshing to see intelligent and talented actors care about the material. Props to Hwang Dong-hyuk for sticking by his idea.  In other news, I really don’t like American media 😂 - audience laughter, the fake reactions; I can already see the theme park being built. 🙃
Damn the girl can pick my pocket anytime she wants
Kerala(കേരളം)-India  Squid game❤️
4:51 what a fake laugh. Why are those American late night show hosts so fake ?
Of course… we have jimmy jumping on the band wagon 🤦🏻‍♂️
They make me feel like a proud Korean citizen 🤦🏼‍♀️ and I’m latina.
Let the girl talk wtf ?
My friends who make fun of me for watching kdramas everytime But  now they are watching squid game with me 🤣😌 Bro it's also a kdrama 😌😌💜
가슴이 웅장해진다!
where is ali????????
Me who watched alice in borderland ..... This kinda gives the same feeling.
I played green light, red light when I was little, now Im 15. We played it here in Croatia and its called "Drvena Marija"- which means wooden Maria
He didn’t even ask Hoyeon Jung a question..
What made me sad only Gihun probably will be in Squid Game S2..whiles others dont..unlucky since all these cast are super popular right now 😓
Not the fake laugh after he told a SCENE THAT DIDNT MAKE IT and hes like i remember that😅😅😜
Godbless y'all! God always loves you he is also always with you! Have a nice day! Stay safe and healthy! If ur under pressure God is always there with you! I hope u acheive ur dreams ! ✝😇❤
Minus Tripathi "Ali" Anupham
Where is ali😡😡😡😡😡
4:53 that laugh was so fake 😭
where is ali?
He should've invited Ali.. they all are incredible
Squid game number one Trends in Lebanon 🇱🇧❤🇰🇷
1:47- istg he sounds like taehyung-
Yayyuuu 💛💛💛♥️
👍👍👍👍👍
Hoyeon is just pure talent I love her so much 😭
no spoilers except for the red light green light lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤️️
His fake laughs still haven't changed
She’s going to d13d in the end.
i got a squid game ad before this
Lee Jung Jae played a lot of villian roles? What?
"Ggrr"
Where is toilet girl?
Trust this man to not breathe a word about the underlying class commentary that drives the plot.  Acknowledging it might piss off the elite that Fallon salivates over
I'm in heaven seeing actors I've loved for awhile finally getting their day in the sun on American shows.  My mind can't handle the hallyu wave that's about to takeover the nonbelievers!
We need more Ho-yeon
자랑스럽다 우리나라 배우들..!!!
Yeah I ended the season in one day 🙄.
Why you didn't bring our boy, Ali?
OH HELL NAH 3:05
Everytime I see the squid game symbols it low-key bothers me there's no X.
I never watched a korean serie before but when squid game started to get so much trending i decided to give it a watch and tbh they really worked so hard on it and also out of the serie they are all so nice ahh i love them
국뽕
Man the only Koreans Jimmy is real with are BTS
I just finish it now and it is really good movie
"Is the grr"
The story has a good drama, but the ending was kinda awful
whoever turned down this show for the last 10 years must feel so dumb right now lol
I watched this drama but I never felt this drama is so good. I am big fan of k-dramas and I watched countless dramas in my life but I never feel that Korean culture and family values vibe in this drama.
한글~ 생일 축카해~
Gotta be the quickest one to climb the ladder.
Jimmy literally just ignored the female cast.
Why do american people watch a show with a host that is SO fake and forced? It’s cringy as fuck, doesn’t it make you wanna slap that face all day long? I don’t know how y’all manage with this show…😪
Hopefully people will check out South Korean cinema also . Which is excellent
생각보다 질문이 식상하다  좀색다른걸 기대했는데
지미횽, 월드스타 앞이라 말 더듬고 떠는교?
I watched squid games for jung ho yeon but the plot bro~~
Jim reminds me of the hunger games show host guy who is talking to them
Waiting to see indian stars there ❣️❣️❣️
한국어로 얘기해주는거 너무좋다
This was so hard to watch lmao
My daughter told me about it first, suggesting that I should watch it. She loves to scare her momma silly! She is the one who also suggested that I watch precious,  another scary buy informative movie staring the ever so talented Monique and Gabourey Sidibe! I love them!🥰
04:52 why can't  improve his fake laugh , how many years is he in this show business??
Ali should be in the interview not the police man 😏
They’re not dead ☠️ 👀 it was all fakee
i enjoyed watching it and it makes me realize kindness always win
:O
I don’t think jimmy has been any more awkward with any other guest, maybe it was cuz he was nervous about asking the wrong questions since people on twitter were makinh fun of the questions american media ask asian actors
It was very informative and scary for me! 😃💯👍🏾
Too much spoiler!!!
before they were acting so weird towards kpop, kdrama but I'm glad something normal like that finally got normalized
오징어게임 방탄소년단 대한민국 자랑 감사합니다
This is the GAP between SOUTH KOREA and CHINA. We are not speaking loudly, frivolously, annoyingly, but gently. Please don't say "Nihao" to Korean. HaHa
I want to see Chulsoo in Season 2
Where is Ali? You did not bring the best part of the cast
“Right now” 🤣😂
I am surprised they don’t speak English that’s the minimum of knowledge specially in Asia
Primero idols y ahora actores coreanos. Corea está arrasando con el entretenimiento en todo el mundo <3
Wi hajoon is such a wonderful man i cant even express my love for him
ㅠㅇㅠ 한국어 자막 만들어줘요. 영어를 못해서 지미펠런님 위트있는 진행이라고 다른분들이 리뷰해주셨는데 무슨 말인지 궁금해요ㅠ
Its kind of funny netflix is being fine for the show being too popular.. i mean cmon its an amazing show the acting is brilliant even for the non main characters and adding jazz music to it makes it i dunno a bit more creepy in a psychotic way.. it deserves to be number 1 in many countries
It made me cry 😭 https://youtu.be/iqVrvHoUmIo
What is Aliiiii????????
Wi ha joon❤️❤️❤️
🤡🤡Squid game
Wow!! Amazing! Very nice Squid game and Jimmy Fallon Show 👍🏻👍🏻
You need to watch (the guest) , sweet home ,
Korea is God right now
한국어로 인터뷰하고 영어자막 나오는거 뿌-듯🦑
Bro this host asked nothing. Terrible.
This show is trash omg im from italy and i see this crap like an a stereotype of americans
God Jimmy is the most fake unlikeable person ever
i love jimmy but what the heck was that laugh
놀랍다!!!
Loved Squid Game too much
This show is sooooo good!!
dude i wish this kinda love existed for shows like Kaiji or Alice in Borderland. Not negating the popularity of squid game at all, I thought the show was amazing. Just, still. ya know? After being a consumer of so much eastern media, I wish some of my favorite shows would get recognition.
i like hae soo he lit
ok but does jimmy even know what theyre saying
We needed Ali as a member of the cast too!
Imaginative plotting and memorable characters make me happy.
turkiyeden s elamlarrr
they are the only characters i really fell in love with in squid game and they are my favorites what a coincidence that they all end up in one interviewwwwww
4:29 the way Gihoon pronounce "Cofffffee" ✨ C L A S S ✨
Where’s ali??
We use to play this game all the time growing up in India!!! We called it "Statue/ Freeze" ... Watching them play this in Squid games hit me hard with nostalgia 😩
아진짜 이정재 존잘~~~~~~~~~
Wiwiwi Hajoon-ssi.... 🤍🤍🤍
Where is the actor of Ali in all these interviews
I hope this kind of webcam interviews will continue even after the pandemic. It opens up as to who can guest on talk shows. Same with the pre recorded musical guests.
Its Wi Ha Joon not Wi Han Joon
I love Hae Soo,s "right now" and calling Jimmy "Jimmy Brother" so cute!
Sang-Woo did nothing wrong
Why cant we get the WHOLE of Squid game's cast for once?? BTW Such a wholesome cast!
Thank you Jimmy for interviewing squid game actors and actress!
Why he always lookin down like he alil kid trynna explain to his mama why he did somethin bad -.-
Considering how brilliant the show is I’m sure he could have thought of more interesting questions
This show deserves at least one Emmy.
I absolutely 💯 loved this show..sooo good!!!
me searching the old man and ali:
Jimmy, he would be really shocked if he knew he is a real villain in his real life. LOL
If u meet them i ask *me*can i join squid game season 2*
Sorry but Jimmy Fallon is pretty annoying. What's with the fake laughs? It's a bit disrespectful lol.
Appreciation for all cast and crew of squid game 👏👏👏👏
squid game catapulted them to instant superstar.. damn!! ❤❤ love them.. Squid Game is damn incredible
Imma need to know what these people be eating, applying on their face and just doing!!! They're all stunning AF 😳
nice acting Jimmy😒👹
Lee jung jae is so handsome here
Jimmy Kimmel is cringy and Fake af
Bored bored bored...
WTF THIS INTERVIEW?!?? ezzz
Jimmy is the best host ever 😂
I finally gave the show a chance it’s really amazing by far.
KOE-REE-ANNE 🐟
Why is it korean are best for doing this kind of show..sane with the japanese..
X O ∆ 3619
Too bad that he ignored the actress even when she was willing to speak in English. Bad manners
扯
Jimmy says he’s not giving spoilers after already giving spoilers lol. Luckily I’m smart enough to watch a full series before I watch any content about it
ㅛㄷㄴ냑
K dramas are awesome 👏 they deserve more recognition along with K Pop!
The K-entertainment industry is wildin! World domination of kdramas/kpop 😍🥰
WHERE ALİ ?
i would really be happier if player 1 guests here
W
why is he stuttering
it bigger than- then change the subject lol is this your first time hosting or?
Someone: What’s your sexual orientation? Me: *Shows the cast members*
I got the main soundtrack be my ringtone!
Sae beok ultimate gir crush
Jimmy Fallon is actually one of the nicest interviewers in American reality tv. He might giggle and laugh a bit much but he’s far better than other interviewers with their foot-in-the-mouth way of interviewing (esp their non-american/non-english speaking guests) :)
Squid game is one of the best TV series I ever see man the  cast story all spot on 👌👌👌👌👌😘
Jimmy and his fake laugh demands an episode of its own!!!
한국말이 괜히 반가움 ㅜㅜㅜ
im so happy for them
“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭God bless
worst interview ever. barely lets them speak and has mediocre questions...
The guy that is sang woo he  is actually really kind irl
지미팰런 쇼 화이팅! (Feat. 한글날)
im so proud of them all
ty for squid game ...ty jimmy fallon... ty actors <3 and peace
where is ali
Where’s Ali
Ali should be there
I am so happy that the biggest show isn't American. I like that about Netflix.
Where's our star Ali?
He should have asked question from the actress 😬😬😬 she is so cute ❤️❤️❤️
Holy sheet. I bet none of them would’ve expected this show to go this big. First two especially are amazing/experienced actors and I’m surprised at this moment.  And please, if there is anyone who hasn’t watched squid game in SUB, then go and do so. If the translation is not accurate in anyways, experience the vibe at least.
They have smuch fun😍❤️
It's funny how Sae pronounces girl as "girr"
wowwwww!!!
am telling yall, this thing is everywhere -.-
She's gorgeous 😍 💖
Sae Byeok aka Hoyeon Jung is Love 😍
The Sheep Game
5:00 ㄹㅇ?? 첨알았는데.. 축하드립니다
This is awkward
That was just disrespectfull to the girl, no questions to her, really?
I can't believe that korean movies have developed this much!!
I love Gi hun
I've actually played these games as a kid, they aren't just famous in Korea. Green light red light, tug of war, marbles. The only one I've never heard of was Squid game :D ofc we played these games as a kid without the shots 😳✊🏻
I have watched a lot of K-drama in the past 2 years and everyone was like,  noooo how can you like this, the language, the other culture? And now Squid Game is trending,  I'm so proud❤ I love the actors and the serie is really really good!
Jimmy said "show's bigger than-" i wonder what he was going to say
I wish Ali was there ...
The actor who plays the cop is so fine 😍😍
I love the Way Jimmy Says There Name!
papa Mochi!
Wowowwww
When we were young we played the games in <Squid Game>, and I've never thought about how 철수 영희 looked at that time.. But now days when foreigners talk about the crazy doll.. I'm like kind of feeling sad.. she was not supposed to be mean character.. she was helping kids learn standard things.. like school rules, how we build a friendship... or something like these... poor 영희 😭
did lee jung jae really played a lot of villain roles? i thought he always played leading man. Il Mare is one of my favorite Korean film.
I love all of them so much omgggg
the only person who can speak english in the panel doesnt get any direct question… she said like one sentence. how disappointing
Really? A Skype interview
Do more research though. Lee Jung-jae doesn't "mostly play villains in movies", dude is basically a legend in Korea. This is like saying to Keanu Reeves "I know you mostly play villains" - da fk u talking about?
This made me so happy
🎉🎉🎉💜💜
as much as i love these interviews, i really wish they included the person who plays Ali aka Anupam Tripathi  as well , as he  did an amazing job as well
Jimmy butchering the krap out of their names but love the promoting of Korean stuff lately on his show
Finally korean dramas are getting what they deserve 👏🏻
That’s laugh at 4:54 was the fakes shit I ever heard in my entire whole life..
So the origin isn't the daruma game from kamisama no iutoori?
Will there be a second season?!
She's so pretty~
I think the actors are paradoxical in a way in that they dress up too fancy and fold their knees as if they are being 'actors'  at the same time they are talking about all the setious problems in the world. Division of wealth and etc. I have always thought this. Can't they be more thoughtful when discussing serious social problems. They just look like attention seeking 'star' wannabes
One of the best shows if not the best show to come out in 2021
Should have had the guy with face tattoo too.
If Hoyeong Chung likes men who cook I'm finna go all the way to Hells Kitchen🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
"Hae soo you became a dad when the squid premiered right?"  Yeah cos he became everyone's daddeh 🤤
Corean Man are so attractive😍
I wish they come over to US
I love it because it gives you a lesson in the end makes you think about us humans they did a good job 👏 👍
Him spelling their names correctly *amazed*!
Jung hoyeon
bro Sae-Byeok is the reason why I am into Asian women now
*Jesus Christ loves you and cares for you have a good day everyone*
Where is the Pakistani guy and the main villain and the cunning woman they had a huge role too
Just saw this last week. Many people were talking about this show and told me about it...yeah yeah..so I was on Netflix looking for something to watch and saw the thumbnail and was like...hmmm? I saw the trailer and was very interested and saw the first episode and was SOLD! I watched the whole thing and was like...DAMN!!! Finally some good shit to watch. Very creative and just loved the series and was invested in all the characters even the bad ones. Then realized this show is freaking huge and I can see why. I want to see more. This year in entertainment is good since the pandemic as now today we are getting new fun shows movies etc. Hell soon we'll get Cobra Kai S4, New Star Wars stuff on Disney, etc. Great video! A+++
W cast
Jimmy is such a shit interviewer
So akward conversation Jimmy!, 😶
As a die hard fan of KOREAN SHOWS since foreverrrr this makes me so happy seeing them blow up. I’m crying! FIGHTING💕
Bro she is bad😍 Michael Jackson remember the time, Liberian girl Bad ❤️(Korean version tho)
The best!!
I was  really  surprised  that  so  many  global  people really  like the  squid  game even if they  dont  know  korean language (of course it  have subtitle) and also   the  games  in  squid  game  were  not  familiar  to  them  when  some  one  asked  what  do  u think  when  u  heard  about  the  country  korea, most of  them  said  Samsung  bts  but  now  Squid game  lol
Is it me or did this whole interview seem ackward? From Jimmy's perspective. Not the cast. It just seemed like everything he did didn't seem genuine, OR, he had to keep himself together and 'act the part' during his show as he tried to be courteous to the cast. And yes, I did see him rarely ask Ho-Yeon anything.
wait i thought 3 of them are dead.
Good to see other countries work is recognized & appreciated at tonight's show👍🏻
Nice 👍
This show will unite the world
Jimmy Fallon is the sweetest host ever 💜
love it!!!
PSY >  BTS > Parasite > Squid Game !   This is awesome Korea !
Why Anupam tripathi is not in any interviews?
Interesting wardrobe shift compared to their Korean reviews.
Damn, why is he so fake?
When I finished watching it I knew it would climb to number 1
I never understand why they dont show director or writer its like they no important
I wanna see that tatoo guy villian..where is he.. invite him
so good
Seeing the thumbnail, I can't find face difference
Best series ever !
where can i get wi ha-joon's sweater
N entendi nada mas concordo com tudo que a  Jung Ho-Yeon falou, DEUSAAS
국뽕 씨부레 ㅠㅠㅠ
Oh yeah.. really loved it!! ;))
한국인??
idk why but this interview made me realize how much i can’t stand jimmy fallon
Unpopular opinion: Alice in borderland deserved the recognition more than squid game.
Damn how can a girl look so beautiful like Sae Byeok
It’s like Ali doesn’t exist :| this is the second interview without him
Oh if you only knew the truth behind this satanic show. Its more real than you could imagine. There is a reason why this movie was hyped up. Jimmy Fallon knows the truth.
The husband of the doll is durama doll frome  as the gods will
이런 시팔 자막이라도 있어야 뭐라는지 알아먹던가하는디 자막이 없네
proud of u korea squid game well done❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
대한민국은 위대하다.  겸손과 진정성을 지닌 우리민족이 자랑스럽다. 한글로 쓰고 싶었습니다. 지미쇼도 최고의 토크쇼!!
Very proud of everyone behind the show including the cast, they did a great job and deserve every ounce of recognition
Where is Ali in all these ad campaigns??
I never watched the show and now I want to
Where is the 001 oldman?
생각보단 조회수가 안나오노.인기 있는 거 맞노?
Anupam Tripathi, an Indian is there... I'm so proud of him. I've been watching him for a long time on Sadia Rind's vlogs.
For some reason they look so different in real life
No more questions for Hoyeon?
I’m a little disappointed Ali isn’t here
Squid games = good  Jimmy Fallon = cornball butt puppet   🤷‍♂️
Where is Ali? :(
I really appreciate the show for using subtitles so they can feel more comfortable speaking their own language
Why can’t we have my boy Anupam Tripathi (Ali) also on the show?! His character was so pure! 😭
Ho-Yeon Jung is such a beautiful girl 🤗 I'm crushing on her not gonna lie 😍
Love etttt!!!!!Cant wait for S2!!!!!Come on guys?!WHEN IS IT?!🦑
I need the dub for this interview.
Korean actors don't care about English language, they are proud of their culture and language. They are independent & amazing actors. Indian actors should take note of that.
Omg it warms my heart to see Lee jung jae aka Lee jung Bae get more us attentiooonnn 💖💖💖
I love hae soo
Where is Ali
Kylie Jenner watch this👀
Congrats To Squid Game
instead of the police guy they should have brought Ali
WELL DESERVED!! THE SQUID GAME IS BY FAR ONE OF MY FAVORITES!!!
Nothing’s more plastic than fake laugh of Jimmy Fallon 😏
Biggest show just for now
jimmy has to be the worst interviewer
Korea is beating US in every way❤️❣️
American TV should take notice and stop being so woke otherwise they'll keep failing while Asian TV will continue flourishing more than it already is and become more popular globally.
Игра Массонов
K-dramas need to be more recognized in the US media because they produced some of the best script, best cinematography, and best actors/actresses, Most importantly, they don't use green screens unlike western shows.
i watched the show... 456 won... they can't speak english 3 men..the girl can..
No but how did he understand what theyre saying-? Were there a translator or???
I wish Ali and Ji young was here too
We love you! Thank u for this show.
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
I’m in LOVE with her shoes 😍
*മലയാളികൾ ഉണ്ടോ Squid Game ഫാൻസ്‌??*  *ചുമ്മാ* 🔥🔥🔥
1st saw Lee Jung-jae in Il Mare, he should have been more known for starring in the role that Hollywood remade - The Lakehouse. - wayback 2000, time flies.
💜🤍🇰🇷🤍💜 #kdrama
it was amazing
isn’t the red light, green light game based off the game we play in our childhood?
Ahh😫❤❤❤ amoo
Mi gr frend
Engrish please.
I wish Jimmy asked more questions to Hoyeon Jung :(( she felt kinda left out there
It makes me so warm that more and more ethnicities are so open to watching Asian/ Korean shows/dramas/movies! We are all one!
Jimmy: No spoilers guys even though I just told you what happens in the first game Red Light Green Light and the entire plot.  BRUH
Spoiler alert      I was so mad when I saw he was going back. ONLY ME?OK
<333
Yess my favorite series 🤩🤩
Fake laugh bro, I got cracked up by a fake lauh
내가 오징어게임 보려고 넷플 한 달 끊었다 후 시험 끝나자마자 보러 가야지
Well done Jimmy with the name pronunciation!!
I can’t with Jimmy’s exaggeration 😬😖🙄 he wasn’t like this when he was still on Late Night….
Who's watching before 10 million views?
I love how in the series Saebyeok was super quiet but irl she’s just really happy
지미팰런쇼에나온 탄이들보고 입덕했는데 또한국배우들까지.. 너무 자랑스럽네요💜💜
Why is Ali not there???
I’m confused how this interview worked does Jimmy know Korean or was it being translated to him or something
am I the only one who's sad they didn't bring Ali in as well ?!
Jesus Jimmy isn't funny at all...talk show hosts are terrible
Lee Jung-jae is amazing!! His performance is very impressive!
Jimmy has taken his overracting and fake laughing to a whole new level
To those people in the comment saying SPOILERS is stupid enough to not realize why they are watching this Video
He keeps stuttering
I was just starting to get sick of Netflixes old and outdated shows and movies and was thinking about closing my account and go to another platform, then boom, this show pops up, erasing my thoughts of closing my account.  LOL .... damn you Netflix.
It’s so great 😀
Hoyeong jung😩
Everyone in the comments typing their names like they didn’t just google the proper spelling. When we talk about this Show at work, characters are as follows; ‘The S** bag with the glasses’, ‘The old Man’, ‘Evil 🍆 gobbler’, ‘The thief Chick’, ‘Ali’, ‘The Thug’, etc.. if you watch the show you can put a face on all these. Much respect to the actors which did a remarkable Job. 9/10 in my book.
I’m gonna ask if the 2rd dude is the cop
Can't wait for season 2!!
Is it just me or the way Sangwoo says "Right now, yeah, right now" gives off literal Taehyung vibes?
i am in love with each and every single one of them absolutely no joke. but also how did they do translation in the show live?
The Fact that Lee Jung-jae is 49 and looks so young...
Two good men
This host is so bad
love them<33
The things I do for Squid Game. Jimmy Fallon is worse than flesh-eating bacteria but I will look at his face if it means I get to see the cast of Squid Game.
You MUst See Jang Tae Jun on "Chief of Staff"
💕🌈💫✨
First time we get to see Korean stars on a show hosted in America for a Korean show. Korea is breaking ground
ahhh
I really wanna see also the cast with Il nam and Ali. Where can I find interviews with them also?
Ali should have been here too!
Good soup🍲 🍜
Great show
Korean pride, so proud of my people!
Cocoa Kursi Tiang bendera
no ali no like
멋지다👍👍 해외사는 한인으로써 좋은 작품 감사합니다🙏
THEY ARE AWESOME!
How are they understanding each other's language?
I used to play that game with my friends when i was a kid in the Philippines. Of course nobody has a bullet or a doll that shoots you a bullet. It's a real person that turns his head.  But if somebody moves, you're out of the game. Haha. Was fun!!
Not me absolutely hating hae-soo even though what he did was in a show not real life 😐
Aw really wished they interviewed the actor who plays Ali as well! #episode6killedme lol
Ali should've been there too!
한국인이 보기에 일상적인 인터뷰 태도로 보이는데 저게 겸손하게 느껴지는거면  미국애들은 얼마나 호랑방탕하게 인터뷰를 한다는거야? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Ugh man...i wish Anupam tripathi was also there
one of the stupidest shows I've ever seen, come on. I mean the squid game.
Sang woo reminds me of aizen from bleach
If you fans of Squid Games haven’t seen OLD BOY, watch it! A Korean masterpiece
I can watch season 1 episode 1 like over and over again
HAESOO IS SOOO FINE FOR WHAT
She's like a Korean zandeya
I watched this series the whole night season one to 9 The series is so nice you don't get bored at all I'm waiting for season 2
i cant do this theyre literally the cutest
2:16 Di mo kame maloloko Darren Espanto
tried watching it, stopped at eps 6 cz it was too boring, but meh
🤔
just finished the whole drama couple days ago. when is season 2 😅😅
I love those Koreans they are delicious
Lol I am not going to give away any spoilers so let's show a clip of the ending of the first game... DOH!  /SLAP!!
i love them so much aahhh
Jimmy going nuts 1:30
싱기방기
What a nice cast
Jimmy is so annoying. He didn’t ask Jung Hoyeon anything???
Yes, Parasite has an Oscar awards but one thing this series got it better than Parasite was the characters are more relatable in their portrayal of financial struggles.
What connected us to Squid games is that…it’s so real and scary at the same time! This has to be happening somewhere in the world and we are so awaken to it 👀
I very loved it !!
Wait! Did I just hear Jimmy talking in Filipino? 5:51 is he saying "yeah baby squid, ang cute naman" HAHAHAH
I'm inlove with them
Jimmy: I’m not giving spoilers  Jimmy: they played red light green light and if you moved you got shot
this is one of those shows that are best to watch without watching the trailers, im glad i straight watched the show on netflix without watching the teaser or trailer and if i did, damn those trailers always contains spoilers and will ruin the suspense
https://youtu.be/kaxbzT4H1gw
https://youtu.be/Opw70NdUnzc
god what an amazing show
https://youtu.be/Pvm5Y1YBeyc
Y'all I watched Wi Ha Joon's latest movie "Midnight" were he plays the role of psychopath killer. His acting is Amazing! I recommend y'all to watch it.
https://youtu.be/kaxbzT4H1gw
Jimmy sucks lol
Sae Byeok: One is a boy Also Sae Byeok : And one's the *gr*

Love this!!! 🥰
Тот самый русский комм😌💋
“One is a boy and one is the grrr…” no no I’m not making fun of her. I just think it’s absolutely adorable. Major props to her for being bilingual.
I am legit freaked out from that doll.  Now I want one as a collector’s item.
wow~~squid game jjang~~~~~~~~!!!
Damn, love the show and mostly...   They played better together
Squid game is my show of the year.
THEYRE LITERALLY THE BEST
Hoyeon the only one to speak fluent English and Korean. Just saw the first few episodes pretty solid show. She's also a model.

우리 배우들 자랑스럽고! 너무멋있고!
I think the Korean language is such a beautiful language which also contributed to the success of the drama.
We Stan HoYeon 🥺
So proud of it!!! 💖

I thought Vincenzo was amazing. But Squid Game is definitely another level.
Player 218 🔥
Crap host

todos dan tanta ternura :3
아니 이게 대체 무슨일이냐..
We all know, Fallon practiced saying their names for the whole week lmao 😭
Theyre all so beautiful lmao
Where is Ali
so cute!! “one is a boy and one is a gurr”
Jimmy is so overreacting and the fake laughs skdjsjks
Hoyeon Jung is just stunning ❤️ well they’re all just gorgeous and so modest. Love them!
Y do i feel that jimmy is talking to a blank screen and they have edited the vdo on it
❤❤❤
That series had me laughing my head off because it's INSANE especially the marble game and the glass scenes marble game old ma  is about to "die" supposedly so he stands their with a sob story while his partner has his back towards him and the old creepy man says hey then gives him advice them POW I mean seriously for what??? 😂🤣😂 all because he lost? man bye lol the  the glass scene had me laughing in tears bcais ether dude that praying had the most highest confidence in the entire universe for a split sec did you see how God answered his prayers when the other dude fell right them he knew he was blessed he has smirk on his face boyyyy like hell yea then the way he jumped like a ninja to the other glass and stood down for a split sec in a pose as if to make sure the glass doesn't collapse under him 😂😂😂 but things like do do happen unfortunately amongst high ranking people peace
Amo
Jimmy: "People fighting for $$$" How are You Jimmy??, when a show or a singer have it big time $$, U have to present them in your show even if you doesnt Undersatand it ja / BTW very rude with Hoyeon Jung's
why would you spoil the first game and the rules..? it's supposed to be the  very first shocking element of the show
Yaaaaaaaaaay
와 자랑스럽네요 Korea 오늘은 한글날 !!
For those unfamiliar with Lee Jung-Jae, he would be the equivalent of Denzel Washington in America. The list of film and TV awards he's won is too long. Some of my favorite movies are City of the Rising Sun (which also stars Jung Woo-Sung who is another amazing actor), New World (my favorite Korean movie), Face Reader, and Assassination. Oh, and he's 48... Korean genes lol
As a massive K drama fan its so awesome to see them on Jommy Fallon! Even though I'm not Korean I've started picking up the language too😍
Squid  game 🦑 🔫 it’s crazy how popular this show has become. Other Korean gems you may enjoy - Kingdom, Parasite, Joint Security Area, Mr. Sunshine. 👌
I love how a lot of people are jumping on the kdrama/korean movies bandwagon now lol, been loving them for years now, the best imo 👌🏼
It makes me sad that jimmy barely talked to HoYeon Jung
Jimmy understands korean?
They all look so good!
한국인으로서 엄청 자랑스럽다.
do y'all agree Jimmy was nervous af?
I’m sorry but is it just me or jimmy is sort of faking his laugh? Just an observation. Sorry.
you should have invited Ali as well every interview is w/o so unfair
YESSSS
그래
Great cinema, food, sense of humor, music, dance ♡ *Seoul's got soul*
This dudes questions are so ass and uninteresting.
Seriously people should realize now that Korean makes the best stuffs! Bts, parasite, squid game? Damn!
Jimmy prepares to laugh 80% of the time and fake laughs the other 20% while being actually funny the remaining 0%
Jun ho brother won so that means It will be gi hun
Honestly this interview was kinda bad
I love 67
"Here's a 3 vowel name repeated 4 times in a different combination of letters!"  And y'all thought math was dumb
"Here's a 3 vowel name repeated 4 times in a different combination of letters!"  And you though math was dumb
Why didn’t he talk to Ho Yeon Jung?  He takes turns asking all 3 of the other actors questions, but he doesn’t ask her anything at all.  It’s like she wasn’t even there.
Fun fact no one will like this
The superb fall contrarily nail because centimeter globally inject since a free egypt. lonely, unadvised ocean
ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ 다들 너무 멋져요💕
they are so classy and also humble!! i love them so much <3 cant wait for season 2
Why didn’t you ask the female actor more questions?
She speaks English too🤌🤌😍 she so bad. I watched this show before the hype and before the trendy bullshit. When I followed her, she had only 360k followers!!! Incredible cast
This show and cast is phenomenal where’s season 2 at?
Korea’s entertainment industry is taking over the world. Parasite, Squid Game, BTS, Blackpink. I mean, they’re ontop of the world right now.
Omg, Fallon's fake laugh...i cringe every time. His unadulterated laughs are so rare now :(
They’re gorgeous. Their skin care needs to be shared lol
they deserve all the recognition and praises! Damn, i feel like crying
Jimmy spoiled the whole first game and later is like, no spoilers no spoilers tonight, like boi really.
amazing brooo"
재밋어용
Lee Jung-jae = don "the dragon" wilson
BEST SHOW OF THE YEAR
Gosh, these Korean actors sure are incredibly humble and charming. Edit: As a straight guy, I simply can't help but appreciate how incredibly handsome Ha-joon is.
I hate Jimmy's fake laugh
the past few years have been so great for the asian community. feels so good to have asian shows, movies, music of all kinds be so popular and have so much exposure
Say beyock didn’t even get spoken too , WHATS up with that.
YAYAYAYA
Fallon is terrible….
It’s kind of painful to hear Jimmy Fallon pronounce their names
Awesome
Xppl
Ali deserves recognition too✊🏼
Fallon sucks
justice for Ali ✊🏼✊🏼 Rest In Peace my man
외국친구들에게이정재가 출연한영화 관상 추천해주고싶다..
Cant wait! Season 2!
what about the actor who plays ali? he’s literally one of the main characters and one of the most talked about too.
Where is 101 Jang Deok-su?!?!? 😤
ever look up thebout red devil squid he about 190 pound and can form into what they showed on invasion of the body snatcher, no thank you sir.
The ending sucked
I thought it was the PS icon lights on the table of the cast of squid game.
They were all amazing, great acting.
Is this guy the writer in Romance is a bonus book? I really liked him! I have to watch this!!!
JUNG HOYEON HAND IN MARRIAGE PLEASE
I’ve always hated Jimmy for being a fake but showing spoilers? Low.
Wait a second, I just noticed something " The Cast of Squid Game " ??? But where is Ali???🥺🥺🥺🥺 why isn't Ali here??!!!! Why?!!!❗❗❗
Jimmy you are not funny at all
Jimmy fake laugh at the story is pure torture
I wonder if such a ''game'' like squid game is happening in real life in a much secretive way.
"Here are our guests!!!" Shows a TV screen
❤️❤️❤️
This must be how other countries feel when they watch interviews of celebrities in the US
Didn't even recognize the first guy without his long messy hair.
Proud to see South Korea shining with what they’ve been good at for many years now.
god jimmy so cringe in this interview, 4:49 the fake laugh is literally painful. also how are they even doing this interview if they are speaking korean , and he's speaking english? translators in their ears??
they’re so CUTE STOP IT RN
Well at least we know he made it to Los Angeles..
it is arguably one of the best shows of our generation.
Wow💋
067!!!
These guys are actors and they can’t  speak English?
Ohhhh omg, the idea they are on an American show is insane. Proud kdrama Stan
baby squidㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I seriously hope there is a Season 2. Please!
I love how they still use commentary 😂
baby squidㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
한국어💚❤💙
Nobody: Kids under 12: *Lets watch squid game it looks fun!*
The actors have really good vibes!! 🦑😎
Jung and WI  both are so beautiful 😍 really firing all my Bi cylinders lol
Kudos to Jimmy for turning an incredibly difficult and boring interview into...something. Always the professional, with a smile. 🏆
You didnot asked hoyeon any single qustion she just answered a general things that you point it to all of them she is really talented she dont deserve to be ignored like that jimmy dont be sexist
i hate jimmy so much i can’t stand this man
eu so queria uma legenda😔
This is why I don't watch interviews before finishing a show... There's always a spoiler of some kind.
Rip to the people who aren’t used to reading subtitles
I love you all ☺️💙💙💙💙💙💙squid gangggg💜💜💜
Top tier show
Jimmy has been having a lot of Korean guests lately
THEY ARE SO ADORABLE!!!! ❤
Why isn’t ali in there
Omg I am in love with this series xx so freaky but brilliant xxxx
Why in the hell did Youtube give me information for Parasite on a video not even remotely related to Squid Game
No bc WHERES ali
Wi Ha-jung is skin goals
Jesus loves y’all
how did they translate for jimmy to hear in real time
Video: Squid Game Youtube: Parasite Hotel: Trivago
난 또 실제로 간줄 알고 ㅋㅋ 그래도 신기하다
Before K culture - are you from north or south?? After K culture - did you watch squid game??
Uhhhh Lee Jung Jae is not known for playing villains, very rarely he’s played bad guys.  But he’s very famous in Korea.
OH IS MY BOI FROM TRAIN TO BUSAN
“Biggest show in the world”... Críticas, Memes, Detrás de cámaras, Dibujos, Noticias, Vídeos de algunas escenas de la serie... Van haciendo que más y más gente mire la Serie, por morbo, por curiosidad, por estar a la moda... Cada vez la serie es más y más popular... eso no significa que sea la mejor serie de Netflix, simplemente es la más vista... La mejor serie o las mejores series de Netflix son “DARK”  y “BLACK MIRROR” 📺
IT CONTAINS SPOILER !!
Ho-Yeon Jung’s English accent is so cute omg
Jimmy is so fake and over the top in this it's embarrassing. The fake laughing..
As an American, I can really say some of the best shows/movies I’ve seen were Korean . They really know what their doing down there lol
Korean men are so handsome!
국뽕
All so attractive
덱스터 3만원 가자 제발
How were jimmy fallons questions translated for the actors? And vice versa? I’m confused lmao
우왕 너무 멋있다 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Where were the questions for Ho-Yeon? I feel like he didn’t acknowledge her properly in this interview even though she’s just brilliant!
how about other cast
After watching the series, I'm amazed at how gorgeous the lead actor (JUNG JAE) really looks like outside of the show. I didn't even know he usually plays villains. Gonna look up his other Kdramas now. The policeman chara (HA JOON) is also dreamy!
I haven’t watched Squid Game yet but these four people are so attractive, oh my god
They forgot to get the actor for Ali 😢😢
This show had the most intense game of Marbles and Red Light, Green Light
Chick is freaking yummy looking😋
OHMYGOOIFDDDDD
BRO i remember just last week it was about to come out and it was advertising on netflix and then suddenly EVERYONE is talking about it
I lost my husband in this game, then they sent his ripped body in pieces along with cash and note with shapes on it then i woke up from my nightmare...
Love Squid Game but i hate jimmy felon
Feels like I'm watching a Hunger Games interview
So wholesome it’s nice to see them smiling instead of stressed out and in pain in the show 😭
Hoyeon is bae ❤️
This movie so emotional
and we well never look at a PlayStation remote the same way ever again!
Pov: Jimmy is explaining the movie to an audience of ppl who have all seen it.
Player 212 parody https://youtu.be/ZHihCX3YbAY
Nah but fuck all the locals who called k dramas weird and are now obsessed with squid game🤨
I dont like that the girl wasnt asked any questions. She had to integrate herself.
I’m so happy the show got recognition it deserves
Jang tae jun !
im so proud as a korean, i love how my country is now a global phenomenon, starting from music, dramas, and films♡♡
I love Lee Jung Jae's style, he has that movie star aura around him
South Korea sending their best and we have them greeted by Jimmy fucking Fallon.
What is this dumb show
jimmy is so cringe why is he on my feed i hate him
I hate Jimmy’s fake laugh😂
주모~~ 막걸리 퍼뜩 가온나.. 기분 쳐지기네
Welp I know what everyone's going to be hor the next 80 Halloween 🎃
Would have loved to see Ali in this interview
I don't really like Jimmy Fallon but I love the cast so I had to watch this
This cast is just amazing and I hope to see them in more great shows.
"I wanna meet Jimmy brother" 😂😂
BTS is the biggest boy band in the world, BlackPink is the largest girl group on earth, my Samsung S21 Ultra is the smartest phone on the planet and now Squid Game is the most streamed show on Netflix ever. There is no stopping this Korean wave.
Jimmy Fallon is fkin overated
Baby squid 🥺
How can anyone whatcha this phoney 💩 bag, yes JF....... pee you
Lmaooo when he was saying their name at first, it reminded me fanchants 😭
오징어 게임 찐으로 대박낫넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Damn i hope for season 2 ali comes back to life and wins
Ñ,1
South korea is getting big. With BTS becoming universal and now squid games getting so much hype from America. Nice to see
오징어 게임도 재미있지만 한국의 배우들이 지미 팰런 쇼에 출연한 것도 재미있다.
This drama presents memories to Koreans and freshness to foreigners.😁
4:52 the cringe 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
I love squid game
WHERWS ALI 🤬🤬🤬❗❗🤬😡
They all look so stunning
이정재 말할때마다 계속 치인다..
It's funny and sad, how Jimmy just skipped the girl. He didn't even ask her anything or responded to her answer regarding the doll.
https://youtu.be/EAp-pVCXLn8
Koreans make insanely great movies, and I’m very glad they’re starting to be more represented in pop culture. Train to Busan is by far one of my favorite films of all time and my favorite zombie film.
I'm gonna save you now, this does contain spoilers
Okay but why they all so good looking
I knew it she can speak english
i’m literally in love with all of them
4:50 the worst fake laugh I have ever heard in my life lmao😭
I, too, enjoy the Korean children's game of  . . . . Jumping from glass tile to glass tile and praying that I won the 50-50 chance of not having the glass break sending me to my death.
Squid Game phenomenal.....but the F Jimmy still have a job? Jesus so cringe
The best show, really? "Hostel" 1,2 and 3 in particular has almost the same plot, rich people getting bored because they don't know how to spend money anymore and nothing makes them happy and enjoy people getting tortured and killed for fun. give me a break, it's like nobody was watching movies before Netflix.
Where is old man?
wow the fact that he became a father the day the show premiered… two things that changed his life forever happening at the same time
I love the series not too long
Korean TV on fire 2021 #SquidGames #Kingdom
Squid game cast: "hello" Jimmy: *laughs in squid*
지미팰런쇼를 번역기 없이 보고 있다구 ㅠㅠ 넘나 좋다 넘흐 좋다규 ㅎㅎㅎㅎ
They all deserve this recognition,great acting, great series, 👏
I’m shitting and crying, I’m in love with all of them
Love it.
jimmy always spoiling shit, his energy in this was odd. Didnt like it much. Dude seems high as fuck lol
Lee Jung Jae is sooooo beautiful,  i can't 😭😍😭😍
Cringe
What the hell do people see in this show. Breh it's so overrated
Koreans are dope
Hoyeon jung 🥰🥰🥰
😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💗
🇰🇷Humility is considered a virtue in Korean society.
내가 살다살다 자막없이 미국 쇼를 보다니…이거 꿈이죠? ^^*ㅎㅎ오늘은 한글날, 한글로 쓰는 댓글도 자랑스러워 지내요^^*이 쇼를 준비해주신 모든 분께 감사합니다.
i wish jimmy was better at accommodating foreign guests, the transition between each question is so awkward
The last game is the best 😳
An actual good netflix show is very very rare and squid game killed it
They are so amazing ♡♡♡ love all of them
Of course the Pakistani guy dies😭, he was so nice.
MY BELOVEDS <3
Wished he asked Hoyeon a question, or congratulated her on her first acting gig. She killed it!
thank you for loving K-drama 😃👍
Lol YouTube shows Parasite
I've called it over 10 yrs ago.....Korean shows and movies will put Hollywood to shame....and they do so without the over excessive foul language and sexual scene....I've been a fan of Korean talent for a long time....yes this show exceeds it all.
Squid Game season 2 let's go!!!!!!!
"Baby Squid"- nawwwww, that's just too much <3 !
Jimmy laughs like a broken  chicken
i hate that he didn’t ask hoyeon an actual question
Great show
Wherever they are they have better Wifi than SM for their interviews
Wow here it is
Jimmy Fallon is so fake especially when he laughs. It's so cringey to watch.
자랑스럽네요 ^^b
One of the worst series of all time. It sucked
I don’t watch many shows or movies but this one was rly good
❤️❤️❤️
Spoilers in this video!!
Where's Ali, In-lam and ji-young ?
Where’s Ali??!
I love korean culture, so creative stories, not just this one... they definitely rule the world of entertainment in no time!
Poor ali  He was the most humble out of all of them
The movie "Old Boy" started the syndrome  And then there were Train to Busan, Parasite etc. But if you want to Lee Jung Jae's movie, I highly recommend, New World (신세계), a story about undercover police officer in a criminal syndicate.
Jimmy Fallon pretend laughing is... Cringe...
Hoyeon Jung's (Sae Byeok) acting is so impressive considering this is the first show she has ever acted in. She is a natural talent
Spoiler alert....the show sucks!
America loves you guys 🥰
Korea entertainment shows are already popular in US even before you know it. The "Masked Singer " for example, are originated from Korea. US broadcast bought the copyright and able to create their own show.
¿Donde  está Ali? no me dejen a mi muchachon 🙄
자막은 언제 올라오려나...(˃̣̣̣̣︿˂̣̣̣̣ )
K-Pop, K-Dramas and Korean Movies is really dominating the world in this decade I would say.
If the show doesn't get an award this year or the next I will be sooooo mad
They’re all so beautiful I’m very bi rn!!! 😭🥰
Is Jimmy Fallon drunk or on drugs?
is this available on the nintendo switch?
Les amo aaaaaaaaaaa
jeez jimmys fake laugh in this one is way more than usual
Love this show ❤
He spoiled the first episode 🤦‍♀️
Got jimmy is annoying
that guy with the red sweater lives in my mind rent free.
i feel like i m in a chinese buffet
It's so happy today for me because many people abroad love to watch Korean drama
he is no socks again
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Jimmy Fallon > Jimmy Kimmel  but no in all seriousness, this show deserves the amount of support and love it is receiving, to the production team, actors/actresses, the story behind it. This whole cast feels like a family to me and the dynamic shows off and on set ♥   also 1:34 LOL
Why didn’t they invite ali
أين (على) إلى كان بل فلم 🕶️
오징어게임 배우들이 외국 방송 게스트에 나왔구나 알고리즘 떠서 여기 들어왔는데 처음 알았네
Jimmy gettin better at pronouncing korean names👀
🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷 I’m really overwhelmed  how this media could blend in one and made whole world talks about it! Thanks for the great interview jimmy and the team❤️
Not many people know this, but *Season 2* of *Squid game* is acutally coming out soon! It’s stated by the creators in this video: https://youtu.be/Jp2vPVSt8jA
Jesus Loves u and died for ur sins✝️ He is the only way to Heaven🙏🏻
First invasion with K-Pop, K drama, K foods, K cosmetic,  and nowadays with K-Movies. Korean entertainment,  foods , its culture is slowly,  but surely, taking over. Been watching Netflix for years, this is the first time that any Korean movie or drama is number in ninety countries.
Bummed he had zero questions for Jung Ho-yeon, she did not get to say much at all.
The show resonates because in the words of Bong Joon-Ho “we all live in the same country: capitalism.” Capitalism is dehumanizing and incentivizes that we fuck each other over for greed. This is why exploitation is so prevalent. Why the characters all live in debt and are slaves to capitalists. Socialism is the answer. Democratization of the workplace.
When will people notice The Untamed? Its so good! And I'm still baffled that Alice in Borderland did not take off like this, even though it came out on Netflix a year before. I thought it was just as good. Thoughts?
Even my brother was very impressed with this TV series and liked it a lot and since he doesn't enjoy watching Asian movies or productions that surprised me.
Jimmy: No spoilers i’m not giving any spoilers  Also Jimmy: This robot you play red light green light and if you move you die
Parasite?
하...ㅆ바 기훈이형!!
Y’all even Akinator guessed them right 😭
im so in love w them.
This dude has looked the same for 30 years
The cutest group of actors 🤚✨
Video: About squid game Youtube: Nah, it’s Parasite
Anybody else hear “back in 5 seconds” when they was showing the clip?
Annoying fake laugh as always
Overrated show. Good script but bad bad acting !
Hoyeon is so beautiful
Y’all I love them so much-
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I need the detective in my life 🥰😈
AHHHHHH THEYRE SO CONFIDENT I LUV IT 🌸💅
يخي غريب احب جيمي بس ايف في امه مزعج بهذي الحلقه
So proud of them and the recognition they are getting...
*They are all adorable! Oh Sng-yoo my man you are so handsome! Soe-byuk so pretty and speaking English, My Wiha-jun so handsome! I love them all!*
I wish they would invite ali too 😩😪
067 sounds like kermit-
Hoyeon te amo
Amooo
Funny how the biggest television show right now was being rejected by many studios for 10 years. Squid Game was written by Hwang Dong Hyuk in 2008 and finally Netflix took this project in 2018 and now it's the biggest television show ever.
오 지미팰런쇼에 나왔어요? 전세계적으로 열풍이라더니  자랑스럽네요💗
Ho Yeon probably smells so good down there. I would eat all the groceries down there and the salad to.
Baby squid oh god🥺🥺
SO PRETTTTY SHE IS
D.P was forgotten so quickly at the same time 🥲
thanks for the good questions!! i love this
After this I’m gonna go rewatch it, it was really good
Where’s Ali? Ali was the only hero! He save a man’s life with three fingers!
진짜 나 국민학교때  애들끼리 골목에서 놀던 구슬치기 딱지치기 오징어게임 술래잡기 무궁화 꽃이 피었습니다.  띠기 먹기  이런걸 전세계 사람들이 따라할줄은 진짜 내 생애안에 불가능하다고 생각했는데,  그게 실현되었네...
I love it when asian people dont ever brother to learn English, because they don't give 2 fucks.
I didn’t think I can fall in love more with that girl but I did  Edit: By the way, they really couldn’t bring the old man to interview? 🤦🏻‍♂️
I love all of them.. truely love them
This show made me feel every emotion possible 😂 a crazy experience and ingenious show! I don’t know how these actors are going to top this production
이게 뭔일이야 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
OMGGG ICONS ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
jesus christ, jimmy is so friking annoying dude
BABY SQUID!! That’s 100% adorable
WHERE IS ALI😒
had to give a 👍 much love from scandinavia
Ali!!  Missing Ali
God i love squid game and the cast, but i just cant stand jimmy and his fake laugh...
Wow. Finally, they are in here~
The fake laughing from Jimmy. SMH. He tried so hard to engage the guests.
Not to hate but I love how jimmy is trying so hard to laugh
한국적인걸 세계에서 이렇게 좋아할줄 몰랐는데~~ 자랑스러운 한류~ 한류의 모든걸 전세계인들과 함께하길❤
Hoyeon's english is so satisfying😌
Jung Ho-yeon:the boy and the gurrr And can’t she is so cute😂😂💕

이왜진?
BABY SQUID 🦑 😫😭😍
Now let's have more East Asians in major Hollywood roles, please! 👌
SQUID GAME!!!! I am so proud to be Korean !!!!!!!!!!!

The whole CAST 🔥🔥🔥
He wants to meet Jimmy Fallon 🥺❤️
😂💜
Satanic people satanic shows
the baby squid story made me melt— like genuinely in awe of how well this show is doing. so glad that k-dramas are being appreciated so greatly internationally 🥲
4:52 Why this laugh sound so fake lol
Honestly squid game was spread my mouth with everyone talking about it
Ali should be in this :(
they look so fine
I cried when sang-woo betrayed Ali but it was still amazing
I love the show and I can’t wait for season two
where's Ali tho?
Who else went to episode one and now can't unsee her laughing when he missed the cup like 20 times?
God I adore them all
Where the fuck is Ali tho
The show is amazing and the 3 Last episodes are the most sad Moments of Television history i cry a lot i know many People will feel the same 😥
Wi Ha-Joon 😍😍😍
🐙🐙🐙🐙
love the amazing Asian representation and how they speak in their own language. Also finally the world is recognizing Asian culture and entertainment. They are so polite and so down to earth. No trying too hard like some other fallon guests. feeling so happy!
Jimmy Is like so akward
يمعودين ترجمو لقاء راح اموت 😂😂😂
Squid Game !

Yusss
Brilliant
Fallon user
ESTA GRAN SERIE  ES SUPER HERMOSA COMO BTS
Bruh Jimmy spoiled a whole first episode😂
https://youtu.be/_2GvKaJyhb4
lol Jimmy’s forced laugh after the improv story about the straw
We need korean influence here in the west, we need to change how we think, act or be, else we will forever end in an egalitarian consumerirsm dystopian future where all that matters is ourselves.
*https://youtu.be/ToJckZe3Bdc* ⚠️⬆️⬇️⬆️🖤🖤🖤⬆️⬇️⬆️⚠️ *https://youtu.be/ToJckZe3Bdc*
it surprised me today, I saw in some bar TV this video in the news, like wow
"i think part of the appeal is the korean children's games"  no sir, its you im obsessed with
I didn't think I'd like it but thought I'd watch one episode and see what all the fuss was about. OMG.  I got hooked and binged it in two days.  Amazing.  Didn't think there was going to be much of a story to it - but there was.  I even shed a tear in episode 6!
Who watches late night anymore?
"its BABY SQUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIID" -Hae Soo's baby 10 minutes before premier
Where is ali the character player 199 😥
Hoyeon speaking english was so cute PLSSSS
No hate but guys don’t you think that jimmy can’t even interview properly  the amount of times he shutters to speak a single line
right now~~~🤣👍
국뽕 채우고갑니다^^
BABY SQUIDD
why? you didn't invite ali who is the most strongest player among these
MY BABYS I LOVE THEM SM!!
is Jimmy drunk? hes so awkward and almost fake today lol
I wanted Hoyeon Jung to talk more smh why didn't he ask her any questions
I really want to wach this but.........I know Jimmy Fallon gonna screw this up..... SAD.
This series is so entertaining!
eu tô muito apaixonadinha pelo cast de squid game, assisto toda interview que tem deles, quero ver eles em todos os programas possíveis!
Why isn’t ali in this interview?
https://youtu.be/qkQlw4miYgE
Where is Ali? 😔
지미 팰런쇼에서 이정재를 볼 줄은 진짜 몰랐다 허허
China, China and fuck you Biden..
SHE SPEAKS ENGLISHHH???
정재형 헐리웃가즈아~~!!!
OMG HO YEONG MY LOVE LOOKED SO PRETTY
I wish the actor who played the old man got invited to interviews as well. He deserves as much recognition.
S2 will be even more legendary
Detective is so hot
Where is Ali and the old man?
I love it!!!
Jimmy doesn't even interview the girl or pays much attention to her. Geez....
I'm happy that Korean dramas/movies are getting the recognition that they deserve😊😍
Woo Shiesty
Ok but I wish the Indian actor was also present
Jimmy really wanted to say that Squid game was/is better than but he paused . So anyone who can guess it what Jimmy was about to say
It was a good show.. but why did it become THIS big?
“Winners exist because of the losers” should be a real housewives tagline
Every day hes getting closer to sounding like Rick
You know it's good when your friends are suggesting to watch a series on Netflix.
I live in the UK and everyone was talking about the squid game, so when I saw it, I couldn't sleep.  It was a really great drama.  It was a really refreshing shock
it is amazing and terrifying how you can make a child games scary
Where’s my baby Anupam
Jimmy Fallon's fake enthusiasm is irritating
It's amazing how Korean Entertainment industry is producing binge-worthy films/series and achieving massive success! I am happy I get to watch different films all over the world via netflix, no hate US but it's been a long while since last watched any of yours!
Sae Byeok’s actor is so ethereal.
I love you so much🍃🙃💐♥️
미국인들 중에 영어 못 쓰는 사람도 많다더니 유명한 티비쇼 진행자도 쉬운 영어 위주로 쓰네... 이렇게 한국 배우들 보니깐 좋다ㅎㅎ
Hopefully, finally, more people will wake up to how good Korean dramas are and why I watch them all the time now.
The hard worked payed off 😌
Congratulations 👏 Haesoo baby squid is so cute 😍
I love them so much 🥺🥺
Where's Ali 😭?
would like to see a filipino set up version of this one and hoping this would be in the same universe of squid game and  its gonna be called patintero haha,
Man this show was so good. Haven’t seen anything this good in a while.
Waaaonesa series was the best of the best I saw it 3 times. hey I loved it. and I'm crazy with the Korean series.
this show deserves all the fame it’s getting rn no 🧢
PLS BABY SQUID, I CANT
Bro i like jimmy but he's so ungenuine its honestly insane lol
I hope people start to recognize korea for producing quality series not only by kpop.
They are so adorable ♡♡
SQUID GAMES TAKING OVER THE WORLD https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCchGaT0slcvGn6RqBVamS_g
Amazing to see first a korean show promoted like this and with subtitles!!!
오우 펄럭 ㅋㅋㅋ
cringe fake laughing
Squid Game came out of nowhere and became the biggest hit on streaming of all time.  It's a brilliant show and deserves all the recognition it gets.
"It is bigger than-"  OKAY STOP RIGHT THERE JIMMY 😃
why isnt Ali in any of the cast videos 😭
Also starring on this hit show are Mi Fook-Yu, Peez Un-Mi, Ee Rek-Shoon, and Sook Mi-Toong.
always so surreal to see Americans interact with Korean culture, both good and bad
They're amazing!
♥♥♥♥
Jimmy Fallon clearly hasn't seen the show lol
4:21 Jungje said,  That was a N.G. scene but it was contained in the film directly becuz the director love the scene.  :) This was commented in another talk show.
https://youtu.be/9SJUhdHc-No.
“Back in 5 seconds”
Wow ep 7 was so sad
who was rooting for gi-hun... not me that's for sure, but i do think that means he was doing a great job at portraying his character!
Why are there 4 pictures of the same dude in that thumbnail? 🤷‍♂️ Btw all these robot comments saying goofy awkward shit on here are hilarious 🤣 lol
Please sub korean!!
I love the show 10/10
Ali is really a goat
Squid Game >>> Gangnam Style.
✨baby squid✨
i love them so much 😩😩
It’s so nice to see a kdrama become so famous in such a short amount of time
3:56 to clarify, Young Hee is the equivalent name for Jane Doe, and Chul-Soo is for John Doe.
자랑스런 배우님들 ^^
How are they communicating?
its not a television show its a netflix show
wish i could see this show for the first time again 😩 so good
Alguém brasileiro?
3.6M de vistas
This series was very good. I hope there will be a 2nd season! These actors were lovely! Jung Ho-yeon looks so beautiful!
The squidgame main cast : Let's all wear black and not tell Ha-joon 😂
The actor that played ALi had that doll, it was a gift for him
just know that i’m watching this for the cast, not for you jimmy. i don’t like you.
I've seen Wi Ha-joon in a couple other k-dramas.  I really like that guy
Jimmy- “I’m not giving any spoilers” Also Jimmy- “He saved you, he saved you”
So happy for inviting them ❤️❤️😘
Why is it always only these 4 who are credited as the main cast of squid game? Imo they should also include the pakistani guy and the gangster guy in these interviews. Those 2 characters also had more elaborate backstories and shld be considered as part of the main characters.
Aww jimmy thought he meant he realized it was big because he’s there with HIM 🥺 but he meant getting interviewed a lot
This interview was awkward
They didn’t ask Hoyeon one question -___-
Why is the lady on the side instead of in the middle after all she is the only actress on this show. So sexist!
Park Hae-soo is cute. ;-)
Jimmy - "so this is what happens in this part of the movie" Jimmy 3 mins later - "No spoilers!"
Where's Ali Abdul?😭
i love them SO MUCH SQUID GAME WAS AMAZING I HOPE THERE WILL BE A SEASON 2 SOON <3
HO YEONG HOW ARE YOU SO PERFECT I LOVE YOUUUU😭💗💗💗
How gentlmen... Lady comes first... of course...
The show also shows that how far can people go to acheive money even if they have to risk their for it they are just greedy they always want more and more even though they can focus on their needs rather then their wants
They are all talented, amazing actors, actresses!!! Once you start episode 1, you can't stop until you finished! Hope the director will produce season 2 squid game within next few years!
This should show people that’s it’s not the people against each other, everyone loves this show, it’s our government’s that start war
they should bring frontman too for interview
I'm happy theres asian representation but WHERES ALI????

Fly me to Hoyeon!
This show was wayyyyyyy too good. 😝👏🏾Literally watched it in 2 days. I havent watched many horror korean shows. Ive mostly watched feel good romance ones🙂
The doll is named "Julie" in the Philippines. Look it up, people! lol
I hate Jimmy Fallon laugh. Can something be done about that?
All of them are so adorable!
정호연 영어발음 존나치인다
That girl she's mine 💕
Where is Ali and the old man??? I'm so confused???
Dalgona and ppopki are all from the forgotten tradition of Japan called Katanugi. The right-handed umbrella on the candy is only used in Japanese signage.  Katanugi was forgotten due to the possible fire scars which will last forever in a child's life. Boiling Sugar and Baking Soda together is very hazardous.  https://youtu.be/YmwGyAQtJTY <- RARE modernized and industrialized Katanugi video. Most of them are made at the factories for safety.  South Koreans are adding Saccharin for further enhancing sweetness of Ppopki now in Seoul, South Korea. You could find the recipe videos of Korean uploaders showing 'New Sugar' in the list of the ingredients. New Sugar is the product name of the white powder mixture of Glucose and Saccharin. Most of the South Korean foods are full of artificial additives for the bad quality of South Korean agricultural products and no cold chain. The adoption rate of cold chain is similar to that of Thailand in South Korea.

They are so fine
Lee jung jae you should explain your to people that ur faking eating and Ali saw you and he laughed 😃
Binged this show so fast last weekend. Loved every second!!!
They’re all so cute 😭😭
loved you guested the cast of Squid game but i hope all of the cast together
Let's make baby squid too!
The young police guy with red shirt is lying in the video. All the games and foods in the drama are from Japanese tradition.
Free palestine
What’s the name of the song?
It's very huge in Russia! Thank youuuu
Yey! I'm so proud of South Koreans! Saranghaeyo! #1Entertainment
Y’all not only South Korea is proud of them, the entire Asia continent is proud of them <3
😂😂😂👻😂😂😂
Glad to see them
Hablan coreano pero se siente elegante que cuando veo a alguien que habla español nativo no hablando inglés , se que es raro a de ser por qué es mi lengua nativa y crítico más a lo mío.
Wow spoiler
This isn't my favorite of the late night shows, but I am THRILLED that you guys did this interview and the games with the cast. It was so fun and respectful and I'm glad people are getting more exposure to internationally done entertainment.
국뽕한사발♡♡♡
대한민국 만세!
Quien sin entender ni madres pero igual viendo la entrevista 🏃🏻‍♀️
The audience randomly laughing at everything was weird asf. I’m glad I don’t watch the tonight show anymore…
001 wins
What if one day you are walking thru Los Angeles and you see hundreds of impoverished persons sleeping, "pooping", and doing drugs on every sidewalk.  The next day you take the same walk and the sidewalks are clean and empty. You might 'thank' the recently re-elected California governor. But "what if" he had arranged "a game" that lured all of these desperate people into a facility where they were forced to compete for 'a prize' where there would be one winner, but everyone else is quickly and immediately killed. Their corpses sold on the black web as body parts. The income from which helps pay for this "game" and California's massive debt. The names, personalities, and histories of all of these disparate 'dead' people all erased - no care or compassion for their lives, or the loved ones they left behind. Would that be a good thing?
Fun Fact: When i was a kid i got a shoe with a reverse swoosh and it's labelled "Mike". But that shoe ain't nowhere near as fake as this laugh 4:52
THEYRE ALL SO ATTRACTIVE AND TALENTED i’m in love with all of them
I want to see the ah gong on show leh
good luck🤗🤗🤗🤫🤫💓
Will there be a season 2 ?
Spoiler Alert! Damn Jimmy. Don't do that!
Where is our beloved Ali Abdul
Hello everyone. How are you acting?🤫🤫🤫🤗🤗💓
Squid game is not a drama. It's a reality in  which we live; Capiltalism. It's meaningless to distinguish who he is. What matters is we must behave samely for survival.  In the drama, Jiyoung who voluntarily  gave up her life symbolizes a anti capitalistic character. Worth attention.
I love seeing the actors that showed up at the Tonight Show, however, WE WANT ALI! 1K likes, Ali gets invited on The Tonight Show!
Liked it before even watching
Wait? Did they really speak in English?  In the squid game movie?   Is it Really English?
Where is Ali?. 😭😭
Wheres grandpa
The studder tho
오징어 게임 화이팅❤️
❤️
airsoft red light green light would be awesome 0.0
4:51 can jimmy fallon stop doing this fake laughing shit? It'a annoying as fuck
Love it❤❤ btw Jimmy is so humble & kind always❤ the way he communicates with anyone i jst love it❤
Thought that was the PlayStation logo on the table where the cast is sitting lol. Pickpocket girl is so gorgeous.
phahahaha   Baby squid is indeed a lucky charm!
Wait a minute. Are they still alive?
Bro it’s the guy from that zombie movie, train to busan. Love that guy.
I see Korean stars is now atomic in Outside reality shows  because Of some boyband.. you know what i mean right
I can absolutely say that South Korea is kinda dominating the world rn, I am so happy and Prouded as being an Asian 💜.....
JUNG HOYEON seems likes a cheerful and talkative girl, he should've asked some questions to her too!
주모 술가져와~
That was such a bad interview
When Ha-Joon is talking about the appeal of the Korean children's games being why this resonates all over the world. I feel like that's a huge part of it but maybe even more-so that many of those games are children's games not just in Korea but everywhere. And the greed, and hope, and struggles are all universal and human. These characters are so relatable and the actors were phenomenal.

“He saved you. I love it.” Ali 💚
I’m soo happy that the crew of squid game is on Jimmy fallon Show, also happy in that i can understand korean right away
The best show on Netflix visiting the worst show on television...
no spoilers but spoils red light green light.
Jimmy Fallon, I hate you!
I'm loving Jimmy's excitement here
Season 2 already anyone
These guys are so handsome. I love them
EWW anyone else remember that?
Oh My Wi Wi baby 😍

한국인은 좋다 저 아저씨말 말고 다 알아들으니

Where is ALI??????????
Alice in borderland 10x better!!!
Baaaaaby squid du du du du du du …..
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Jimmy Fallon is a great host . He is so friendly and talks so comfortably . Our papa mochi. 😁
Baby squid
In turkey it is a big hit! still so popular
국뽕 터진다
WHERE’S ALI 😔😔😢
PARK HAESOO is so charismatic !
직이네 ㅎ
Why is Ali not with them on the show😕
CAN WE ALL TAKE A MOMENT...to realise this might just the first time in history a U.S Talk Show has used a translator and allowed non-English speaking guests on? I hate woke culture, but THIS is diversity.
우리 프론트맨도 영어 잘하는데 캐릭터상 공개석상에 나갈수 없으니 아쉽네 ㅠㅜ 제작발표회, 메이킹영상, nbc 그 어느곳에도 없다 ㅠ
woah look at that shoes wow im lovin it wow
Thank you for worldwide foreign viewers. As Korean, It is grateful and we really appreciate it. As long as you all enjoyed it, thats all we need
squid game season2  ######
Where's ali and the old man? 🥺
Fuck you jimmy…you made him a hatred one…we fucking hate you…so bad…us….
강성한 문화를 지닌 나라가 세계를 선도할거라던 옛 선조들의 말씀이 바로 이시대에 보여지는 현상을 예지하신듯 합니다.
Is it just me or does Jimmy look very nervous when he talks to the cast
So interesting!!
I love that serie. It’s just surprising and sad when you watch someone else die
What a Beautiful language
All are good looking but the guy 2nd to the left is very attractive.
#1 in 90 countries, it was literally just released about last month wow❤ such a success. I also love how Ho Yeon seems to be fluent in English.
It’s huge here in Germany on Netflix good job 🇰🇷 🇩🇪
우와~~우와~~대박
Is it me or does the pink square become invisible with the wall?
Bro I wish the drama “It's Okay to Not Be Okay” would be this famous so people can see the amazing acting of Oh Jungse he is just in another level
Doesn’t the police officer speak english?
OMG I LOVE THEM SO MUCH I CANT
Wow Jimmy is so awk LOL
He didn’t as Hoyeon any questions 😪
❤❤❤❤❤🙂😍
Loved SQUID GAME 👏👏👏👏👏
why is ali not here?
Hello, I have been a huge Korean drama lover. 😊 I usually watch other Korean dramas.
Where is Ali
I love them🥺
I’ll never forget ever
Jimmy, you are the best.
I love park hae soo since he's on prison playbook and i know wi ha joon because of 18 again
국뽕이 차오른다...!
I loved that scene 😍
Director of Squid game said "was this how BTS felt when they ranked #1 on billboard? " referring to the global attention that squid game has received.
All so attractive
Music: BTS Film: Parasite Series: Squid Game  Korean entertainment industry is taking over the world right now.
Best show ever
its huge here in the philippines.. congratulation guys.. well deserved
Squid Game my most favorite series ever👍🏼
와 진짜 오징어게임이 이정도라고?? ㅁㅊㄷㅁㅊㅇ
Ali?:(
Green Light,  Red Light
Hoyeon's first drama is such a huge success! I am looking forward to see her
Nobody:  Korean in the end of any sentences:  "Swida"
한국어 인터뷰도 좋긴 한데 이제 한국 배우도 윤여정배우처러 영어회화 능력을 좀 더 보강하면 좋을듯. 이건 사대주의가 아니라 그래야 대화가 물흐르듯 진행되지. 한국을 대표할 만한 자리나 일상회화 이상의 복잡한 인터뷰, 언어자체가 핵심요소인 경우(노래) 등등은 한국어 써야 맞는데 이렇게 팬들 상대로 가벼운 인터뷰 하러 가는 건 영어로 하면 더 좋을듯
Where is Anupam
배우분들이 나오니까 격이 올라감을 느끼겠네요.. 한국어로 인터뷰하니까 정통성도 느끼고 자랑스러워요
STOP BABY SQUID
누가 번역좀
I love it
Someone please call the actor who played Ali and also the old man for interviews and stuff, they're the actors who played the best characters and they're the ones not getting attention
Here in New Zealand we don't have sub-titles but dubbing. The voice acting is sooo bad!
there were no questions for hoyeon wtf????
🦑👏🔥🇰🇷🌈
1:28 I think Jimmy was about to say "it is bigger than Friends" but stopped thinking of the criticism he would receive.
This show has deeply changed the game of tug o war for everyone. The impact the show has on various of types of people in various ways is tremendously impressive and unlike 90% of films that have been created.
I am very proud of you~ and I am very happy to see you in this show!!!
Exactly that moment extremely brave🔥🔥🔥🔥
So glad they are on the show, the deserve the praise! Enjoyed the show!

All of the verified people commenting on this video are adding absolutely nothing with their input
Actually not only in Netflix . We've got  already translations in other platforms. It's marvellous masterpiece of actors.  And amazing scenario 🔥🔥🔥
Lee Jungjae is really famous because of dramas and movies. (This comment is mostly for young Koreans who are saying he is not all that) He was in 모래시계, 느낌, 신세계 etc. He has played all types of characters and received all kinds of awards. I think he can be compared to previous fame of Matt Damon, level of acting of Leonardo DiCaprio.
Would've loved Anupam Tripathi in here too
Cute
So happy for them...
Me encanta!! Corea del Sur está siendo cada día más y más famoso, entre lo que es el kpop, doramas y sus películas, están haciendo muchas cosas buenas.
I like the way Park Hae-soo answer hangul+eng (jiguem right now)
Number 1 in 90 countries for 3 straight weeks bro
HAHAHAHA jimmy Fallon plastic, olol
Jimmy's good at pronouncing Korean names now.
Hopefully thiers season 2
I'm watching also Squid games
She is 10/10. My goodness!
Jimmy had it right, is not about children games, it's about people willing to die for money. Well done.
WHERE'S MY MANS ALI??? :(((((
자.. 자막좀..
Can't wait season 2
Love iiittttt !!!
Very dangerous video epic episode  https://youtu.be/yLWBCv2YOU8
Wish Ali and number 001 were there but anyway, kdrama is not my cup of tea but this gonna add to my list of favorite
I'm not even Korean but I feel like this deep sense of pride. 😥 I'm so happy to see K-dramas get the recognition they deserve. Shine on guys!!! ✨✨💛✨
That doll gave me nightmare's. I don't like dolls. Made me smile when I heard the guy became a dad. His smile was so big. There is not one person I know who isn't watching show even my daughter and her friends and they are 11.  I couldn't stop her. she says it is violent and addicting at the same time
Jimmy is an asswipe… he didn’t even speak to or ask the female actress anything
Ever watched The Lake House starred Keanu Reeves? You should watch the original Il Mare starred by Lee Jung Jae
어쩔꺼야ㅠ 한국💜
Why is he giving spoilers?
jimmy is gay!
The Squid Game is the best serie. Congratulations, and thanks The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon for ur interview .
Jung Jae pipi nya gemoy 😊😅
이정재 양복에 맨발....정말 ㅂㅅ 같다..ㅋㅋ
Wanna play a game with me? 😏 Anyway it's 100% superb ✨and relatable
Squid game best TV series♡♡
Thank you very much for inviting the actor, actresses!!
jungjae is so cute😍
Parasite is the recommended movie 💀 they are messed up for that
Where is that Indian guy
I was so shocked when I first saw an interview with the actors. Sangwoo had such an impact and I hated him so much by the end of the show I was fully prepared to hate the actor as well but Haesoo is so sweet I can't believe how well they all played their characters.
Omg the baby squid aaaaaaaaaaawww is soooo cute omg
SQ...finish it in 9 hours...lol
These actors need to start learning english since their gonna be international stars
wow
I'm Asian and I'm seriously jealous of South Korea. They're seriously starting to dominate film industry. First Parasite, now this
I wish Jimmy asked Jung Ho-yeon questions. He mostly focused on the men.
the only time i willingly watch jimmy fallon
Dam Jung Ho-yeon speaks English pretty well
The show: 💀🔪🩸 The actors: 🥰💖🥺
Where's ali huhu
stupid game.
Ew
The educated detective correlatively arrange because product numerically rot inside a noiseless nepal. left, sassy camel
What I like about the show is the different way they played on the Japanese manga and movie but a more human twist
It's time for me to learn Korean. Annyeong! 😍
Anyone else notice the “Cyberpunk” watermark or whatever behind the Korean cast?
I'm so happy for the cast  👏
Why isn’t Ali included? 😒
the stuttering
Hey cut Ali out of promo!
wheres the character named ALI  heree !!!?
That 2nd person looks like somebody from bts
i hope they can interview to all kpop idols  as well
💗💗💗💗💗💕
Va iubesc pe toti m am uitat si eu la jocul calamarului si am plans tare!
i love the fact that Jimmy Fallon show is Universal interview and they accept any culture
Lee jung jae😍😍😍😍😍😍
Baby squid aaaahhhhhhh ❤
Jimmy fallon is so over enthusiastic with everything he just seems so in-genuine to me, kinda like a kids TV host
wheres Anupam Tripathi, guys got to be there for these media appearances too! we loved his character ALI <3
kdrama actors?This is UNEXPECTED😮
세계적으로 주목받는 오징어 게임 아 가슴이 웅장해진다
한국인으로서 정말 자랑스럽다 기분좋다
OMGGGG
Squid game me tiene atrapada, y la vi hace una semana 👋
Where the fark is Ali?
Ok but why is Jimmy yelling?
I'm a primary school teacher in Finland. Today, after work as I walked to my car, I heard a familiar shout in the schoolyard "Mugunghwa kkoci pieot seumnida!" Pupils were playing Red Light Green Light using the Korean language. It was awesome but I felt chills creeping my spine at the same time.
4:51 엠씨 억지웃음 ㄷㄷ
Wish this was in person
oppa oppa Sorry Daddy sorry Daddy sorry mommy sorry mommy
Did anyone else get bothered by how he didn’t ask HoYeon Jung any questions?
Very good show! Good looking cast too
they are SO CUTE
Wow
Wow, this is actually history in the making. The most popular show around the world is in Korean with subtitles. Enjoying other people's culture, on a global scale, simultaneously. I can feel the tides shifting, I can feel the pulse of the planet embracing this new progressive change. I feel elated, hopeful and wonderful. It's time, it's finally time. The chapter of separation and prejudice is ending, and the chapter of international community and connection is beginning.  Let's make it happen. :-)
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ신기하네 이거
Their stocks going up rn
"Not giving any spoilers tonight " then proceeds to show a clip of one of the most heart-stopping moments and robbing everyone who didn't see it of that anxiety attack. 🤦🏽‍♀️
I love it!!!
방탄 나오는것만 보다가   한국 배우들이 여기 나오니 신기하네ㅋㅋ
proud of them<3 watching them grow
The testy paint roughly agree because onion booly rot through a deadpan request. ceaseless, descriptive action
👏👏👏👏
이정재 월클 ㅇㅈ
3 milly in 1 day damn
I am really happy for them but sad because Ali isn't there cause without him the lead wouldn't even survive the first game
we r looking for baby 🦑
That baby is already trending so cute💜
Park Hae Soo and Wi Wi oppa sarangi
Wait so they dont speak English I knew something was off because the words did not match up in the show so how does he know what there saying 🤔
SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET OVER THE SUBTITLES. also here's a list of their other work because they deserve all the recognition in the world Park Hae Soo: prison playbook (iconic, truly iconic), persona ep 2, time to hunt Lee Jung Jae: chief of staff, the new world Wi Ha Joon: romance is a bonus book, shark: the beginning, midnight, 18 again, Que sera sera (UPCOMING!!) (yes i'm biased, i've watched this dude since the beginning of his career & am very fucking proud to see his success don't blame me this is barely all his work just my faves) Jung Ho Yeon: BELIEVE IT OR NOT THIS IS HER FIRST ROLE EVER
aww that’s literally so cute baby squid
Korean dramas/movies are really on another level..
I’m shitting and crying, I’m in love with all of them
90 countries??? Wow when they I am not too depressed I will for sure watch it
Nice interview!
Where is that pakistani actor???
i really like the cast, but I find Jimmy to be a very uncharismatic speaker.
이름 발음하느라 노력 많이 했네요!
Describes exactly what the doll does and the first game.  “I’m not giving any spoilers, no spoilers tonight”
Honestly I can’t understand how could  ppl in their right mind watch such horrifying scenes in this drama. This shows world z full of horrifying ppl.  This drama z very overrated fr it’s story n the female lead got unnecessary hype along with this drama. There r lot of awesome kdramas that didn’t come to limelight while dramas like this overshadowing them.  Male leads were great they deserve it fr their acting skills.  Btw baby squid used only few English words yet his accent z so sexyyyyy mind blowing.
i love you ❤️
lewat beranda. penasaran ini.acara apa y. 🤭
ㅋㅋㅋ
thank squid game ❤️🤣😂😘😘😘😘😘😘
👍👍👍👍👍
Lee Jung-Jae is so handsome, cute, prim, proper, humble, talented. What a man! ❤️❤️❤️😍
청~제이~ 😂
Where's ma boi Ali?
is it just me who see that jimmy is a bit nervous? 😬
아주 멋찐 배우들^^ 짱짱!!!!
THEIR ENGLISH IS SO ADORABE
is there a dubbed version of this interview, like how they dubbed the series show?
Hahahahaha that scene Gi Hun as character remembered 😂😂😂 I didn’t noticed it because it’s too fast but the spoilers spoils all 😂😂
The placid sand rapidly offend because lyric conventionally kiss afore a domineering clutch. serious, juvenile dessert

신과함께를 보게될 것이다
I'm so happy for them but I really wish Anupam Tripathi (who played "Ali Abdul") was here as well?? His character is one of the most talked about & loved character, also very important. He should get his due recognition.
짧아서 아쉽다
i saw this video on tiktok and so many people talking about their accent...so im here to watch
not to mention roblox squide game is really popular thanks to them
Squid 🦑 gale shorts https://youtube.com/shorts/6A7BtOlrndc?feature=share
한국사람 쏘리 질러~~
A lot hates Sang-woo but loves Hae-soe <': I WANT TO SEE BB SQUID 😭
The girl has good English and she is so pretty :)
Jimmy is so fake bro 🤣😂
아.. 해외 쇼에 나온 BTS를 볼때 느꼈던 자랑스러움과 이제는 세계적으로 나누어야한다는 상실감 같은게 뒤섞인 묘한 느낌을 여기서 또 느끼네..
JIMMY comes off as so weird and fake with that psycho laugh
Sony should sue for the playstation  logo
Eyy where's my man ali?
Any Koreans here? 한국인들 없나요!!
머머.. 머라노... 자막해도 영어자막인디... 머라노..
Love it !
좋아요~
We just gonna squid game and meme our way out of existence, it's fucking sad is what it is. Meanwhile our future freedom and human rights are being destroyed before our very eyes..
BABY SQUID 😭
I love Jimmy and how he exerts effort 😭💕💕🥺🥺🥺😍😍😍
She so damn pretty 😍
what so good abt this series..it is so so...saw is much2 better...more blood..more deadly game
Lee, Jung Jae is one of my favorite Actor ~ I love to see him ❤️
The best Korean series ever!
I recommend goblin, Hotel Del Luna, It's Okay, That's Love, Crash Landing on You, moon lovers scarlet heart ryeo to those who like romance k dramas in netflix. Just watching one of them makes your life happier😉
Lee Jung Jae's smile lights up my world 😁
Jung hoyeons English is really good
Jung-Jae character was funny?? Isn't that supposed to be that other lady that is good at everything except the things she isn't good at?
To see Korean media and culture so widely viewed and celebrated over the years makes me so proud as a Korean.
Squid game literally went from 1 to 90 in a day.
why do i feel like jimmy watched it in english dub ;-;
I think when Korea was born it rained and everything where rain fell  turned into gold because even though it was hard for Koreans in the beginning but now they are so powerful and dominating in all fields be it Music, Dramas, Movies ,fashion, Food and they are now dominating Netflix.
I really wish they also asked Tripathi Anupam (the guy who plays Ali) to join  🥺
https://youtu.be/EnxhqVMlRMI
Hoyeon english is really amazing 😲
korean drama
*Читаешь мой коментарий, желаю тебе и твоей семье, крепкого здоровья!*
Squid game one of the best korean series
I enjoy how the show shows human reactions and probabilities. Was it predictable? Yes, but only because actions and consequences play out IRL like this, there will always be someone ready to push and sacrifice you, &shield behind you .  Artificial food shortages and a stage set to keep us "groundlings" fighting amongst ourselves while Elites pull the strings and watch their "antfarm"  all the players were given the choice to join knowing the ultimate risk could be death, yet they still chose it for money.  Sounds parallel to our society now.  Everything being done is entertainment and justified by the one calling the shots.
I love how humble they are and I just feel like "damn its so nice to meet you guys"
“I’m not giving any spoilers tonight” right after he explained the entire plot, even describing the first game💀
Where is Ali?!?!?!?!
여기 일남 할아버지 왜 안 모시냐고
I'm Korean and it still feels so weird yet fascinating to see a Korean show end up topping Netflix all over the world. I wouldn't be surprised if this show was popular within Asia only...but to be popular in the US, Europe, South America and even Africa...basically every continent...just WOW. I doubted this would happen cuz I thought it was just not bad but I guess I was wrong~
https://youtu.be/LujGdjy7QCI
https://youtu.be/ZSSWmitF3TI
Jimmy Fallon is a total sellout.
Squid Games the Ending WTF ......Very Original and Thank Netflix for having a English Version RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT, ONE, TWO, THREE OH NOOOO
I love all the cast but Ali should have been there!!! I wanted to see him
I still can't believe they are in Jimmy Fallon show👏 k drama Power ❤
“Back in 5 seconds”
Nice
"I am not giving spoilers" yo wtf
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I like this drama very much 😍. It teach a good lesson to us. I believe that money make people crazy and they do thing as animals. But the character of sang woo i love it very much. I think he do his best to this wonderful drama.
Jimmy is so awkward
미국에서 만든 유튜브란 플랫폼을 통해 한국음악이 세계에서 유명해지고, 미국에서 만든 넷플릭스라는 플랫폼을 통해 한국드라마가 세계적으로 인기를 끌게 되는 날이 오네요. 미국 고마워요.
uwu
I noticed that racism towards south Koreans mostly come from other asians, especially from the Chinese and Japanese. The rest of the global population seems to be nice though.
Hahaha I exprct Jimmy to try the Squid game haha..
Lee jungjae😍😍😍😍😍
Bruh the movie down there is listed wrong it was parasite instead of squid game
The endinnnnnnnngggg😭😭😭😭😭😭 Aliiii😭
I'm so happy for this. ASIAN FREAKING REPRESENTATION Y'ALL LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!11111!!11!!1!!1
We maybe apart but we do feel the same.
The Squidgame's storyline was started about more than a decade ago. Which means after all these years, it was worth it
Go go squid 🐙
오일남 어르신이랑 허성태도 나왔음 좋았을텐데
Yooo where is ALI?!?! Him and his brother is so cute 😭
한국어로 인터뷰한거 개멋있네 뭔가
i love the cast but not the host
The high-definition picture of Lee Jung Jae, the main actor of the squid game,  It's on the "Everyone Art" channel.
Sad to think 2 of them won't be back for season 2
Aww baby squid
I LOVE JIMMY OMG THE WAY HE'S ALWAYS SO FRIENDLY AND NICE AND HYPES EVERY GUEST SPECIALLY INTERNATIONAL ONES
till the day we can be free from language barriers
Omg they all have amazing skin!
I'm just so embarrassed that Fallon is interviewing anybody from outside America. He's a fake wank - what's with all the stupid laughing??  Ew.
Hoyeon Jung is not being talked about
1:58 Jimmy actually teared up right there! Man wasn't ready for that compliment.
대한민국 만세~~🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
And the girl was asked practically NO QUESTIONS AT ALL. He’s just a bad tv host.
영어 댓글이 엄청 많네 우리나라 배우들 자랑스럽습니다!!🇰🇷🇰🇷
0:30 that sounded a little bit like Sofia Vegara. ( Thank you for having us )
jung hoyeon is STUNNINGGGG PLS
훌륭한 연기 훌륭한 작품이에요. 유일하게 남녀 모두 포함해서  팬으로서 좋아하는 연예인이 이정재 형님. 데뷔때부터 팬입니다. 다시태어나면 형님처럼 생기고 싶네요. 참고로 전 남자. 축하드립니다.
Damn that North Korean is pretty

Best show ever. For the last 3 years all i have mostly been watching is korean and chinese shows at home.
As a Greek dude, I have been watching Korean Tv series for the last 18months and Ive been telling all my friends both in Europe and Australia that OMGGG the Korean's make BETTER shows/movies  than the Americans. No one listened to me lol. Im glad now that Squid Game has opened up to the world about Kdrama.
Ali 🥲
Thanx for having them, Jimmy!
I told my friend about the doll’s name and she said “shut up they made that up” and I was like “ahaha wtf” and she said I WAS dumb like Chile anyways so..
Where the fck is Ali????!!!!!
Why the actor playing Ali not here with them ?
That women is absolutely gorgeous 😍
After BTS, crazy rich Asians, squid game. Asians are making big in international market
🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷

므찌다 대한민국 사람들~  고맙다 세계인들~
⏺️🔼⏹️
Fun fact 456 won 45.6 billion won
They are all so charming! The acting is so amazing and it’s so unsettling and thought provoking. Korean dramas are such high quality, I hope people watch more and other genres too!
They r so humble!!
Eso loco!!!!!! Orgullosa de ellos😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
도무ㅏ 새ㅕ
Squid actors >>>>> BTS
The guy who play Sang Woo should get an Emmy for his performance. He play the character so masterfully making him the most hated man on the internet right now. 😆
WI HA JOON <3333
Jimmy: "No spoilers" Also Jimmy: "This robot girl turns her head around at Red Light and you get shot at if you're moving." 🙄
Wi ha joon's name is pronounce wrong…it's pronounced Wi Ha-joon as in “we” 👬 + “ha” 😂 + “june” 📆 and im not even kidding.  It's rly not that hard. Get the names correct pls…ik ppl can make mistakes but getting the names mixed up is just….🤦‍♂️In fact, he has the easiest name among all of them.
Lol I'd put that doll straight to the fire hahaha 😂 that or send it as a prank to someone lol
Squid Game is a global phenomenon
the girl's English so beautiful
Does Korean sound like Chinese to you guys?
Still can't get over Ali's death
dunno if this was edited, but the girl seemed pissed she didnt get much attention.   Awesome they are all.
Nice Korean People.💙💙💙❤
🌈👍
질문 자막점...
that was such a fake laugh
It's the best korean series go international
I feel so proud that korean things are  basically ruling the whole world...u know!?^#%#^# I'm so happy for that!!!!
Good!!!!!❤️
My kid got me hooked and I enjoyed every minute. Still confused about the ending. What would have happened if someone else won? Would they have played the last game with the old man?
Little irked he never directly asked Hoyeon a single question and she tried her best to be accommodating and answered in English but in general it's nice they get to speak Korean on an American talk show
If overrated had a name 'squid game ' 👀👄
Baby squid 🥺
I think what people like most about this show, is that they were able to turn something so innocent, childish and relatable and turn it into something so fearful we could literally sense the fear from a fictional screen. And the amount of time, various filming companies turned the show down but Netflix gave it a shot...it's just mind blowing that they planned this nearly a decade ago.
The series is so intense my body is trembling while watching
You guys are great!!! 😍😍🥰👍🏻
LOVE THEM
Playstation logo without x and fusion with money heist costume
The power of subtitles connects us.
I started watching squid game bc od xqc roblox video xd
Why didnt show ali
omggg BTW BY THE WAY HO-YEON JUNG OR SAE-BYEOK HAVE BEEN NOT ELEMINATED IT DINT SAY THAT SO SAE-BYEOK MIGHT NOT BE DIED!!!!
Why was Ali not there 🥺🥺❤️
THIS IS SOO GOOOODD
If you love Squid Game, why not watch another korean shows on netflix such as Mr. Sunshine. You will be astonished by the quality of the show in different viewpoints. It would definately be your one of the best shows ever!
Jennie introduced Squid game to me and now I'm in love with everything about it.
Love from Taiwan
They are very lovely
It was a good show...but my God that ending was HORRID!!!!
The Korean film and tv industry finally getting the attention it deserves!  I've been a long-time fan of their films and dramas and the quality (story and cinematography) just keeps getting better and better.
THATS AWSOMEE
Squid Game members seem nervous as they're participating in one of those games in the film. : )  Reading it, Mr. Jimmy Fallon tried hard to giving them green light for those 7 mins.
4:56 “No spoilers!” 3:20 “So her eyes are cameras, and if you move you get SHOT!”
He said no spoilers after fully talking about the doll 🙈
where is ALI? yall be racists
Squid Game is the best movie of the year!  Kudos to y'all! Can't wait for Season 2!
First Kingdom and now Squid Game! 🥰
Best show ever and the characters are legendary! ❤️👌
❤️😘 they are so great
Thank you Jimmy Fallon for being one of the few American talk show hosts and in my opinion the only late night host who is respectful and truly warm to Korean entertainers. THIS is how it’s done!!! Thank you Jimmy!!!
Wi Ha Joon!!! Im so prouudddd. Seems like 2021 is the year for you
Maybe someone can give you some money even if I'm just buying a cell phone that I'm going to use online class It's It's easy to break the old My cellphone
지나가다 들린 한국인 손🤚
Wheres ali?
He's asking questions in English and they are replying in their Mother tongue👏👏👏 We Indians will never dare to do that.
Kiccha sudeep kotigobba 3 trailer https://youtu.be/0TE83vJDvy4
와 진짜 국뽕 차오른다.  한국어 자막은 없지만 대충 알아먹을 수 있어서 다행이에요 ㅠㅠ
First parasite then squid game. We need more thrillers like that.
Jimmy said justice for Ali
why americans tv shows are so cringe
Jimmy Fallon always have very weird way to end the interview, like wtf is the clip have anything to do with the cast and what they have been talking about since the beginning xD
I love these people so much
Jung Hoyeon is so Freakin Beautiful 😍
Omg this show is famous worldwide
So proud of them all! They are all great actors
살다 살다 이젠 지미쇼에서 한국 스타들을 자주보네 오래살고 볼일이야 ㅎㅎㅎ
No spoilers but you already gave it away with the red light green light doll saying you get shot 😂
"Thank you so much for being here, not literally though."
surprised to not hear anyone say that this show was the driver's license of netflix
Let's see what korea have that's globally popular:   Kpop (BTS, Blackpink) Kdramas and Kmovies (parasite, squid game, the kingdom and many more)  Son Heung min Samsung LG  Hyundai Mukbang And many more things. As a consumer of K-enterteinament and a westener, my ego is so high and i'm so happy for Korea and Asia in general, bcuz it's a breath of fresh air for the world who were just used to American and European enterteinament, that's amazing keep ip up the good work korea! 👍🏼💜
Squid Games is overhyped by social media and koreaboos that have been brainwashed by Korean pop culture. People who have watched a lot of foreign movies know Squid Games literally plagiarised scenes from Alice in Borderland,  Kanji, As the Gods Will, Battle Royale, The Liar Game and the Chinese Animal World.  Don’t get me wrong Korea have made a lot of fantastic movies and dramas. But It’s so annoying that Squid Games have been soo overhyped and people claiming it was an ‘korean’ original idea. Dunno why Netflix listed it as an ‘original’ when it’s blatantly not.
Train to busan most definitely got me into korean movies/shows
Cho Sang-woo sends  Abdul Ali to Ellen show, He cheated him again.
Am i the only one who still not watch this kdrama?
Korean world domination💜💜💜
Why is the movie Parasite listed?
Naksss pati kay Jimmy nakarating squid game 💕
Could not believe how captivating it is, children's playground games with big consequences 😬So happy for them 🤗It's still number 1 here in Aussie!
I just love seeing diversity, this makes my heart so warm and i'm happy for them!!!
Omg it’s Jackie Chan
DESERVE
Its took 6 hours to watch this movie its 5:59am friday 10/8/21 I got done with it around 5:00am People who look for detail will know whats up after the first episode. But this isnt my type of movie my son brought it to your attention and he is 14 yrs old but he is into asian culture.
I cant wahit for season 2 😭😭😭😭
where is ali!?!?!!
They didn't pay attention when they attended English hagwon.
This show is getting crazy attention in Pakistan🇵🇰. Loved it!🇰🇷
I like how Jimmy said no spoilers but told us about the doll.
Jimmy learned things about them and asked such good questions!! and they answered in Korean! I LOVE this SO MUCH 💜
not me who still ships hoyeon and hajoon but end up getting broke heart after realizing they can't be together.  bawi next life, bhe.
They should also need to include ali with their guesting
she’s still saying girl *ger* that’s cute
I mean it's nice to see actors out of america or europe to get popular globally with native content but this show is insanely overrated i'm afraid.. it's filled with cheesy takes on human realtions and a very one-dimensional core message with extremely cartoonish villains
I am so happy for them all, such lovely people and fantastic actors!
How did they translate so fast everything both parts said?😂😭
Ho yeon is so gorgeous and so kind. I love her😍😍
Jimmy is litterly the most kindest and friendly person I have ever seen STAN A KING<3
the show makes one ask oneself who/what will one become when they are desperate and their own lives are at stake....
Please bring Ali for the interview too 🥺
Jimmmy : no spoilers guys  Also Jimmy : if you move on red light , the doll shoots you .
Where is Ali
everybody said jimmy fake laugh, I don't think so. I love this show! (to practice my listening LOL)
jung ho yeon is so beautiful
They should have invited Lee Byung Hun (The Front Man), he knows how to speak English as well 😌
I love these guys
"It's bigger than~" /change topic/ being careful right there Jimmy🤣🤣🤣
I love them😭😭😭
The amazing doll inspired by a local store in the philippines- the Julie's bakeshop
It's been a really long time since I've watched a drama that was fun and I couldn't breathe.
이병헌이 영어잘 하고 얼굴 더 알리려 나올줄 알았는데 안나온게 아쉽네 그래도 우리나라 배우들이 미국 유명 tv쇼에 초청 돼서 나온게 뭔가 신기하네
If the name of a game is a squid game then the prize is squid too? Is fried or nah? LOL
Haesoo is so cute omg 😭💞
Now this was a good interview. Thank you jimmy.
Where's Il-Nam
Okay! But they are all so beautiful 😍
Where is Ali?🥺
키야 멋지다잉
Park Hae Soo😍
Bae-byeok <3 LOL
❤️
So rasist !!! Whr is Ali anupam ???  Why k industry ??
참 이런 일이 다 있네
I really really really love kdramas. But I have always struggled to reme their names (except few actors and BTS) . M so glad Jimmy got the names correct coz I would have panicked🥺❤️
Ali is Missing!!?❤️ He had done a magnificent job in the series he should get recognition for his acting in this series 🙏
where are the jumpsuits and the doll?
I AM VERY VERY HAPPY THAT SOUTH KOREA IS GETTING RECOGNISED ALL OVER THE WORLD. THEY DESERVE THIS. FIGHTING....
omg kdrama actors in jimm fallon's show WOW!
Finally an American show finding time for translators instead of having the English speakers amongst the interviewed do all the work!
Korean Tv is some of the best stuff on Netflix, Far more interesting than the same old recycled dramas usually on there.
비기스트 텔레비젼 쇼 인더 월드라니... ㅎㄷㄷ..... 뿌듯뿌듯 물론 나는 사촌동생 넷플릭스로 봐가지고 보탬이 1도 안되었찌만...
Not a korean, but proud of them for still talking in korean language even though they are in america tv show. They never feel a shame to use their own language. One of the reason why i love korean and japan for still stand up for their own language.
A huge thanks to jimmy for always pronouncing the korean names nicely and swiftly ^_^
Sang-woo’s character may not be eveyones fav, but u cant deny that irl he is so nice 😊
저 특유의 텐션은 따라잡기 힘들긴 하지ㅋㅋ
Wow Sae Byeok speaks English really good!!!
Waiting for Alice in Borderland 2 i hope it will also get the attention it deserves .. Both are outstanding shows
They look excited AF And not me simping for all of them
지미 팰런 진짜 억지로 웃긴하네ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Cant imagine that korean drama can be a big hit not just in asia but all over the world.. Congrats to the  staff and to the director.. And all the actors and actresses.. They deserves to be popular..
Their voices though , sounds like MCs themselves.💛 SUCH A GREAT SHOW SO FAR, WATCHED IT IN OVERNIGHT.
Ali 🥲
No question for the lady? Why? I was fascinated by her character and the other lonely girl... And by the way, the idea for the show isn't new. Just to mention LIAR GAME manga that came years ago with very similar script.
한국어 찾고 있으면 추천 눌러라.
I am an Indian bro but still I m feeling so freaking  proud of them like dang maaan 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️
Lee jung jae 🧡🧡🧡
The creator of Squid Game Hwang Dong-Hyuk wrote the show in 2008 but was rejected by studios for 10 years! NEVER GIVE UP!!
No spoilers then spoils one of the most intense part of the guy being saved 😂
Where is Ali??? Why is not he included in the interviews?? 😡🤬
wait, what. i thought they all died, and wheres Ali?
Jimmy really did Bts and Army wrong.
korean content/movies are over the top garbage.  just go ask the japanese.
great questions.....
국뽕은 못참찌
Squid game is friendly reminder that if people were to read subtitles you’ll open yourself up to a WHOLE load of great tv/cinema.
1:38 why did he mix Korean with English Jigeum right now 🤣
한글 찾다 포기하고 돌아갑니다.😙
Heyoony 😭😭😭❤️
Entry of ali was awesome
Korea drama   wow!
I like their humble expression, My respect for them
Jimmy Fallon earned a lot of respect from after this interview, how he respected them and had a great conversation with them
이정재 사랑합다ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
It’s sad they didn’t have Ali there
What is that Set called that Jimmy have ?
Squid game powerrrrrr 💪⚡
KOrea
These people deserve everything that's happening to them. I'm in love with this show!
I really wanna watch it ....but honiiii😰 I'm trying to sleep at night😂😂✋😫
Where's alii
I wish Ali was there for the interview too 😞
218 WOO SHIESTY 😮‍💨😮‍💨
알리는?알리는? ㅎㅎ 다들 예쁘고 멋지다
중간중간 한국어 들어간 인터뷰 보는 거 좋다. 😆
Is it just me or does Jimmy looks like he doesn't treat them equally especially hoyeon?
Oh I love them so much! Congratulations guys, you deserve it!
한국인이라 자랑스럽네요^^
It's similar to Korea movie with daruma doll scene I forgot the title
BTS, Black Pink, Bongjoongo movie Parasite, Minari, and Squid game. Now is South Korea world 💜💜💜
I wish the interview was a little longer
Step aside Hollywood...bollywood...Kollywood....whatever  woods...here come the kimchiwood.
대박!! 지미쇼에서 당당히 한국어로 인터뷰하는게 다들 넘 멋지네요 ㅎ
i hope they Dont make Season 2, because the drama is too perfect as it is
Squid game is just so amazing! I'm so proud it got Famous soo fast!  And Hae soo saying" Right now "😂
YES!!!!
I wish wi ha joon had more talk time but let's hope for his time in full episode
K-Drama as well are good..
Still mad what he did to Ali
Squid game has gotten so big in such a short time
Love to see it. :) This was a nice interview. It’s good to see Americans getting more comfortable with subtitles and communicating with people who speak different languages. And cool to see Korean actors on a US talk show.
And because of squid game, i didn't bother to do my homework      I don't regret it.
If you haven't started the show yet and planning to watch - please skip this interview
I think, One of the reasons that popular korea wave in Asia... The height is higher and large body and Cool~.  18 years~28 years Man, Average height S, KOREA - 5 feet 9 (176cm),  CHINA - 5 feet 3 inch (165cm),  JAPAN - 5 feet 4.5 inch (165.5cm),  Thailand,Vietnam Etc. Southeast Asia - 5 feet 2.5 inch (159.5cm)
Nahh i prefer Kimmel
Korean alway make high quality movies...just this one popular in worldwide...i suggested u all watch korean movie even drama...they'll good
Jimmy is so awesome. I know he loves ALL the Korra culture, but I'm so happy he brought the cast of Squid game to his show 😍😍😍
spoiler alert........... ......... ...... .............. .......... .......... .... ...... ... sad most of the cast won't be in season 2 :(
Korea is good at everything ...... !!  Music,  dramas and everything in between
Ok but why was hoyeon not asked any valid questions about her character or her partaking in the film like wtf man
Jimmy’s so fake omg
Hoyeon is so gorgeous
I Watch the first episode last night and I really liked it. Then I came across this and I didn't know it was so famous. Me and Squid games cross paths after work....I love it!
God how i hate Jimmy's fake laugh
All the actors of Squid game is so cool and charming!! I love them!!!
Squid Games is disturbing but well done series, it’s good we finally get to see more international series like this being invested
"Baby Squid" thats so cute awww
not lying but my mother actually met sung-ki-hun the original character from squid game-
Wheres Ali
I'm so proud of them as a Korean. Its amazing that our culture is catching on throughout the world!! I haven't seen Squid Game yet tho🙄😅
한국어자막좀 달아주지..ㅈ
I love this seies,gonna watch it for the second time tonight!
As a south korean myself I love seeing korea being respected by so many countries. SO PROUD :)
should have brought Ali too...
I wish Ali was there too 😅 Thanks Jimmy Fallon for having them as guests 😍
This is literally giving me goosebumps 😂 everyone used to make fun of me few years ago because I love kpop so much
지미쇼에 출연하게 된 "오징어 게임" 배우분들 모두 자랑스럽습니다. 😍👍 "오징어 게임"을 보면서 많은 세계인들과 함께 웃고 눈물 흘릴 수 있어서 행복합니다. 💖🌍
I really love them 😍
Love the fact Jimmy study about people who came to his show unlike other host he knows what to ask and specially when it's Kpop/Kdrama most of American host ignore it and didn't know what to do so they will ask whatever, i'll really give Jimmy that 👏🏼
Jung ho yeon's English is pretty good ❤️
Mid
2:10 HIM SPECIFICALLY
HoYeon speaking English like a champ, she was waiting for this moment! So happy for all their succes 🔥
이야 .. 말이안나오네 자랑스럽네유
Korean shows work really hard at producing the best stories not only to their viewers but also for foriegn viewers. We hope for more to come 😊👍
I'm kinda feeling proud to see them
He was going to say something but stopped in the middle, "it's bigger than-" what Jimmy? Spill it, it's bigger than what? 😁
She speak english too! How perfect is she
Korea...plz...자막..부탁...plz
Jimmy : How can that face be a villain.   Korean actors : UHHMM... ITS COMPLICATED..
I wish Ali’s actor would be in interviews too 😭
They’re all incredible
Jimmy's interview was really outstanding!
KOREA IS TAKING OVER THE WORLD 😭🤯 and im here for it
한국의 삶자체가 외국에서 작품? 극단 치열 살벌 한국삶 아닌지 ...
When will we ever get to see Ali with the cast!??
Lee Jung jae I love you so much🥰💖
She is the definition of a “girl crush”
I have the biggest crush on that girl
Corea del Sur está dominado el mundo.
I hope it’s popularity doesn’t make it see any decline in quality.
I Love them 💜💜💜💜
Season 2 plzzzzzzz
It's amazing now how american interview shows accomodate non-english speaking countries. We have subtitles now! No language barriers! I love it! The world is evolving now 🥰 Being considerate with each other
His kids wathing this why did you kill her?!
Ooooo sqid game i know this about the games red light green light.
Is it more or does jimmy seem drunk ??!!
네분을 여기서보니 더 좋네요. 지미가 편협한 제임스와는 달리 조화로운 사람이기를 바랍니다.
Loved this show so much! 💙🗣
Asian represent!!!!
why did he completely ignore hoyeons existence in the interview and only give the interesting questions to the men 🤨
It's pretty awesome how much global exposure Korean cinema has received recently. There are a lot of amazing gems that are so underappreciated in the west, and I hope Squid Game will be the gate through which many will discover them.
Samajh me nhi aaya par sun k acha laga.. 🥲
They didn’t even ask hoyeon anything
Come on now. 🇰🇷 pride. Korean soft power at an all time high.
Where is Ali?
I really wish Hoyeon was casted to play Tokyo in the money heist remake 😩
Tell me you didn’t watch the show without telling me you didn’t watch the show.  Jimmy: Jung-jae, your the first person we meet in the show and your character is so charming and lovable. His character: Uses money to be spent for his daughter birthday and instead gambles and loses it.
Use me as the :Ali should have been invited button
Ali not being invited to the show is a big setback to your show Jimmy
Is it just me or the 3rd one looks a lot like Jungkook ? 🥰
This show is on par with ozark and breaking bad. Master piece!
I'm so used to seeing kpop idols on the tonight show that it feels strange to see Kdrama based actors on it 😂 I keep thinking its a Korean variety show and Jimmy guested as a host 😅
Wow #1 in 90 countries. That’s awesome!
Loved seeing them here in the tonight show!
YES THEY GETTING RECOGNITION
시즌2는 미국에서 만들자!!!!!
First time I watched Squid Game I was like, OMG what show is this?? It’s so goooooood and different!
First time I watched Squid Game I was like, OMG what show is this?? It’s so goooooood and different!
“No spoilers” WHEN U MOVE ON RED LIGHT, YOU GET SHOT!
Where's ali
Where Ali tho 🥺
WHERE THE HELL IS ALI
Nice
Korean Movies be hitting different. For me it started with "A Train to Bussan"
Ho-yeon is soo cute!
Where the hell is Ali ???? He is the star of that show haha the only character worth living
Season 2 in preparation!
한국배우가 나오니 신기하다. ㅜㅜ  Squid game! People all over the world enjoy watching it. I am grateful as a Korean.
한국인 모여랍
4:48 Jimmy fighting for his life just like dula peep did with Jimmy kimmel
I cant believe they had the cast of Squid Game on the Jimmy Fallon show. That's how big the show is...i love Jimmy Fallon. Always making the guest no matter who feel so welcome..
I like this lovely show!
So happy to see them❤
The interview would've been better if 'O Yeong-su' aka '001' and 'Anupam Tripathi' aka '199' were invited too.
The cast of this show are all so amazing, I'm so happy about the popularity this show is receiving!
Jung Hoyeon speaking straight English made my whole damn day😭✨✨✨✨
I bet Jimmy study all there name all night 😂😂
Finally, Wi Ha-Joon gets the limelight he deserved!❤️👏🏼👏🏼 When I started follow his IG he had 22k followers. Now 6.9M
❤️❤️❤️👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Korean shows are something, i won't be shock if korean entertainment would be the mainstream in the future
welp this was awkward for a sec-
Love Park Hae-soo dude had me rolling in Prison Playbook
Squid Game is legendary history of Kdrama with a huge perfomances. Feel very proud with all the cast. It's show Korean traditional game for around the world. Honestly, still can't move on ! It's ok if they can't speaking English by using native literally.
Squid Game is masterpiece and one of the best drama series I've ever seen.... When HoYeon speak English she looks so adorable and cute she is very gorgeous .. She is my one of my favorite Actress in kdramas
Do you know that lee jung jae dates samsung ceo's ex wife?
She is the cutest! ❤️
The director of Squid Games deserves every good thing rn for giving us such a masterpiece!
Kdrama Watchers to the world : Welcome to our beautiful world😍😂
Cant they speak english?
Jung Jae's laugh 😭😭😭
Where's ali
아니 이정제 진짜 개잘생겼네..
Y'all wheres Anupam Tripathi? :')
:)
Oh god 🔴🔺⬛
Iove them
이정재 본새 난다 정말
Nothing beats Jimmy’s fake laugh
I love how people are so shocked of how good Squid Game is but people who have been watching Korean films for a while are just used to this lmaoooo
BABY SQUID
The way she speaks English is so adorable
It's really quite amazing how popular South Korean entertainment is becoming. As a fan of kdrama since 2012, I honestly never expected something like this to happen but I'm very glad. I hope this isn't just a one time thing because it would be great if more people actually started to watch other k-dramas because they have so much to offer. From the amazing camera shots to the osts, kdrama and korean movies have so much to offer. I'm just hoping it doesn't go back to the way it used to be whereby people would tell me what I love and watch frequently is weird. Although I shouldn't have let people's opinions get to me, it did get suffocating after a while. Please do try watching some other k-dramas if you have the time!!
❤❤❤❤
Lee Jung Jae is already legendary in South Korea. He's someone like Christian Bale or Tom Hardy in US.  He basically has done every movie genres and can play any roles and he won major acting awards.
I’m so glad that people finally get to see how hot Lee JungJae looks in real life!
jimmy: no spoiler  also jimmy: showing scenes from the series🤨  anyway I watched it long ago, really loved it😌korean series are amazing, they are taking over😎
<888
she speaks english too?!
I LOVED this movie...exciting, funny, sad, brutal and brilliantly portrayed by very talented actors! More of the same please
내가 대한민국의 시민이라는것이 자랑스럽다
Up
아..한국어 답변 너무 좋다..
오징어게임이 이정도일줄은 몰랐다..
Jesus Christ, Jimmy Fallon is a horrible interviewer
Hallyu taking over hehe   cultural economy well done n.n
빛이 나는 한국 배우들♥ 자랑스럽습니다:)
Ali and the old man are being ignored everywhere. They were the stars of the show as well!
all chads
Hes laughing like kawhi leonard
Korean era…wow…I’m a British fan of BTS and slowly drowning in kdramas….I’m thrilled to see Squid games stars here
fake laughs as always
Okay… whoever put Parasite as the show on the description portion needs to be fired—
Jimmy is so fake he orobs watched 1 episode
I wonder how they are translating Jimmy's nervous talk in Korean
I love that they speak korean
Jimmy looks more nervous to me then the whole cast
Thank god, ACTUAL good questions!
온라인 출연
I’d love to se Lee Jung Jae and Park Hae Soon in like a buddy cop movie. Their on-screen chemistry is off the charts. And even during this interview.
No ones commenting on how Jimmy didn't ask hoyeon any questions and ignored her when she talked wtf
I'm so happy for this. ASIAN FREAKING REPRESENTATION Y'ALL LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!11111!!11!!1!!1
South Korea’s gonna win a culture victory at this rate
10/10 serie
오징어 게임❤️
Ho yeon her English uhhhh so cute
Jesus is your free gift to heaven when you believe in his death, burial and resurrection you are immediately saved.
Jesus is your free gift to heaven when you believe in his death, burial and resurrection you are immediately saved.
i love this , im so proud of them
한국사람?
I been watching foreign movies lately and comparing the films, korean, and so on have so much acting. I love their horror movies. Subtitles, dubbed whatever. I find it truly amazing how cinema in other countries can do alot more
She s just so beautiful and talented
Yes they're here!! Although I wish I could've seen Gong Yoo too🤧 wish he was a major character 😭
Me divertí viendo este video
Kdrama on tonight show? Perfect
This show is amazing I rarely watch koren drama but seeing the charcters that I connected with and cried during emotional scenes like the cast and actors are amazing and I definitely love the language it unique
Has Jimmy Fallon always been this obnoxious?! Literally unbearable
I wish Ali was there too
I love South Korean culture and language,  South Korean shows and movies, Korean food, Korean skincare, even Korean Air is awesome ✈️,  Incheon Airport my favorite, can’t wait to go back to South Korea 😍 🇰🇷
South Korea is on a massive run.
They’re taking over the US the same way the Beatles did in the 60s it’s crazy how much we love these guys
Possible spoiler alert:  Trust me Jimmy. You don't want to meet Sang Woo :)
BRUH HO YEONS ENGLISH IS SO GOODDDDD
The best squid games
Saebyeok...is smokin🔥
"Ssangmun Dong? Oh, that's not my name."
*Squid game is legendary.* WAITING FOR SEASON 2
how come they never invited ali on any interview like this. we want ali >:(
nice guy mr. lee and Jimmy Fallon
why tf was jimmy so weird, it even looks like his was nervous
so cute!
Super series ❤️ squid game 🔥
Wi Ha Joon, the actor who always seems uncomfortable and shy in an interview. But who still gives a lot of his. I love that ! Happy to see the Cast of Squid Game exported abroad. You deserve it! and Congratulations to Dad!
Jimmy! We want MORE!! 5 mins is not enough
The squid game that came out at the end of the episode is a really tough game. If you play this game, your clothes will be torn and you may get hurt.
When I was a kid, I used to play a game called 'Mother May I.' Then I taught my cousin's in Mexico how to play when my family and I went to visit. It's basically the same as 'Red Light, Green Light.' Korea is filled with masterminds that make incredible movies, series and music. Forever will be a fan. Much love. ❤❤
I am so happy that America is getting open-minded and enjoying all kinds of series, movies and music.... I am from India but I used to watch Kdramas since childhood coz we had northeast Indian neighbours.... I am so happy that everyone is recognising them...
When Jimmy was the only one that laughed . I felt that .
You should know exactly the "Red light, Green light" game from "The Squid Game". The rules for playing this game in Korea are as follows. 1. One blindfolded shouting "Red Light". 2. At that time, all but tagger moved to the tagger at once. 3. When the tagger shouts "Green light" . When the tagger looks at people, the person who moves is drawn towards the tagger and holds it with the little finger. 4. As everyone slowly approaches towards the tagger, he shakes the hand between the hostage and the tag and runs away again as a starting line. 5. Tagger catches one of them. 6. The person caught becomes the tag in the next game.
Anupam Tripathi should join them in interviews, he is such an integral part of the story.
Ho-Yeon speaking English was the cutest thing I've ever seen
They call his son Baby Squid🥺🥺
:John 14:6 “I am the way to the truth and the life. The only way to the father is through me”✝️- Jesus Christ❤🙏
The one in red is so cute. His smile 😍😍😍
I couldn't get through this whole interview because it was boring af, so I don't know if they're trying to say red light green light started in Korea but it DID NOT. And no country would even have traffic lights if not for Garret Morgan.
지미님의 한국배우 이름호명은 무척이나 감동적이네요! 완벽했어요! 굿!!!
It basically  Korean  R dominating world in music,movies n still more categories ... This is wt it is ....proud of them ...😇🙏
kenapa dorang x cakap english
Idk if it's the same anywhere else, but in Australia, kids are sometimes called "squids" or "squidlettes"
I’ve been watching Korean shows for years and its now just catching on I the U.S.
Yah! Why you didn't ask them!! If there's gonna be a second season or not!!!!!! Aaaaaaaaa what happened to hwang jun-ho cause he gets shot in his arms is he still alive!! Also what happened to gi-hun after he again gets the card! ><
crushing on Jung Ho-yeon
WE NEED TO INVITE THE DIRECTOR FRR
Oh my they are beautiful 😖😥
The Squid Game cast is great, but Jimmy makes me cringe.
Suid game is a better version of the saw lol
Gi-hun is so adorable 🥰
Why is the actor of Ali not there???
If u wanna give them credit then just skip Jimmy and watch the show. Their show is much better than Jimmy's whole career.
Menegang kan banget nonton squid game
OMGMMGMGMMMGMG
Luck film hindi
Great show 😁😉
good looking guys game....
Fact: this is Kim jong UN past time
Hell yes they are!
Where is ali
This show is good ngl
"Right now" I LOVE HIMMMM
Jung haeyeon Jennie proud of you 😭
Many of Koreans really want to share a clip from movie ; 관상 and how handsome Jeongje Lee is . I expected that but ..😂😂 there was a mention!!
I didn't know up to now that girl can change to a total different and opposite mood. She's looks tough in the movie but she looks innocent here. She's charming all the way.
HoYeon Jung supremacy
Que lindos!!
Congrats on #9 on trending!
Every koren actor looks like a part of BTS
What about ALI 😭😭😂😂😂....LOVE THEM ALL SO SO MUCH OMG
"jigeum right now" 😂
The strength holding a grown man up and not moving
Yooo that cop is like james bond level lol
South Korea is now taking globally from kpop, kdrama, movies, skin care and goods
Best series ever
I wish the actor that played Ali was there as well ;_;
People do not realize how big of a star Lee Jung Jae is. He appeared in some amazing movies.
This guy is the worst,he used trump when we all knew late night non funny host.doesnt matter who you vote just don't be a sell out douchebag
Jimmy kind of sucks as an interviewer he's mumbling and stuttering so much. I can't do any better but for him to be a famous interviewer it doesn't make sense
I'm so happy for the actors!! The series is incredible
Lol
Why did Jimmy laugh when said “if you move you get shot” 💀
No need to not spoil it I can’t watch it there is to much violence
This was a great show I also love the detail of how Sae Byeok talks to her brother with a North Korean accent and talks to everybody else with a South Korean accent. I can't tell the difference but it must have been a treat for Korean viewers.
I LIKE this PSYCHO-BOT.... 👧
Ha Jun got drip!
yo solo vine para ver a mi varon park haesoo qsyo
im addicted to Ho Yeon's laugh 😭
찌질한 모습만 보다  차려입은거 보면  놀라긴 하겠다 ㅋㅋㅋ .
ok
Where's Ali

can anyone tell me what hae soo is saying at 1:57?? i cant hear it properly lol
Can’t wait for session 2 😃😀
한국어로해라
Korean drama is so fabulous, moral and daring. All genre are there. Squid Game is suspenseful and will blow your mind. I can't wait to finish and I be sad when it's over. Watch it.
I wish Anupam was here with them. He really left an impact.. iykyk
This show has just swallowed all of us whole. So funny and awesome.
I remember to have seen the movie "New World" which was Lee JungJae starred. I was inspired and energized! Kudos on an outstanding job about K-pops, K-dramas and K-movies!
very cool movie or series! the girl is very pretty. hopefully my wife doesnt see this comment(:
when she speaks English well 😩
this the Chinese will never be able to do!  congrat Korean people!
https://youtu.be/CJurtNdC8KI
I love them all. What a crazy a** show but very true on how far people will go for money...
Yes. It was so weird seeing Lee Jung Jae in a role that wasn't serious.
Lee Jung-jae has been dating with Samsung vice chairman's ex-wife for more than  7 yrs.
not the directors tho? ok
Love the show and cast but also love that Jimmy says no spoilers while giving away spoilers lol
Ride that Hallyu wave S. Korea! Squid games was amazing. Had to binge watch it! Kamsahamnida
I love that S. Korea is exporting so much greatness!
literally didnt ask ho yeon any questions...
Atleast props to Jimmy for trying his best to pronounce Korean names properly 💕
I love them soo much 🥺🥺🥺 I would love to see more of them in interviews or even work together once again in the future !! 💗
they’re all so sweet and cute
LEE JUNG JAE IS SO ADORABLE!! we love you. 😍😘💕
I love Squid Game!!! Best show!!!
If your'e a boy click the show more                  you had a crush on Jung Ho-yeon ;)
I am so happy for them and this series. It was absolutely phenomenal. I must watch more Korean movies and shows.
WHERE IS ALI??
It is so very nice to watch. The guests speaking korean in an american show and here I am neither an american or korean liking that this diversity is being normalize in tv.
실화냐?
Squid games reminding me a lot of Alice in borderland.....
I remember the days when kdramas were so unknown and I would look all over the internet for English translated shows. Look how far we've came.
I am literally so happy for them!! I feel so proud to see these casts on this show. This is really a proud moment for Korean actors, although they are already popular but now through this show they will get more recognition than ever!! Korean drama actors deserve all the love and recognition because they are super talented and have amazing personalities too!!
Great cast ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
When she said the robot name and then said she’s the one🥰
It so hard because I know you so little Korean and more Japanese
1:38, hello park jeongseong
우아대박~
LOVEEE
I love her voiceeee omg 😍😍😍😍😍
fact:Preparation for squid game started 12 years ago.
Kakek ilnam kontil
I just realized that the show made how much the prize money was
너무 좋다!^_____________________^
Is it just me or every korean guests that are in american shows are extremely awkward?
I really appreciate Jimmy calling their names the Korean way (family name first then first name) rather than the Western way (first name first then family name).  Very respectful. I haven't seen anybody bother to do that when interviewing Korean people before. This was great. The show went well, good questions were asked and the actors and actress were all so wholesome. :) I hope many more hidden Korean gems get attention....I've been pretty much watching their stuff since Train to Busan and it's a delightful rabbit hole  😀
They look the same. Who is who
Soon Ma Dong Seok is gonna appear on American Shows aswell
오우 쉣 ㅋㅋㅋ
WHERES ALI? I WANT TO SEE ALI!
Hae Soo 😍😍😍
Squid game is a masterpiece ✌️
Squaid game is just Masterpiece  My favourite Kdrama  The actress and actors  acting is just Awesome Im addicted to this series
God doesn’t want anybody in hell because He loves us, but you must understand why we deserve hell and why those who refuse to live under His authority will go there. He gave us the law (Ten Commandments) not to make us righteous, but rather to show us our sin (Romans 3:20). We’re not sinners because we sin, but rather we sin because we’re sinners. Sin is the nature of our flesh that we are born with due to the sin of Adam in the garden. For someone to be justified before God they have to be sinless. We’ve all sinned (Romans 3:23), and the the law demands death for those who sin (Romans 6:23). God is righteous, so He must punish our sin, which is what He did through His Son Jesus Christ on the cross. Jesus is Holy and sinless, yet He received our sin when He died on the cross, so that we can be righteous before God (2 Corinthians 5:21). When He died on the cross, He said “It is finished” (John 19:30), which means He paid the full price for all of your sins (past, present, and future) to be forgiven. He was buried and rose again from the dead. God will forgive anybody who puts their full trust in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. We aren’t saved based on our good deeds, but only by the grace of God (Ephesians 2:8-9). His precious blood that He shed is the only reason why we can be forgiven of our sins (Hebrews 9:22). If you confess that Jesus is Lord and believe that God raised Him from the dead, then you’ll be saved (Romans 10:9). You are born-again with the Spirit of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17), and are not only legally justified before God, but also are accredited His righteous (Romans 4:24). Believers live for Christ now, so get to know Him through His Word. I recommend reading the book of Romans and the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), and watching Pastor Joseph Prince’s online videos!!
Nice to meet them. 👍🥰🥰🥰🥰👏👏👏👏
baby wi ha Jon I love you so 😘❤I love
They should include Ali
"and when she says green light, she turns around and when she says red light and her eyes has cameras and if you move, you get shot" 3:22 Come on guys, no one rewatches this before uploading?! So much for "No spoilers" 😒 You have one job JIM!
Lee jungjae is the only one who didn’t speak much English but still very funny. Ho yeons english is so cute
what an applause haha, so cute, not western at all
Far away the best worldwide series of the year. The cast, the director and the storytelling are outstanding. An instant cult classic.
Jimmy looked very excited to meet them. Like he is really excited.
You should pay attention this seen if you wanna know actor Leejeongjea (Gihoon) more  https://youtu.be/UpsNxhGx-2g You might be overpowered like so many Koreans!!
stop stuttering you unfunny alcoholic
all koreans are mainstream these days
Jimmy Fallon is the worst
HoYeon is so amazing! <3
Sang-woo is so cute although he is a bad child-hood friend ^^ in squid game he is still so admirable!!
I didn't know that HoYeon can speak english😭💖
jimmy: no spoilers also jimmy: proceeds to only bring the cast that die off in the show
믓찌다 믓찌다 우리 호연언니🤍 국뽕이ㅠ차오르는군
CONNECTED TO LIFE IS THE GAME ITS WHAT IT IS NOW KILL EACH OTHER.  ALL ABOUT MONEY 💰
I prefer his messy looking hair than the clean cut😁
Fallon is so fake and annoying
I like jimmy… 8 cant sense any fakeness of him during interviews esp with koreans
Ok lets just talk about how pretty her shoes are like I LOVE THEM
2:16 best part of the whole vid😍😍
In the show I hated Sangwoo SO MUCH and now I see the actor talking about his son and I 🥺🥺🥺 such an amazing actor that made me hate his character but in real life he's very nice
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺💙💙
ho yeon can have my kids
"When did u realize the show became so big?"  "Right now." That was amazing梁梁
WOW JIMMY PRONUNCIATION OF THEIR NAMES ARE GOOD ENOUGH!! 😍
😍😍😍😍😍😍
오버하넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
The girl (sorry I don't know her name) she knows English
everyone talking about hoyoen and jung jae but I'm just here admiring hajoon's smile and cute actions which most people missed 🤤
I love this cast. 😍
Gi-hon
My baby daddy Wi Ha-joon, thanks you all.....lmao He is sooooo finneeeee
Hi-
It's deserving to be number 1. South Korea making amazing shows and movies
Not to gatekeep but i hope the west doesn’t influence kdramas like it is starting to kpop😅. We like them because they’re korean😭.
never thought I'd see the day 무궁화꽃이 피었습니다 is discussed on jimmy fallon lol
Jimmy Fallon is such a bad and fake host he makes it look so obvious
Anyahaseyooooooo
Wow
"They play red light, green light and the psycho robot kills u if u move.....Oh and no spoilers in here", Jimmy Fallon
Wow, his son was born 10 minutes before the show went live? That kid must be like the Jesus Christ of tv shows.
The police guy is so hot!! Too Bad he died
I can imagine that Jimmy Fallon as a squid game contestants
오징어게임(squid game) 이렇게 흥할줄이야
Jimmy F*ckin Fallon just showed a huge scene! right after he said he won't do any spoiler.
Am I the only one who feels so happy and relieved to see the casts are all alive and healthy? I got so attached with each character and felt emotional with the death scenes in the movie. I loved the song 'Fly me to the moon' even more because of Squid Game. Hoping for the next season! <3
Korean and Netflix are like PB&J, they belong together.
Title says squid game  YouTube: ah yes parasite I know that one!
Lee Jung-Jae is  one of the most handsome Korean actor. You guys should watch movies 관상 (The Face Reader), 암살 (Assassination), 신세계 (The New World).
This made me so happy and emotional! Loving Asian pop culture as a Westerner has been a niche for decades and seeing Hallyu actors on a US talk show is mind-boggling. Really glad to see pop cultures coming together. Thank you Netflix, thank you Jimmy Fallon and The Tonight Show.
How does he understand Korean?
Imagine being one of those other production companies that turned down Squid Game. I bet they're regretting it now! Netflix is so perfect because it can get away with more nudity, gore, and violence than public television, and it is more accessible to worldwide audiences.
What the hell are there names  it is So weard
Jimmy Fallon as usual having that fake laughter
Damn that audience is dry af…
번역판 내놔
This is mind blowing! Seeing not only API people on popular media like Simu, but actually seeing straight up 100% Korean actors on Fallon!? So proud to be Korean in this day and age.  Jimmy could definitely relax on the pronunciation, Korean's a very "pure" vowel language, almost no dip thongs or extremely fast ones. Jung Jae sounded too much like Chong Jay. Hae Soo's Hae is like the first syllable of Helen, nice and short.
This is my first time ever watching an Korean show and I fell in love with each character
Don't want to show Ali? Just Saying...or no spoilers?
❤❤❤
Watch western actors flock to the Korean film industry
4:51 gets the award for the fakest laugh on Air😂
This is the first show ever where i love the entire cast 🔥
Omgggg
Jimmy you did great job with this interview 👏👏👏
jimyy actually looks genuine in this one
That fake laugh of jimmy thooo hilarious
Shoutout to Jimmy for being such a great host for international idols, actors etc. He doesn't ask mainstream questions and you can tell he does research to get to know the celebrities before they come on the show. I've seen so many interviews with American hosts and they ask questions that can be found literally all over the internet (so if you are a fan of the group, show or individual, you aren't learning anything new about them) or they don't even try to identify the international guests by their names. They just point or gesture to them. It's so refreshing to see Jimmy interact with international guests. We love and appreciate Jimmy <3 #besthostever
So proud of Korean actors and films.
I forgot this was coming wtf wtf
Baby squid! 😍😍
I’m sorry but they did my guy Ali WRONG 😤😤
Baby squid 🦑 sooooo cute 🥰 Love squid game 👍👍👍👍👍
NICE
B
It’s huge here in Canada 🇨🇦 congratulations guys!!! 🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
너무 자랑스럽다 우리 나라 배우들 너무나도 사랑스럽다 ❤️❤️
Kim Jong Un must very be proud right now
Squid game is an intense series on Netflix...👍
I'm mad Alice in borderland didn't get the same hype. It is significantly better. Although this show was good and not horrible by any means. But its absurd at this point how people feeding into the hype can project the shows hype even more.
awesome
I LITERALLY SAW HO YEON POSTED THIS ON HER INSTAGRAM AND I SCREAMED- 😭👍🏻
I love it just got done 😊
jimmy fallon is pretty fake
U should have call ali as well... I guess his english might b badass
Porque no sale la chica que jugó con la actriz principal?(no se sus nombres ) :(
bakit walang pusit sa squid game?
Lmao Fallon saying he’s not doing spoilers but then spoils how the red light green light game works lmao
I love this cast
Man, they did my boy Ali bad in the show and also in the interviews.. he was just as integral as these 4 characters. I would argue he had a bigger role than the policeman.
yeah id call my son baby squirt as well
they are premium actor, actress now
😍😍
한국어로 번역해주실 능력자 계십니까?
omg i love it
ALIII :(((((((
hoyeon 😍😍😍
joe KIM
Great to see Korean shows and culture blowing up worldwide in part to this show. But i must say, Jimmy Fallon seems like he is faking his emotions and talk so much. So so fake and cringy to me. Just seems all like an act
I like how they talk in their own language
Que hermosos se ven todos 😍
i hate how he didn’t ask hoyeon any questions. but when he asked the other actors, he addressed them by name.
"I know that you are famous in Korea for playing a villian'  Jimmy did some background check considering they are foreign guests is awesome 👌
Jimmy botched their names so hard gosh...
I'm sorry but  where is the person who played Ali ? 👀
we see kpop idols often on late night shows, but I didn't expect to see kdrama actors. proud of the progress and proud to see kdramas doing so well internationally 😍😍
Jimmy is so cringe
OMG!!!
hoyeon needed a direct question from jimmy :/
Haven't watched it but sounds like Korea is influenced by Japanese manga.
.
Jimmy is the best of the best ever.... great man. 👍
I was sad that that was just a skype video. I thought the cast came to the set
best series ever, it was thrilling and unpredictable.We want season 2 as soon    as possible.
They copy the same pattern with SAW and Alice in Borderland. Whats so special? Overrated and overhyped just because korean fan boy
연기파배우 이정재! 그가 초콜렛 광고에 모델로 처음 나왔을때 알아봤지! 진짜 대단한 사람이 될거라고!! 항상 응원합니다!!
Such a charming team of actors and actresses
I love how Jimmy act when one each other just speak with their native languages. He just know how to control the language barrier
👶🏻🦑
Anyone else who wants a second part ?🔥
WOO SHIESTY THAT'S MY DAWG, BUT WOO YOU KNOW I REALLY SHEISTY
يا جماعة في احد غيري لما تابع المسلسل اذكر انمي القناص ؟ نفس الشي العاب وجزيرة وناس تنقلب على ناس واسرار 😍
Eww what's wrong with Jimmy? H÷ is a bit weirder than I remember
Iba talaga si Darren espanto hahaha
I’m soooo in love with Hae-soo 😭😭😭😭
No spoilers? You just gave people away that the players are shot when they play red light green light Jimmy 😬 I was shocked to see it now you took it Jimmy 😅
Does Jimmy know Korean? Cause after the actors say something in Korean he answers/continues the conversation as if he knows what they are saying
Wi Ha Joon is one of the most attractive men I have ever seen. 10/10 gorgeous perfection in every single way
Not to be that person but how do you pronounce wi ha joon’s name?😭
Crazy that Hoyeon's first drama is such a huge success. Im so proud
we are the GGanbu haha.
I enjoyed Squid Game.  Definitely worth the hype.
Yo... where's my boy Ali? 💪😤😂
Jimmy is smart and really banking in on the Korean Wave.
I love jimmy’s fake laugh🥰
3:53 wow her English is actually very good!
Wi Ja Hun 😍😍😍
I know Jimmy was sweating pronouncing the names
an example of each characters personal journey (aka spiritual awakening/existential crisis) evolution of self -  I love it - we all have a journey - hope mine ends with the whole victory of love, family and happiness
It's on trending
👏🏻Awesome cast! Super talented 🤩💪🏼
Honestly, seeing korean actors/celebs on american talk shows really makes me realize and appreciate the skill, wit, and eloquence of korean show hosts (like YJS), bc american talk shows got nothing on them
BABY SQUIDDD
HoYeon has been working very hard on her English and it shows! That was great. It's almost as if she is learning with an American accent compared to most second-language English speakers who seem to learn from English teachers or maintain their own respective regional affectations. Similarly Americans learn different "accents" or dialects of Spanish based on which country they plan to be visiting. Anyway, great for her! Good stuff! So happy for their success. They are all so humble and talented!
Jimmy’ laugh from 4:52 sounds so forced 🤣🥲
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Jimmy fake laugh is scary lol
If you guys love Park Hae soo, watch Prison Playbook..
baby squid awww
I shop 069 and 218
Wait these guys are still alive?
No spoilers he says 😂 and just told everyone the doll shoots people which is the opening game
우린...GGANBU잖아.., !
For baby squid❤️
🥱
Jimmy is all of us with genuine joy to hear their interview 😂❤️
South Korean contents and products are popular in Asia and Europe. Finally it is the time for American Continent. Samsung, LG, Kpop, K-Drama, K-Beauty, K-Entertainment, Movies are popular around the world. Lastly Hyundai, Kia, Genesis are the nest products to earn popularity in the world.
No no no, this is all wrong, you're supposed to give us Korean James Bond, it's the only way to make white audiences watch, not by writing original stories with compelling plots and developed characters, it'll never work...
Fakest laugh ever 😂😂😂
It is so heartening to see a more dynamic depiction of Asian people on screen. I think this show is doing wonderful things in terms of showing the public that Asian characters are real people and not just one dimensional stereotypes. What a gorgeous cast. I love them 🥺
why it say parasite tf LOL
3:50 bro if u r an engene u would know  lol     Nishimura chulsoo Ni-Ki ahhhh....
❤️
jimmy asks everyone questions except Jung Ho-yeon
나는 지미팰런 아저씨 포함해서, 미국 인터뷰를 방탄 꺼만 150개 정도 보다가 오징어게임 출연진 꺼 보니까, 적응이 안된다. 이렇게 물어보는 거만 잘 대답하고, 개그랑 장난도 안치고, 그렇다고 텐션이 낮지도 않은데 차분하게 인터뷰 받을 수도 있는 거구나…! ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ 이게 정상인가! ㅋㅋ
https://youtu.be/jnGyN80LWjg
4:52 jimmy what the fuck
Who would actually play squid game in real life? 🙋‍♀️
Wi ha joon I love you  😘❤❤❤
I proud that im korean🇰🇷  Korea movie fighting
The only time I will ever watch Jimmy Fallon
I loooooove squid game 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Omg so proud of them!! Way to go!😍😍😍
한국인 없누
spoiled the whole first episode???
Listening to the Fly to the moon will never be the same.
She's so absolutely gorgeous
LOVE but Alice in Borderland is a similar premise and deserved this much attention too!
🌸If you’re reading this 🌸let me wish you LOVE JOY PEACE DIVINITY BLESSINGS x 1,000,000 in every area of your life!🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸.
Lee Jung Jae smile was so cute🥰🥰🥰
Korean language sounds really sexy in real life
Good
주모!!
Yes omg wihajoon
hollywood should take notes... oh wait.. nevermind
Alguien que hable español o soy la única? ;-;
지미팰런 많이 컸다 오징어 게임이랑 인터뷰도 하고      .... 아 이게 아닌가? Zzzzzzz
AHHHH
Koreans make better movies and tv shows.
할배 어디갔누 ㅠㅠ
Jung Ho-Yeon 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 goshhh she is gorgeous, perfect, stunning, talented
ILOVEYOU JUNG HOYEON 💕💕💕
Jimmy talks too much
Okay really appreciate him pronouncing their names like a bosssssss 😎
Look at them all cleaned up! So gorgeous! 🥰
omg when he stepped onto the dead body
My man berlin
I'm so sad I never see Ali's actor in interviews :'(  he was a side character but i still loved him
Damn I just realized that guys son is going to see his dad kill a couple of people on screen and be the bad guy 😂
BTS has their ARMY, BlackPink has their Blinks now Squid Game have Baby Squid.
지미 브라더~  오늘 처음봤는데, 사람이 아주 진국이구먼..
I’m so happy for Korean creators. I have a special place in my heart for Korean culture since 2006.
Korean films and tv shows are just incredible and on another level!! I love this cast and can’t wait for more.
Amazing series
Jung Jae is so handsome! That deep voice wow! ❤️
오징어 게임은 내가 본 최고의 시리즈였습니다!! ... 지미 팰런은 그들이 한국어로 무엇을 말하는지도 몰랐고 그냥 흐름에 따라 가고 있었습니다 하하.
The grrrr
팰런쇼 돈 좀 더 써서 더 큰 티비 놓자...
Where is Ali??
Where is  Ali? I wanna see Ali interview~~~
BRO I LOVE THEM ALL SO MUCH
Bruhhh nowww I gettt, I always saw on tiktok the trend they would stop then when a certain song came on they would dance and then they would get shot... now I get it. I only watched the first episode and got bored but now that I see this ima go watch it😭😭
Hoyeon sounds amazing 😩
I'm so glad they  came out on the show!
Where is ali?
When Jimmy pronounces Korean names better than Oli London
They should have included the indian guy in the interview too.
Hae Soo is also on a really well made Netflix series called “Prison Playbook”! Please go watch it!!! I’m sure everyone who loved Squid Game would also love it!!
It's 이정재  not 이청재 and not 이쩡재 😡
너무 자랑스럽당~~^^
i wish ali was here
Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Jaeyong's wife is currently dating Lee Jungjae. The child raised by Chairman Lee Jae-yong at the time of marriage will be called Lee Jung-jae's father.
Actress got no questions and she’s the baddest character in the show
It's so cool to see them in Jimmy's show! Hope in the future we can get more of them and from the Korean culture in US shows!
YouTube: yeah this is Totally about that movie called parasite
💜
Can't imagine Squid Game Season 2 without Kang Sae-byeok.  Her death was so unfair.
the cast is likeable uwu
>https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzAUj5DNHXSkV2jxoRVVlyohxphQK-S9R
Jung Ho-Yeon’s English is great
They all look so good😍
They're so amazing I loved the serie and I expect there's a new season plz. also #1 here in Brazil
Omg ya u could've spoiled I seen all episodes
Org korea kecek korea, org barat kecek barat, org portugal kecek portugal, ore kita try hard gune BI
YAAAAAASSSSSS KOREANSSSSS IN THE HOUSEEEE
Thank you for having subtitles. We have come so far from before.
why did he ask every one of them a question/2 questions but asked zero questions to the girl? I don't like that >:(
Why PARASITES??
Haesoo is so adorable 😭
South Korea is doing big things man. Bravo 👏
The north is probably hating HARD!!! You know damn well Kim jung un has already watched this and is pissed the south is outdoing em
Everything about South Korea sounds cool
I wanna go to South Korea so bad, definitely not north but for sure south HAHA
Why Ali and the old guy not included in all interviews? They were main characters as well
I have watched it 3 times...its really good!!!!
I love it! Awesome cast, even more awesome show!!! If you haven't watched, what are you waiting for?!
"right now" QASDHASDHSDHASJDJS😭😭💖💖💖
At first I thought the main character was a low life, dead beat dad, bum, no good son, hobbo. But by the end he was a Hero. And I loved his character as a person so much.
Let’s go Kdramas, Kmusic, Kmovies, Kbeauty. Everything, just take over please. I’m all for it.
WHY IS JIMMY STUTTERING SO MUCH LOLLLL no hate tho hehe
오징어게임 진짜 흥했네
Jimmy is more aggressive with his expressions than Korean actors 😆
Jimmy Fallon has the fakest smile ever omg
펄 럭 !
Wah, handsome all the actor
What did he say, I couldn’t understand him. 👊🏼😜
I love their energy and spirit of goodness
to be honest, i was impressed as i watch squid game its so realistic and very honest to the point its somehow a perfect show
he didn't ask hoyeon a single question :/ should've asked her about how this is her first acting role!!
오징어게임 명대사  1. 밖에 나와 보니까 여기가 더 지욱이야  2. 너는 여기서 나갈 이유가 있지만 난 없어  3. 사람은 믿는 건 믿어서가 아니라 기델데가 없어 그런거야  4. 아직도 사람을 믿나?
What’s the girls name
Jajaja entendí casi nada
Brother Jimmy
I feel like jimmy would be a VIP
I love how jimmy just keeps talking like he knew what they were saying
it’s crazy how i legit knew nothing about korea like 5 years ago and now we have so many movies, tv shows, and music from korea!!!
I haven't watched that yet :(
I didn't expect this but it my day a lot better.
WHERES ALI😡🥶😫
I hope no one forgets their names. Excellent cast.
When Jimmy says "he saved you! I love it!" at the end I couldn't help but remember Caesar Flickerman at the hunger games just loving everyone dying lmao
These are really good questions!! Thank u jimmy 🥺
'PSYCHO ROBOT' 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Ive been watching in English dub and it feels like none their voices match bc im hearing their real ones for the first time lmao
WHERE'S ALIIII??!?!!?!
정재를 하드빌런이라 소개 ㅋㅋ =악당,악역 ,  정호연 외모도 성격도 매력있네!
Every single interview with Koreans. They are all awesomely humble, unlikely‘it’s me me me’
I recommend the movie Slashers if anyone is interested in older horror. It's about people competing in a killer contest for movie. Great indie flick.
https://youtu.be/TpeCao-a-7I
Baby squid 🥺
They turn childhood game into horror. The truth here is that, you got yourself in some debt and this seems like your only way out is to play the game fairly and don't break any rules, or you'll be 'eliminated.......The Frontman
Ayo we 456 gang round this bitch if you fuck wit 218 you’re opp
https://youtu.be/xc61U1aFkik Cast react to their own show
Title: Squid Game actors on Jimmy Fallon Movie recommendation: *Parasite*
Wi ha joon in red ✨💳✨💳✨💳✨
I wish this interview would have been longer ❤️❤️ I love them all!!!!
This show was so freaking amazing and I look forward to season 2
Yea imma say jimmy ain’t watch the show 💀 based on his reaction of the last clip lmfaoo
Go and watch our Gi Hun starred in the 2013 gangster hit New World. It's another masterpiece from South Korea. It actually make The Departed look like child play (pun intended).
i mean yeah it was a decent show and i didnt hate it...but ill never get the insane reception this show has gotten. its like battle royale meets wheel of fortune. definitely not super groundbreaking story and if you want the gritty realistic horror part there are better options out there with a far more compelling story. more power to em though i guess. its crazy how popular this got
At this point, I'm sure Jimmy knows a few Korean words off the top of his head 😂
love u and them especially hoyeong jung <3
Jimmy is the besttt
games like this are really real in real life they put all the real bullshit in movies so you wouldnt see past the idea that its just a silly movie
Where is Ali
We're in the Squid Game...
I wish Anupam Tripathi, the actor who portrayed Ali was in Jimmy Fallon's show
6.32 back in five seconds...... what is this towards???
Hoyeon Jung is an angel ❤😇
ho-Yeon is soo damn fine bruh and she speak English well, I want her bruh she a W!!!
Waiting for season 2
😃😍😍😍😍😍😍
squid game is the shit. i finished 9 episodes of em
Jimmy: “no spoilers, I’m not gonna give any spoilers”   Also jimmy: proceeds to show a clip from the show
so they didn't actually die bruh
No, whats captivating us isn’t the games it’s YOU ☺️😻
I really wish they could’ve added the Ali guy to this interview. He was amazing
This is my first time Seeing Jimmy nervous and Stuttering 😭
We need a season 2 😭🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦
Booo, you cut out Ali
Jung Hoyeon is So FINE BROOO 😭😭
R.I.P. Ali
Jung Jae got me feeling some type of way
Jimmy is the fakest guy I know
I love Lee Jungjae!!! He has great smile!!
I survived this depressing Corona period because of Kpop, Korean dramas& movies lol. Thank you South Korea. You saved me
Hello my name is sangwoo Lee from South Korea. I sometimes watch this show and  I'm really proud of them 😁 as jimmy mentioned the villain , if u want to watch Lee jung jae villain role I highly recommend the movie face reader to everyone around the world.  I still can't forget Lee Jung-jae's performance of King Sejo. It is totally different character between squid and movie 😂
so humble and sweet man
Sorry to say it but Americans are running out of ideas writing scripts on making movies and the asian movies are dominating netflix. Facts! American are movies are now boring and vanilla same crap over and over..
Please watch the Lee Jung Jae 's other movie calls "Gansang" it's amazing movie with Lee Jung jae
The Lake House was the remake of this K-movie.  Lee, Jung Jae was the main character.   https://youtu.be/YpysBtYMz2I
ok but where is ali?
4:54 Jimmy for the love of god stop with that fake laughing wtf lol
i remember hajoon from romance is a bonus book, ahh i love his acting so much!
Easily My favorite show on Netflix can't wait for season 2 to drop😍🥺
Yes, Korean cinematography is exceptional. I'm really thankful to Netflix, they bring so much to this platform. Finally I don't need to download it via Torrents. Still we need more good movies and series coz they're out there! I love the actors
where is ali
best thing about the whole interview, they understand english perfectly fine but prefer to speak in their native tongue!! loved it.
This is one of the best shows I have ever seen. Acting, story, everything is so good. Please Netflix, if you make season 2, don't ruin the show!
THEY LOOK SO EXPENSIVE ❤
Jimmy couldn't be more fake here, so cringy
Y'all need to watch Kingdom too.
철수랑 영희 캐릭터 교과서에 얼마나 오래 써 먹은거냐 ㅎㅎ
Squid game has gotten so big in such a short amount of time, it’s pretty impressive.
He didn't ask the woman any questions! We would have loved to hear from her more.
OMGG
Incredible to see a South Korean cast be featured on American late night. Proud To be Korean these days.
Theyre so beautiful
k I freaking adore them lol
i love how excited jimmy was to talk to them
He became a dad... and Wi Ha-joon became a daddy. How cute!! 🥰
if you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, hated, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.  God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16 Love Y'all
I hope this really introduces more people into kdramas because South Koreans way of storytelling is honestly phenomenal it's upt my standards for tv shows
How can you not like the cast
They did an amazing job. My second fav to Breaking Bad.
We're living in interesting times.
Aj8h
Squid game is basically a Mr Beast video on steroids 😅
I want Season 2 with them 😭😭😭
Awww Baby Squid, Aegi Squid
they are so damn humble, humile kind, i am melting! 🥺🥺🥺
squid game cast is so wholesome :(( i love them especially wi ha joon 🥺🥰… i’m being a simp rn
I hate that they only released this with just one season in the bag. I binge-watched this in 2 days and was sad that there wasn't a 2nd season yet. LOL!
we need an anime adaptation of squid game.
jimmy is so fake kek
I like how jimmy didn’t laugh when our villain said “ jimmy brother “
I wonder why Anupam Tripathi who plays Ali doesn't do any interviews with the cast considering he's one of the main character.
I think it would be a cool thing to put in squid game 2 (If they even make a second one) or a series very similar that a winner from one game keeps coming back every year. almost like he is addicted or is trying to make the games boring for the VIPS by him always winning.
why did I have a feeling Jung Ho-yeon's english would be decent? I knew nothing of her before this interview btw.
Bro I swear that was the only thing I watched that made me actually cry
너무좋다 한국배우들이 유명한쇼에출연해서
OG!
Drama é tudo de bom, pra quem gostaria de assistir outros doramas recomendo The Devil Judge, Flower of evil, Itaewon Class, It's okay not to be okay, Movo to Heaven (super premiado)
This show was so over hyped and boring that I didn’t even finish ep 1and I don’t care if anyone spoils it. When something is overhype like a show or movie I don’t care if I get spoiled cuz you’ll hear it every where. I’m just here cuz I don’t have nothing to watch so I just watch stuff from trending
Korea
i LOVE THIS!!!
America and Americans now live around south Korea and Korean, even the ads are now about Korea that depressing
omg
I wanted to see Jung Ho-yeon talk more, but Jimmy failed me!!   Ugh!  How about another show with Jung Ho-yeon as his guest!!!
First BTS now this cast. Jimmy is really the nicest out of all the American talk show hosts. That's why he's so likable and all the Korean companies choose him for interviews.
OMG SQUID GAME
Koreans are getting A LOT of recognition from BTS getting grammys, to Parasite and Minari getting an Oscars, to Squid Game.
4:52 that’s the fakest laugh I’ve ever heard
*Such an amazingly gracious group of people.* I'm happy that Squid Game has been a massive success.
baby squid that's so cute!
omg so the police officer dies just like that? i just remembered </3
The fact that he didn't ask any question to sae-byeok bothers me lol
I just wanted to look at ji hoo
I really really Love them Until... Right Now 💝💖❤💗💓💕💘💝
as a consumer of korean entertainment over the past decade, it's so crazy to see korean artists, movies and dramas breaking into mainstream american culture these past few years
Koreans and Japanese people are soo humblee.😍😍
Where’s my man Ali?
Wi ha-joon is the FINEST Korean boy I have ever seen😩
Just here to see Ho-yeon
Ahh the squid game is amazing
It’s a great show
Baby squad
4:52 Jimmy Fallon's patented fake laughter
Man I wish north and south korea where together they could really make some business off acting
is there an interviews with the actor who plays Ali? Im really interested how he got such a amazing role being non-korean!
💜
They seem very polite and discret. But Jimmy seemed to be on drugs with all these exaggerated reactions. Way too much, dude. O seriado é ótimo (e olhe que eu não tenho paciência pra nenhum. Mas esse é massa demais!).
Where’s Ali??
It's a great aaa series
<3
I love wihajoon
Damn the word "Biggest television movie on Netflix" hits hard
"When did u realize the show became so big?"  "Right now." That was amazing梁梁
How come Ali and the old man are never on these interviews? Edit: jimmy is such a fake ass. His laughs are so fake as fuck! Fucking suck up. That’s why I can’t stand him
squid game..awesome 😍😍😍 series2 wating 👍👍👍👍
As usual I can't tell if Jimmy's drunk or not..
https://youtube.com/shorts/yMeqMiyFKyA?feature=share
Dang there famous
Jimmy's fake laugh is so unbearable none of the guests even laughed with him at 4:52 😐
Koreans are so polite and thoughtful in their interviews. Jimmy Fallon though didn’t do a great job really probing them with questions; one actor didn’t even say anything! This could have been so much better…
Lol，After Watching this show.  Does anyone say that the squid game on Netflix is not real?  There is no doubt that their acting skills are outstanding and true.
This is cool but where the fuck is Il-Nam???
Main reason I haven't watched this sh*tt and I never will is because everybody is talking about it. Usually over hyped sh*tt is trash, like the walking dead, got etc.
4:50 Jimmy and his fake laugh again
*love them*
African movies can now join the chat 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
F t
4:50 the fakest laugh ever lol

Jimmy Fallon is not funny, I don't know anyone that actually watches this shit interview style
That damn doll is the stuff of nightmares, and you know someone is going to dress like her for Halloween and just freak people out.
overrated show, nothing original about it
Park hae soo is so adorable oh my goddddd😭😭💗💗
Jung Ho-yeon is so beautiful I just want to keep looking at her
They’re all so great looking damn
POPULAR OPINION: SQUID GAME IS NOT OVERHYPED, IT'S INDEED SUPERB.
Who else is only here to only see hoyeon jung
Jimmy’s vocabulary is just oh I love it, I’m so happy, This is so great.
Squid Game Rules!!!👍👍👍👍👍
Jimmy Fallon is cringe worthy with his interviews! 😣
I thought this was BTS
The detective or the policeman role is so useless :) why he is with them .. I guess for saving his iPhone charge for 2 weeks 🤣
why they never have ali in interviews!
can Jimmy stop with the fake laugh already omggggg

Where’s the old man!?!?
The show was a 8.5 out of 10 for me, really good but some poor acting at the end with the VIPs and so so ending made me not love it as much as others
Jimmy Fallon honestly seems like he's not into this inside, he looks tremendously forced during some moments
Jimmy is so insincere and American,
Idk how Jimmy has such a big talk show and yet he still isn't that great at hosting. It get awkward sometimes
Now I remember why I don’t watch these shows. Jimmy Fallon is such a weird, awkward fucking interviewer.
I fancy the cop so bad
south korean productions/ entertaiment taking over america and the whole world...we luv to see it 😍
I hope Netflix get W: two worlds. I think it’s the best Korean drama ever.
Do you think i have potential to be an artist?
Jesus Christ the most loving king to all of mankind came down from His heavenly glory became flesh and died and was resurrected from the dead by God to save us from the wages of our sin,so that for whosoever should believe in Him,acknowledging with ur mouth Jesus is Lord,believing with ur ❤️ that He was raised from the dead and would call upon his name and turn of sins would be justified/saved and freed with assurance everlasting life in Jesus name!Time is short!God bless y’all !♥️
hoyeon jung is so fine
QTS💜
I mean, thank you for trying but can they please work on it a bit more. I say some people saying they should use English names so their names are not butchered, but you that´s not an excuse!! If you can say Jungle, you can say Jung-Jae... he kept saying Chung, I was cringing😅 ... BTW Who is Ha-Jin?
Teacher: how did your parents make up your name Squid?       Squid: uhm
WHERE’S ALI?!
she’s gorgeous..
What is Jimmy talking about when he says the main character is so likeable and we're all rooting for him in the beginning?? hahaha. Did he watch the show? The main character is lousy to his mom, a questionable father, and a degenerate gambler lol. That's not likeable but to each their own standards I guess hahah.
Squid game is no 1 trending show in Nepal 😍
The fact that Korean actors are on jimmy fallon speaking Korean talking about Korean textbooks and stuff to a western audience makes me so proud 🥲
Idk why but to me jimmy seemed odd lol idk he just seemed extra for no reason.
Jimmy trying to say Korean names, is hilarious.
You guys is so cute
And I'm probably the only person in the world whose hearing about squid game 🙄 i came after the viral candy and everyone talking about squid game 😅
Yeee
this interview got fd up by jimmy. Thanks jimmy
Jimmy Fallon is fighting for his life trying to pronounce their names 😂
To be honest Ali deserved more recognition than Joon-ho
I KNOW THAT GUY FROM A K DRAMA ABOUT BOOKS!!!!!
Jimmy thank u for having squid game in ur show  U r love by K-Pop and kdrama fans
So humble. So classy. Beautiful people and actors 💕
BABY SQUID IM GOING TO CRY
최고 👍
I love this!! pretty rare to see koreans on American shows!!
There's soooo going to be a season 2, right? I'm only on episode 4 so I don't know what happens towards the end but I'm thinking they will make another season.
Hmm.. Ali is definitely dead since he isn’t appearing on variety shows but sae - byeok is definitely alive! She escaped during coffin transportation and they also didn’t announce “player 067 eliminated”!
WELCOME BABY SQUID😅❤ HAE SOO IS SOOOOO CUTE, I LOVE HIM SINCE PRISON PLAYBOOK AND JAE JUN OMG I WANNA HIM 😭😍
BABY SQUID THATS THE CUTEST AWHHH
This entire exchange is just awkward man especially when Jimmy gives that Fakest laugh ever
Where is Ali
다른배우들도 다 멋지지만 개인적으로 이정재 진짜 존나 멋있다 이번에 오징어 게임을 통해서 헐리우드진출했으면 좋곘다.
HoYeon speaking english is one of the best thing ever

I love the shoes 🥰🥰
Jimmy looks nervous af
Hallyu (Korean wave) taking over the world from Kpop to Kdrama to Kbeauty.
totally butchered their names😭😂
these comments are so annoying. We get it, there are a lot of kdrama/kculture enthusiasts here but, y'all doing too much.  Squid Game is amazing but the genre it falls under is very popular, add netflix into it - the most popular streaming platform, there you have it.  Most people love this type of plot, it reminded me so much of Saw (esp the 1st one), 3% etc. Not taking anything away from the actors who were incredible but yeesh...
I wish Hoyeon gets to speak more, she's good in English. If only it was longer, but still everyone did great.
I just want ali on one of these shows with the cast
they’re so cute
Why is Ali never with the cast?
I love the way how jimmy has researched about each one of them and about the games
This Is Adorable 💕
Jung Hoyeon is my favorite I love her
squid game based on real games used by crazy rich elites...no lie
I thought the girl robot was based off the character from My neighbor tortoro. I was wayyyyyy off lol
Where’s Ali?! 😭
Finally kdramas are getting the recognition they deserve!!! I used to get made fun of for watching them.
So good to see the biggest stars of Korea now dominating on the global stage in film and music
Why didn't he ask her any questions? :/
Hae Soo congratulations on becoming a father 🥺💗
Ughhh, I love them.
I LOVE THEM
this interview is so weird and cringy. the laugh is forced. its the language barrier issue.
AHHH I’m really trying my best not to hate sung woo knowing it’s just a show but I can’t😭 his acting is the best
I’m so glad that the questions weren’t cheesy or disrespectful this was well done and i’m glad that the korean film industry is getting more attention, it is always so well written and produced, it deserves the attention it’s gotten and more.
Jimmy: "I'm not going to give away any spoilers." Also Jimmy: "Let me tell you about what happens during the red light, green light game." Me: "My dude, I don't think you understand what spoilers mean."    -_-
Lee jungjae is so handsome! Love his and his character so much
Aaaaa estoy soñando 🥺🤧😭❣
Aaaaa estoy soñando 🥺🤧😭❣
이정재 Jimmy  투 샷을 보다니     😍
No one talked about the last clip of how he saved him
I’m not sure but jimmy is acting awkward he have no idea what to say
0:09 the way he butchered their names, at least try
NEXT UP ➡️➡️ https://youtu.be/BWKcV5Jgm9k
baby squid!!!
한국식 방식으로 소개해주었네요. 감사합니다. Thank you for introducing actors in Korean way, last name then first name.
Jimmy fake laugh sent me .... goosebumps
Why wasn't the actor who played ali there?
Jimmy doesn’t understand the show at all. There is no real heroes or villains in the show. They are people placed in a position that tests humanity.
I loved the show hated the ending honestly. But overall it was fantastic! Can they just admit the show was just one giant Sony PlayStation ad! Lol jk
I'm very happy for korean film industry ❤️
Lee Jung Jae handsome look with the suit brings me back to his iconic role in 'New World' He was so.. handsome with suits in that movie. Still handsome now too😍😍😍😍
Jimmys Fake ass laugh goddamn
Ali is a main character
Jimmy laugh so fake he didn't find that funny lol
hey my gf is on Jimmy fallon…
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2DD6pfYhSo
These people are too damn talented and good looking. Bless them, they're awesome
I love everything about this
Baby squid🥺
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
am i the only one who feels this interview awkward? 💀 JJJGDSAJA😢
they deserve all this hype and recognition! <3
THE MOST IGNORANT COMMUNIST GARBAGE...FEEL BRAINWASHED BY THIS GARBAGE? DEATH TO LIBERAL COMMUNIST LAMES IN AMERICA.  YOUR WEAK SCUM
Jimmy's laugh makes me so uncomfortable like it's so scripted I can't
Honestly, this show is one of the greatest productions I’ve ever seen. I just finished it 30 minutes ago. Incredible, 10/10 recommended it to like 5 different group chats
So happy for Saebyeok, this was her acting debut or second acting appearance if I'm not mistaken, and it was already such a big success! I appreciate every actor who took part in this amazing show, glad to see them on a famous American western show as well...❤
hoyeon my beloved
Greetings from Denmark..... I think i speak for the entire planet right now, when I say WE WANT MORE TV SHOWS FROM KOREA!!!!!  Thanks for squid game :D
Was this whole Q&A prepared in advance?  How come the subtitles are shown in real time as they speak?  I'm very confused rn
Jimmys fake laugh makes me want to die
Hoyeonnnn😩
Park Hae Soo’s so adorable, I loved him in Game Caterers too 😂
Realmente los amo  Squid Game es la mejor serie
so glad kdramas are finally getting the recognition they deserve, people have been sleeping on them for way too long.
Some male actors got two questions but the female actor didn't even have a single question asked directly to her
that pretty girl speaks English?
I really love these four people omg plz bring s2 I love this show so muchhhh😥😥
4:52 Jimmy pushing out that laugh as hard at he could LMFAO. After watching that scene back though after knowing this it’s so obvious she was laughing 😭
1:58 *What did he say? I want to meet Jimmy's brother?*
"The cast of 'Squid Game' is PeRFeCt " I know no one's gonna fight me-
It wouldn’t be that bad if it was a small spoiler, but I feel like that was a *pretty big* spoiler 😂
Idk I’m just asking but out of all the guys, 2 of them seem gay…so I’m just asking cuz Ik some guys sit with legs crossed but I just need some clarification.   Are any of them gay?   I better not get hate for asking a question ong  LMAOO so y’all obviously didn’t read wtf I just said it’s a damn question. tf and if u don’t wanna answer then don’t. Get tf out my comments with that bs. I love all the cast members in this video I’m just a curious person. If y’all get mad because someone was asking a question, like a general question, I feel bad for the people who have to deal with u.🙄
*LOL, I wonder how hard did he have to practice to say all those names during the introduction.*
hi, Come watch the Mugunghwa game(Red Light, Green Light) played by the dog.^^
Ummmm that clip he showed is definitely a spolier... anyways I binged watched squid games in less than 24 hours. LOVED every second of it!!
Shout out to all my Asians who don't have fake European name.  Love from Africa.
Love  the squid game and the actors. I like Jimmy, but man - his  fake laugh is getting worse!
So glad the old man isn't there. I couldn't stand another minute of his constant stupid smile.
Jimmy should have asked the girl if she even lifts bro
he mispronounced like all of their names
ali deserved to be there 😭
RIP to all the other 500 cast members who weren't featured...
The best car information reference
Geez Jimmy is horrible at interviews now a days.
He asked all the guys questions specifically but not hoyeon 🤔
Okay but he didn’t even ask the girl anything
When you see them here you realise they were acting and yet it looks so real
They are attractive as hell.
Why I'm not on 😈😭😭😩
I love squid game.i watched it twice
Ho  Yeon  pronouncing ‘girl’ is my new favorite thing
Wow cast know to speak English finally 🤣🤣🤣
I know it’s just a tv show but after bingeing the show it’s just so nice to see that they’re all OKAY lol. Clearly I’m a little traumatized but the show was so well done and poignant.
The girl is just too cute 🥰
"I wanna meet Jimmy brother" aww 🤗
ហិយៀយៀ
That was the FAKEST 'live' interview ever....!! Come on  .. how can people not tell that it was pre-recorded.... they were never 'talking' to Jimmy...!!  fucking pull the curtains people....  A true feather on Fallon's cap eh guys...
If you thought this was good then watch: The man from nowhere, A Violent Prosecutor, A Hard Day, New World,Nameless Gangster, No Tears for the Dead, The Divine Move, Hwayi A Monster Boy,A Dirty Carnival, Night in Paradise, Witch, and then to change it up: The way home :). This is just one genre too.
Where you get the doll !?
I don't think Jimmy has seen the show cz he said everyone was rooting for him at the start but actually he was a pretty terrible person and not charming at all 😂
(Says,"No spoilers." and plays a clip of the show anyways)
This is my first time hearing their real voices, I watched it in dub
자막없어도 계속 한국어가 들려서 대충 이해되는게 신기하다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Jimmy. You are great friend of Korean. ∆
Love Jimmy Fallon!! he is the best night time show host. -from south korea.
Where is Ali???????
Fantastic to see Korean Movies and Tv Shows starting to really become famous in the West. I've always found Korean acting to be some of the best in the world and the storylines for their shows are so original and interesting. Plus...Korean women are almost all stunning!
I absolutely love the woman, she's a beautiful awesome character and just in absolute awww ❤️
1:38 지금 right nowㅋㅋㅋㅋ
With the right people, right timing and right place it will produced such phenomenal result! Its like the whole world is talking about squid game! Im impressed
The actors are so amazing.... I guess I will start watching k dramas... Coz these actors are seriously good at their work❤❤❤❤❤
The principalities and powers of earth are in bitter revolt against the God of heaven. They are filled with hatred against all who serve Him, and soon, very soon, is to be fought the last great battle against good and evil. The earth is to be the battlefield—the scene of the final contest and the final victory. Here, where for so long Satan has led men against God, rebellion is to be forever suppressed.  Christ came to this earth in human form that He might stand as the Captain of our salvation, so that we should not be overcome by Satan’s power. And when the enemy has seemed to be gaining a signal victory over righteousness, God has been working in mercy and power to counteract his designs. Determined to efface the image of God in man, Satan works with an intensity of effort to hide God from view. Not openly does he work, but secretly, mingling the human and the divine, the spurious and the genuine, so seeking to bring confusion and distress. But in proportionate power divine mercy is revealed to counteract this wicked working and bring to light the enemy’s hidden purposes. ~Ellen G White  ~Letter 153 1901 par.12 Seek and ye shall find 🕯
I think every single person of the series should be here🙂 because everyone played a vital and brilliant role. And the biggest disappointment is Ali wasn't here🙂
The best casting ever. Squid Game is legendary.
jimmy fallon is so unbelievably annoying
I heard the hype about Squid Game and didn't feel an urge to really watch but once I found watched the trailer and learned it was a korean show!! Oh you best believe I started watching the show within an hour because Korean shows, dramas, movies, etc. are next level.
oh my gosh her shoes
HO YEON is soo confident in her English and we lovee it!❤❤🔥
I’m here for Park Hae Soo ❤️❤️
they’re so wholesome and not full of it like a lot of american actors
It's so funny when Koreans mistranslate "brother," and Americans misunderstand the intention behind it
In india we call red light green light  game name is London London statue 🤣
the acting was impeccable in the series, very convincing performances all around
Just love the film so much!!
Jimmy is getting more and more annoying
멋지다 ㅎㅎㅎ Thanks for having them!! So fun!!
I'm glad there were no questions like, "which one of our Hollywood actors have you always looked up to?"   But I'm out of the loop, the audience sound is piped in right?
First Parasite and now Squid game! Korea really takes over with their amazing dramas and movies!
am i the only one who feels "the squid game" is overrated?
🟧🟧🤯🤯🤯🟧🟧
Jimmy didn’t even ask Jung hoyeon a single question and when she said something he barely reacted to that. Not cool Jimmy
Yooooo. SQUID GAME! Such an exciting show! I hope they make a Season 2! 🦑🎯
They did a really good job at making me hate some characters
Damn #3 trending
This man is like wine. I'll be crushing on him till he's like 70 :)
I have to pay more attention to Korean cinema , Squid Game is  so amazing in matters of plot and omg the acting so amazing,  the whole show was so original , i hope they will do a second season.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
https://youtube.com/shorts/2QWw3saVW8c?feature=share
Baby squid congrats 🤍🤍
it would be great if korean artist learn english, specially at this point when the korean instrustry is around the world it would be so much easier for them give international interviews.
한국어 자막 넣어줘잉… ㅠㅠ
Ok pero sus sonrrisitas
Amazing. Hope folks will finally discover how rich Korea is with entertainment...
Wow, I'm impressed with Jimmy's pronunciation of their names!
por fin le dan crédito a la producción coreana 😌🥰🥳 living for thissss!!!
😍😍😍😍
👍
1.5 million views in 14 hours!!!!!! Wow
President Trump is Live on Sean Hannity Tonight on Fox News 9 pm eastern standard time.
THEY ALL LOOK SO GOOD
FLY ME TO THE MOON SKSKS
I wish he talked more about jung ho yeon and her shift from modeling to acting
They're nice. 😹🖤
Finally 😍
My biggest flex is watching squid game not bcoz of the hype but the Storyline 😎🙌
My name is Zarina! Am from Kazakhstan! I love you 💕 ❤️
there is however always a unbeliveable kinda made up hype about korean things... its not as good as it seems. Kpop and many more.
LMFAO they are trying to sell parasite ? thats a bit sus 😂
anyone else notice how Jimmy not once addressed a question to the only female  and also, i may add, the only one who spoke good enough english to carry an interview in the language (when she spoke about psycho doll, Jimmy left the floor open to anyone, he didn't address her by name and ask HER the question like he did w the rest of the cast). seems a bit sexist, but idk Korean cultural norms so maybe it has something to do with that but umm yeah not a good look
How we gonna watch season 2 without these actors 😥
Man why is Ali not in every interview when the cast of Squid Games tryna promote with all the other actors
○△□
○△□
○△□
I hate it how they only invite people when they suddenly blow up or go “viral”. Like where were u jimmy when all these other kdramas dropped. 🙄
Baby squid aweee🥺🥺🥺🥺
6:33 Back in 5 seconds
Such a good show and great acting. I love South Korean media. I wish the actor who played Ali was also invited!
🙈
🔥
I can't with Jimmy and the fake laughing pls stop it's so obvious
If they're such a big deal, them why'd you make them your SECOND Guest, huh Jimmy???
Ho-Yeon is the only one who speaks english
Shut un stupid sir
Man, as an avid watcher of Korean dramas and Korean movies for years, seeing all Korean content get more and more fans lately and seeing increasingly more Korean shows being talked about and available on huge streaming platforms like Netflix just makes me so so happy. Before I couldn't talk to anyone about my kdramas, it was just my own little world but now I have whole conversations with friends about some of them and it honestly just blows my mind. I hope people start appreciating kdramas more and more because it's honestly so worth it, trust me...! This cast did a great job, I absolutely loved Squid Game, and seeing my beloved actors on American TV Shows makes me really proud <3
Where is Ali?
Here in Brazil, this creepy doll says something else haha. She says "French fries 1, 2, 3. Batatinha frita 1, 2, 3. The subtitles changes a lot of things, wow
loath Fallon. good casting
OMG Jimmy's fake laugh so obvious
I hope that, after squid game, people will watch more korean series/movies because there are so many great kdramas.
Jimmy’s fake laugh is the worst
Yes, I saw it and it is an amazing movie! 👍👏
4:52 that was the fakest laugh ever
Where is ali and the old man?🤨🤨
haesoo talking about his son is so ADORABLE AAAH he's so cute
Korea is really taking over! Their music and dramas are being recognized by US general public not just the few kfans anymore. I’m sure Koreans are proud their culture is being recognized so much abroad.
Haesoo is a funny guy.
HELPPP THE FAKE LAUGH WHEN GI HUN'S ACTOR WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPROV SCENE???!
THANK YOU FOR BEING SO RESPECTFUL JIMMY
Why ali is not there?
Why didn’t he ask the queen any questions. What is this shit
Saebyeok
Buy SHIBA INU GODDAMNIT.
Jimmy you changed the display picture🤗
Where is Ali they should of invited him.
WHY DIDNT JIMMY ASK ANYTHING TO HO YEON🙄 IM HERE FOR HER
How come they cut that very scene of Ali helping out Gi-hun?! That's blasphemy.
https://youtu.be/uUHZJ2lBqNY
Can we just appreciate the fact ppl are appreciating k drama and the whole world bcs if this is good then the rest of it is lit
It's funny👏👏👏👏WOW~~~
why did Jimmy seems so nervous
whyd he ask hoyeon nothing
My favourite cast <3
The way you didn’t talk to hoyeon at all
Korean celebrities are great but a lot of their people in general are either rude or stuck up. Been to there country and seen it. Even in America, they're stuck up.
Jung Ho-yeon honestly might be the most beautiful person on this planet. Omg. How can a human being look like that. I mean, she is stunning.
Best show ever
SO CUTE SO CUTE
Não tem legenda em português :// tem algum canal com essa entrevista legendado ??
I am not really interested in Kpop, but this series cast are amazing and i really love that woman , her energy is just so amazing
If I was asked to tell what are 2 main things that make Squid Game so great, the answer: *_ART_* & *_ACTING_* The cinematography, DOP, consistent pastel color, and setting atmosphere are so d a mn good! Kudos to the art director, Chae Kyung-sun!!
"Baby squid" you are charm one of your dad.. how cute😘
Look I love them all but no offense I wanted to see Ali and oh ill nam T_T LIKE PLEASE ALSO THE CRAZY GIRL LMFAOO
It's sooo goood to see now everyone understanding little by little my obsession with k-dramas for over 12 years, everything about it is insane and upgraded! From the production to the acting, Squid Game is a masterpiece!
Jimmy is trained to interview Korean celebrities cuz of BTS
They deserve the attention so much ! Happy for them !
Not the biggest tv-series of all time in the world.Could likely be ONE OF the best to date in the world AND the best horror-related tv-series,perhaps exceeding Stranger things or American horror story,or just being shy of them...But, it's most certainly the biggest NETFLIX-tv-series OR at least it's becoming so,now when it's by GUARANTEED the most viewd ,biggest and best non-English speaking (also) NETFLIX-tv-series...perhaps of all time,no matter streaming platform or tv-series of the non-English-speaking ones..   Just trying to be non-exaggeratedly realistic and reliable here,though....lol..  And,I didn't get you there,could likley that you said "the  biggest tv-series.... streaming in Netflix"..Hmm?Didn't heard that right...But,otherwise get your facts right, more concrete and clearly next time lovely Jimmy Fallon...lol...🤷‍♂🙃😌😅👌✌👍💎🌈
I love how Koreans stand firm with using their own language! That is very commendable!
How did the host understand them? Was there instant translation?
WAIT HE PLAYS VILLAIN ROLES?!?!
park haesoo is so cute
I wish they’d brought the actor for Ali too 😭😭😭
The only reason I started watching it was because of Jung ho yeon because i was gay for her but as I continue to watch it everyone else is growing on me
Omggg I love them!!
Im proud of ya'll!!!  send my love!
Korea is producing very talented artists and musicians. They deserve much more recognition. These artists are taking over the world right now. We're happy that you've invited them on your show.
baby squid awww
Omg
I didnt know she speak in english 😍
An article I read said that  Sae-byeok was the most tragic & beloved character because of her backstory but I felt it was Ali .  I still want to bawl when I think of how he was betrayed and his family waiting ,for him to return to them. Even with a lot of bad English translation I enjoyed this show even more than "Game of Thrones". The entire cast knocked it out of the park!
This is so awkward I hate it
the interview is weird as the show is!
Wheres Ali man? we need Ali
After Jimmy mentioned this show and all the hype it causes,I wanted to see if I like it.I just finished the first episode.And I love it😂At first it was funny and then it quickly turned into a bloody murder game😂👍
For more none death red light green light many videos can be found on yt
jimmy: no spoilers also jimmy: shows a important scene of ali saving gi-hun
Y'all should buy SHIBA INU.
I feel like Jimmy only watched segments of the first episode.
Squid Game is the reason I'm here. LOVED IT!
It’s so cool hearing their actual voices.
You know what I would like to see in season2?  What the main characters would do with the money like a view in their life if they won before they died
Lee Jung Jae is a legend. He's not a character actor nor is he a newbie. He's like the Denzel of Korea. Put some respect on that name!!
I've seen Kpop groups referring to their fans as Younghee and I'm always confused, who the hell is she?? Only to find out that she's a Korean textbook character. 🎉 MY GOODNESS!
hajoon is so handsome i couldn't take my eyes off him
lee jung jae is so handsome omg i can't
Where's ALI????
I wanna know about the brown guy, and his experience in the squid game
Lol I love this
I can for the Squid Game cast and damn I remember why I stopped watching Jimmy Fallon. He’s kinda a terrible interviewer
-И русские такие здесь :хай бич или приветик. АХАХАХАХАХХААХАХАХАХХАХААХА.
Where is Ali?
Jung Ho-yeon is insanely pretty.
4:53 must be the most awkward Jimmy Fallon laugh ever
Baby squid 🦑❤️
Baby 🦑
SO cool you interviewed them and let them know how big they are in the U.S
The lady English is really good. They shld ask her more questions tho. And Wi Ha Joon is super goodlooking 🥰
I’m so happy they speak their own language here.
Korea is filled with so many talented people and I'm glad the world is starting to realize that.
I had to look twice when I saw the channel name
90 countries?? Wow! Good job guys! It's epic!
Why is Ali never included ?
I used to like and watch Jimmy. Was he always this over-the-top?? He comes off as disingenuous.
"I feel it in my bones", if that doesn't convince you to follow your dreams, idk what will. Squidgames came out of left field and deserves all the attention its getting
I am so happy for the cast but lol it's so funny to see so many locals and ppl all around the world who talked shit abt kdramas and korean culture without knowing anything abt it now be obsessed or understand why it is so popular. Don't judge something you know nothing about.
So proud!!!!! of everyone behind Squid Game and of course especially to the amazing cast of Squid Game! I love the story! and the drama! so much and I love them so much! I can't freaking wait for season 2! SQUID GAME FOREVER A LEGENDARY! ICONIC! DRAMA! EVER THAT WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN.
Why so awkward Jimmy
오징어게임  frightening, shocking, beautiful exactly ^^
We have characters like those two characters from children's books in my country too ....so many people all over the country know them as simbi and okafor . If you are from my country and you know this comment the country's name
kdrama is known for quality and people go watch Korean drama you will not regret it
Bts sucks these are the real korean talent ❤❤
I'm so glad for Korea. Either music, film/show, they are always incredible 😊
squid game is really really something!
Kamsamneeda!!!
Squid Game is tearing our country apart !
Tbat laugh by Jimmy was cringe, it looked fake
https://youtube.com/channel/UC_UXT2Id2o0v-LaUTQSraVw
Jimmy did an incredible job with this interview.
Ho-yeon's role is North Korean refugee who has a big trouble in China. In other words, because China does not recognize them as refugees,  it arrests them and sends them back to North Korea, where they suffer a lot. North Korean refugee needs your attention a lot..
Jimmy didnt get the licking improv answer hahha
Jimmy always bring the Best! I love squid game 💘 a lot!!!!!
South Korea taking over the US with awesome movies, series and music!
Please tell me it surpassed GoT. They ruined the last season so bad it made all seasons before it obsolete.
Ali should be here too.....  This is unfair 😢
I never thought I would ever see american talk show hosts or just americans in general actually learn to pronounce and say korean names like this.  As someone who grew up with teachers being all " This is too hard so i wont even try it" when it came to foreign names, Im feeling proud af.
the squid game cast deserve the world. also congratulations to haesoo and his wife on their little baby squid!!
in South Korea, Lee Jungjae is already a top A list actor but now seeing how other actors and actress in squid game also get a lot of attention around the world is so fascinating
lol jimmy hahahhahah   happy squid game gang is here haha
Great show.  Highly recommended squid game
Such class and respect wish we were all like this
More international presence 😄 this is amazing, so beautiful and educational. Hopefully we can all start diving into new cultures and learning languages outside of English. Plus they are all fit
Did he say jimmy father???
Lost souls in Seoul.
Ali is the best
I was smiling during the video nonstop jajajaajja so happy for them
When Squid Game first came out, i just dive into the story without knowing who the casts and i was surprised to see Lee Jung Jae played such a loser character 😂 i see a new side of him..such a brilliant actor.
HAE SOO IS SO CUTE
is it j me or does it feel like the actor who played sang woo is like a mirror of Kim taehyung's personality?
THIS IS A WIN! Not just for South Korea but Asians in general. Asians are becoming more known on the screens and it’s been a long time coming.
It's so amazing that korean entertainment industry on fire..they are braking all the boundaries...i am so lucky that i am a big fan of kdrama and kmovie
wow, they are all cool actors and actress!! we love them!
neeeeed bae suzy on here next 😄
Jung hoyeon 😍
God I love Korean drama but squid game just hit me different 😉👌
Yeah I just watched the freaking movie because of the song "money" By Lisa and it was great👍
The main character his given personality in the show i hate the most he is my least favorite charter from the 200 lol
Squid game ❤
This show is fuckin boring as shit. I hate this guy's gross face.
I wanted to see the pretty one that slaps them 😭😭😭 also she SPEAKS English 😍
I watch squid game for the plot… the plot: them
❤️❤️
Wi ha Jun is everything ,,, I have found new love 😍😍😍
hate fallon's laugh
They are so cute...
I luv their personality on and off camera!
Americans being amazed by Lee Jungjae's clean look makes it to korean articles and most of the korean responses are about how Jungjae is known as the handsome actor in Korea but people around the world just know about it after the series ends lol
Why Jimmy is stuttering????lol
The fact Saebyeok can speak perfect English just makes me wanna talk to her so bad 😭
North americans usually don't consume cinema or music from other countries untill they make it big inside the USA industry or get known on a global level because they think their stuff is better lol. They need to stop sleeping on foreigner and korean productions.Things have been centralized around the USA for the last decades now but this is changing and we are seeing the industry getting more diverse, we saw the kpop rise, the Latino music rise, the korean movie industry is getting there and I hope other cultures find the same opportunity cause I love seeing new things.
🇰🇷
I’m so happy rn, I’m so proud of them, since I’ve loved them for their previous dramas and hoyeon from her modelling too :,)
They look like family but no mother Lee jong jae as Father Park hae soo as first son Wi ha joon as second son Jung ho yeon as youngest son
ay los amooooo
Ahhh so glad and pretty astonished to see them on American show but this should not feel like a surprise since Squid game is a global hit after all. Jimmy is fast we love to see it. Wow. Great time.
Nice to see them alive
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Man im pissed I already finished the show. I can't imagine what they're going to do with season 2 though
I was waiting for this lol
Is it bigger than????
How can he read there names?
It’s nice to see more foreign celebrities on American talk shows. Fallon does a great job of interviewing non-English speakers.
Jimmy is definitely the worst interviewer on tv.
i love them🥺❤️
Jimmy fallon has to be the cringiest show host ever.
The actor who played Ali deserves more recognition! Imagine coming to Korea to study, and then get cast in Netflix top tv show
Eles são tão fofos aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Jimmy Fallon is fangirling for them 😅😅
Where is Ali ?? :(
Ok but seeing there faces is just like.....they got my mood up. 067,29,456 and 218 they...........kill me in the vid
Ali should have been there
I love the fact that Jimmy doesn't go with the typical question of "who's your favorite actor/actress? What's your favorite english word?" he's really interested in the show and that shows his professionalism
I like the funny mask man hahaha
I expect nothing less from you Jimmy! Great interview, great host!
Why didnt u call them in real lifex
what about ali :(
I m literally waiting for ali...here....but its sad...he is not here
YouTube is Highkey racist how they puting parasite as the movie to watch
She mentioned NIKI at 3:50 hahahaa
How is this guy still on TV his reactions are always so exaggerated and fake
What do you mean you´re not giving any spoilers xD You did it multiple times!
Everyone in Brazil is watching and making memes  🇧🇷 ❤ this show is so good , we need season two.
Could they have given this interview to a different late night host? 😒
If people like other cultures then I recommend the middle eastern culture their beats and some of their movies especially Turkish are amazing same with their dramas while middle eastern music is the best.

Dear Jimmy and Staff:  Thank you for always having such entertaining, yet thoughtful interviews, especially with foreign guests.  I sincerely appreciate it.  Keep up the good work!
How does the north Korean spy speak English? That's very suspicious
Oh man, no hate here really, but there's always something that doesn't quite fit at the end in these international interviews. I think the United States are so used to be always in the spotlight, that they can't handle when a foreigner act breaks onto the scene. Like i get it, we're still healing from the COVID situation, they're far apart, and we all have different cultures.. But there's always something missing from me, i have this vibe of Jimmy Fallon pulling the car on his own because the guests clearly don't get his overreactions and jokes. I love this show, but i really think America must know their era of entertainment leadership monopoly has ended.
All the male actors are great🌸
Got surprised when the girl spoke so well in english...never saw that cng
Get that grandpa he the real mvp
why the caption are so big?
Fake laugh . jimmy.
Korea proving once again that they're not only good at Cosmetic industry but also music and movies! Legendary
jimmy fake laughing is 2/10, try harder
이정재 진심 멋지다. ❤
Lovely cast! I’m so happy Squid Game is getting lots of attention - hopefully it’ll lead to lots of other incredible dramas being discovered as well
46 billion won is about equivalent to 38 million usd
OMGGG ❤️
정호연 너무 lovely.
Oh come on he didn't even properly talked to Jung Hoyeon
"When did u realize the show became so big?"  "Right now." That was amazing😂😂🥺🥺  Edit: WOAHH, I woke up and all of a sudden have over 5k likes, tff! Thank u everyonee
Can we appreciate Jung Ho-Yeon's (player 067) English.... 😁 😍
The story is so interesting when i started to watch ep 1 and i then cant stop myself from watching The old man is a real deal omg I dont have a idea about him
Koreans have an impeccable sense of dressing
These cast are awesome! success across the planet.. ✌🏻👏🏻👏🏻🇧🇷
헉!...대박
I just wish there was korean music over the general american music they were putting throughout the series, and the american VIP's, there was no need for that could've been all korean cast.. The show is great and the korean actors did such a great job but man the american actors were so bad, hopefully it'll get better in season 2
Jimmy's Korean naming sound is getting better and better.
I want Wi Hajoon’s sweater.
OMG
I haven't seen the show yet. I usually watch anything and everything Korean. I'm really into it. I'm in the middle of watching three Kdrama's right now. Lol
The fourth episode called "Stick to the team" where everyone just kills eachother in flashing lights was the most disturbing shit I have seen.
Dimana ada lee jung jae disitu ada saya  #LeeJungjaeAkupadamu😘😘😘😘
What happened to their English??? With their experience, I'm sure they'd have at least the basics🤦
4:52 Jimmy's fake laugh
Let's wear black and not tell hajoon
My question is Why doesn't ali get invited to the interviews??
hae soo is so so opposite from his character he’s sweet and funny but then sangwoo just sucks
Umm where is my boy Ali?
Squid Game has been the no.1 netflix show in Malaysia since its debut in late Sept 2021...
Man, no puedo con la belleza de Wi y Hoyeon, jo💀
Can we appreciate how Wi Ha Joon looks so fuckin handsome 😍😍😍😍
Squid games like parasite will open so many doors for people to discover the world of kdramas so many of the shows are filmed like top quality movies in America kdramas r superior
i cant understand english im german lmaoo
Not they talked about that straw scene and the fact that ho yeon was literally laughed hard at it during the shoot lmaoo i can't believe they talked about it here😭😭😂ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I'm really happy that more people are now getting aware what a kdrama is! Koreans' emotion, story and cinematography are just something that no one should be sleeping on! I hope people check out more dramas :)
Hoyeon english accent ♥️😩
Love Story ... 🌝🌹 https://youtu.be/vZ-Dg0_oVR0 💕😗
Jungjae, he is SO SO HANDSOME, 😭
throwing some hands bc i still haven’t seen ali alive in any interviews
why there is no Ali??💔
I’m so proud of them!
Ohhh damn this korean show did so much success they’re on a late night show now wowwww
I love it
Ho-yeon!!! You are so lovely <3
I feel left out because if have no money to buy Netflix.
Lee JungJae was the cutest character on the show for me. His smile and his positivity, omg. I'd die for him.
I would have really loved to see Anupam Tripathi ( Ali ) here as well as I do consider him to be amongst main cast
Biggest television show in the world 👏👏
it’s crazy seeing my man wihajun blowing up, i’ve seen many of his characters and he’s such an amazing actor, i wanna see him with more psychopath roles because he makes me despise his character, showing he’s clearly a very good actor, i’ve been taking screenshots of his success and can i just say, he went from 300k to 5 million followers in a week, i’m so proud of him and i can’t wait to see him in more dramas
https://youtu.be/bA2LwEfLJEw
오징어게임=한국   , No china
I miss Ali
After being so amazed by Squid Game, I'm now ready to start Kingdom. :D
Not Jimmy fake laughing as per usual
I’m literally so obsessed with this show rn 😭💙
It is weird to see Hae-soo being funny and nice irl😂😂
why didnt he let hoyeon talk more smh
Overrated show watch Alice in borderland it's far better
MY LOVES, MY HOUSE, I LOVE CAST<33
HOYEON 😢😢
Hoyeon voice 😎
Why did he ignore the guy in the red sweater the entire time lol
Ayoooo heyeon english accent is cool😏😍💅
شفتها اول ما نزلت الحين له ١١ ساعة 😆💓💖💓💘✨🌈💖🎀🌸💕
legends legends legends!!!
Why no ALI 😭😭😭
Koreans have some serious talent in depicting social inequality, they make it raw and realistic, yet so creative!
Hello everyone I'm from Cambodia 🇰🇭❤️
"baby squid" so cute !! so Park HaeSoo is now *"papa squid"*
Haesoo, ahjussi I LOVE YOUUU
I’m not someone who enjoys T-series. But Squid game really got me hooked. The actors are really good, the music fits perfectly the scenes and there’s an implicit criticism of the system. It’s deeper than what many people think
As someone who has watched Korean shows for over a decade I’ve been so mindblown by how this one got so huge! But I can definitely understand why it is very different from many others I have watched. I always get suggested kdramas on Netflix so I was like ok this looks good but then I noticed the sign that said #1 in the US and I’m like whatttt!! Amazing! If ppl like the action and blood and survival then you would probably like sweet home!
HO YEON IS LITERALLY PERFECT! She's gorgeous, talented and she speaks very well English 😳💕
oh god i’m simping hard for hoyeon’s english 우리 둘이 여자지만👀ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋ아니ㅜㅜ걍 너무 멋있잖아요오오오오
Korean wave really do be going crazy
Chigum ..right now🤣😂🤣
Squid game is unlike anything I've ever seen. The actors are able to capture true terror, disgust, anger, sadness, and that raw greed for even a glimpse of money. The acting is so amazing
Jimmy Fallon,  thank you so much.  이정재 너무너무 멋지고 잘생김. 웃는 모습 섹시하고 매력적인 상남자 이정재. So Sweet. 👍👍👍👍🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️🤩
Jimmy Fallen!!! His name is Ha-Joon! Not Han-Joon!
4:51 wtf was that jimmy? You could’ve tried harder
I loved the Interview but where is my boy Ali. He was my favorite in the tv show.
I wish we got to hear more from Ho Yeon! She was absolutely amazing!!! The biggest crime of this show was only showing Gong Yoo’s face for like 5 minutes total 🤣
중국과 일본이 이 영상을 싫어합니다... ㅜ
Squid game is a good source to train listening of Korean conversation!
They are so cute, I love them!
taRumlüg  Programmierer der Master  K. I.      .        .        .
Tremendos actores y terribles bombones <3
is anyone notice jimmy didn't ask Jung hoyeon anything?
Hello
Ahhhh I wanted to hear Jung Ho-yeon talk a little more. Her character has so many layers!!
I can’t watch Jimmy anymore. His laughs are so forced
These kinds of american talk shows suck so bad man
Alexa play money by Lisa
2:16 just say your name boy, don't be afraid of spilling the true ☠
Why is Anupam (ali) being ignored?
Where ALI?
Wouuu corea si que se está globalizando que bien yaere Ian reconocimiento desde hace mucho tiempo, felicidades son un éxito
Lol Jimmy didn't ask Jung a single question despite her being the most popular and being the only one fluent enough to answer fully in English, she only got asked a question phrased for all of them
Hoyeon English wah i love it, and all of them look gorgeous!😭
Why he didn’t ask her anything ? ?
와 ㄹㅇ 뿌듯하다,, 진짜 너무 자랑스러워요 배우님들👍👍 이정재 오늘도 잘생김
I remember seeing tik toks of people sending picks of rocks to sang woo's actor
I love one of the actors who face reavel as a pink guard
This show is so good! They deserve all the successe
daddy sangwoo
papi sangwoo
Where ali
Squid game made soooo noise!! It's the first ever drama that I have seen so patiently from the first to last  and that too in less than 24 hours. I love it how people around the world are loving this drama so much! It's an amazing drama!! Shows stages of poor life and how money can change the life! I loved it a lot!!!!<3
I wanted a better question for jung ho yeon! especially cuz squid games was her acting debut and she is now the most followed korean actress on instagram in the world 😢
Show is so fire
Jung Hoyeon her English accent ❤❤
No spoilers!  I mean except for the whole first hour long episode...   Just watch this clip then start with part 2.
Where's the Pakistanian dude, the one who got the hardest blow!
Not Jimmy butchering some of their names
Okay, but he didn’t ask her a single question………
067 you have my heart i love you omg 🤣
BEST ASIAN SERIES SO FAR.
Jung Ho-Yeon looks like an 80's or 90's Hongkonger singer in the thumbnail.
Is there any thing different in jemmy's laugh or am I imagining that 🙂💔
Jimmy Fallon is literally the best interviewer for Koreans so far and I seriously hope he remains so. He doesn't ask dumb questions like who's your favourite American actor and seriously is just fun to watch, THANK YOU JIMMY!
South Korea have been making some really good shows on Netflix, like Kingdoms and Alice in Borderland.
신세계 영화보면 난리나겠네 ㅋㅋ
baby squid 😭♥️
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd0o-wXKRjw You should see Lee jung jae in this movie. How charismatic!
Them ❤️
와
so basically running man where members are held at gunpoint....😂
its so awkward cant lie
Very cool
Well in 2016 and 2019 people liked it. But nowadays in 2021 even Billboard itself thinks the Korean stuff is cheating the charts somehow.
Korea is full of talented people!
I live in a rock, what's movie about?
Squid Game is Parasite for stupid people.
yknow he's going to k-word you right Jimmy?
I miss Ali
love them
Jimmy: I'm not giving any spoilers. Also Jimmy: if the doll turns around you get shot.  THATS LIKE THE BIGGEST SHOCK FACTOR OF THE SHOW MAN
Why wasn’t my girl 67 given any questions with substance 😭 jimmy did her so dirty I’m so mad
park haesoo calling his son a "bundle of blessing" is soooo cute
I love that Jimmy is so nice to try his best to pronounce their name
Cool
this is so awkward but amazing at the same time
worst question tell me about squid game lmao
There’s something about Koreans
🤧❤️
Wonderful show. Wouldn't it be funny if they did a parody called the Squidward Games where Spongebob and the gang had to do deadly games like this. Patrick: "Please let me go home!”  Squidward: "Wake Me Up When I Care."
I would just like to send a message to all the people who made fun of me for watching Korean dramas back in 2015 2014 2016 era. I just want to tell y’all to suck it!
damn they all look so fine
🔥🔥🔥so happy for them
Wihajoon so cute <3🦈💕
❤❤❤
It’s weird seeing Sae-byeok smile lol but dang she’s beautiful and I like her freckles too.
I think  hae soo said right now because they get to be in this show...like the same show that all those famous hollywood actors was  on this show too
Ya la vi "El juego del Calamar " muy buena serie soy Fan de la serie Koreanas saludos desde México.
Sri Lanka Loves SqUiD gAmE ;) Let's Go Babes ♡~
Why does Jimmy feel so fake. Lmao. Feels like that fake hunger games show. 🤣
LOVE IT❤️❤️😩😩😩😩
I’m excited for season 2
Itz so cool to see Korean actors on Jimmy Fallon's show.
<3
Love you guy's ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Park hae soo so very handsome my sugar daddy
I had to turn this off when he laughed over the straw joke 😑, could clearly tell he didn’t find it funny but over did it with the table hits .. is it just me or does he cringe a lot of people out 🤣, love squid game ! Cast are amazing & show was brilliant
Jimmy Fallon: I'm not giving spoilers  Jimmy Fallon literally a couple min earlier: yeah the doll says RED LIGHT and then they shoot you if you move   🤔
They are so awkward 😅
He said “지금 right now” and i died…😆😆 Love them so much lol
" For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life."

10 hours and get 1 million this is..
The most handsome actor in this series is that guy slapping people at the train station!
So proud of them!!! 💜💜💜
남배우 셋이 목소리가 좋네
Amazing cast! 🤗☺️😲💓
Japan be like "Dang koreans!"
지미펠런쇼에 오징어게임이 ㄷㄷ...
I hope the actor of Ali gets featured next time too!!! So nice to see Squid Game go global!
I just loveeeee squid game it is so good the best one on Netflix
South Korean actors being on an American talk show is incredible! This show is amazing.
Aaaaah Park haesoo. Loved him in Prison Playbook. If yall haven't seen it yet. Go watch!!! It's on Netflix and is amazing!!!
Great acting! Teach us about human natures…good or bad people at the end still do anything to survive!
Jimmy with the spoilers. Wow I feel bad for people watching this who haven’t seen it.
squid game the show gives a good representation a persons inner desires and one of its roots is money
This channel never had 1 mio views in 10 hrs;
오징어 게임 인기 실화냐 ㄷㄷ 미국에서도 인기 급상승 4위네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 한국인들 모여라~~
https://youtu.be/z9eGxiUSSzI     squide game sad edit
His laugh at 4:50 was so forced and awkward it physically hurt me  But I'm glad this show is getting a lot of love, I hopenthwy have a lot of opportunities in the US
It's a great show.Everything is just super!!!https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNs_N1694OSy5EssECAZeGA
Jimmy ignored the only woman there
My heart goes like; Jung Hoyeon 🤩😝🥰🥺☺😚
Why not Anupam Tripathi he deserves it 😩
한국이 문화강국이 되는 시점
Whats up with the PlayStation buttons?
Watched 4 episodes and I'm so so addicted to the series. The cast, the acting and the direction is just SPOT ON. What a loveable set of characters.
The psycho doll 😳
MAN no lee byung hun huh, that the only reason why i watch the series, but after i watch the series man i wanna see more of ali but sadly he's dead the char i mean.
jimmy fallon: it is bigger than- **realizes that it isn't bigger than any show on netflix because it just came out**
cute
Yeeees this show 🔥🔥🔥🔥
🐁
fun fact : lee jung jae's current gf was once married to the chairman of Samsung lee jae yong
Idk y but this felt so awkward
4:50 Jimmy fallons fake laughs are so cringe 😬
Behind the scenes  https://youtu.be/IXESa9isyX8
I love watching squid game movie it's kinda scared tho hehe
Thank god girls know English in Korea
WHERE IS ALI'S ACTOR
Its so weird to me they are so chill but jimmy screams
Ho-Yeon Is gorgeous! omg
finally...korean stars and dramas getting the hype they deserve. thanks to squid game for bringing the whole world's attention to them
이정재 슈트빨보소
Lee jung jae is the man. Love his movie Deliver us from hell he was a badass character there.
If #Marjorietaylorgreen joins squid game shell be disqualified as it's a game for humans not real squids.
So great to see them on show 👍 Haesoo voice is so good JungJae smile is so sweet ❤️
I mean the show is good, but it's not that good
THE WAY THEY’RE 🥰🌸🧚🏼😍🌹✨ IRL MY HEART
Do you know this? Actor Lee Jung-jae was a symbol of youth and an idol.
finally,,,
*Its official, South Korea is taking over the world. We had PSY, BTS, and Parasite, now it’s Squid Game’s turn to take the world by storm.*
These boys are all fiiiiine
Well-deserved recognition. Everything about the show was splendid. Wi Ha Joon looks very charming. ❤️❤️❤️
How many times do you think Jimmy practiced their names 👀👀 LOL
This nigga too quick
Dog
I used to think that people who dies in movies actually dies in real life.
Korean’s entertainment industry really rising like never before. They have the most streamed artists, 2019’s best picture film and now the most streamed show ever. I can’t express how well deserved this is
wait season 2’😕🥳
they all look so charming.. omg
I loved Squid Games. Congrats to the new baby!
데뷔때부터 한결같이 멋진 정재오빠❤️
Is there Thai? I'm Thai 😊Is there Thai? I'm Thai 😊
Sangwoo
wow
YAS YAS YAS
Wow the squid game in the real life https://youtu.be/vlgWnbU71es
Ellen could learn something about interviewing foreign celebrities from Jimmy. He clearly made him self well informed about them and had good questions prepared.
Wi Ha Joon and Hoyeon ♥♥♥
Jungjae is that popular? I'm truly shocked and glad
I love them 🤗
É possivel se apaixonar por um elenco inteiro?
Ho-Yeon is great actress... she's so adorable,humble,cute and talented
Jimmy Fallon is SPOILERSSSS
오징어게임 참여해ㅛ더니 456억 부럽지않은 인기를 얻었네
정호연 왜케 아틀란타 한인타운 코리아살롱에서 50불 50전 주고 머리한 것처럼 하고 나왔냐 메컵도 교포 같네
My kdrama stars are getting real big
ITS NUMBER 1 IN BRAZIL ... HUGHS
Since they are filming in Korea they look pretty good for it being very early in the morning, there is a 13 hours time difference between the US and Korea
They all did a great job acting even side characters  Edit: Except the Vip guys
Jimmy’s excitement reminds me of Caesar Flickerman from The Hunger Games 🤣
Why sae byeok is so gorgeous 😭😭why??
love this show.
Whom should I focus on 😩
No clownery by Jimmy. What a shock
How the host understand korean?
Watch more of Park Hae Soo in Prison Playbook. If he's a smart maniac here, he's a dum dum lovable big bear on his show. I'm gonna watch it again next time.
Squid game was a truly amazing show! I binge watched the whole thing! So glad it's getting the recognition it rightfully deserves
This is the most refreshing show we’ve gotten from Netflix in a while! Netflix be losing its touch
Wow congrats to Daddy Park Hae Soo, Wi Ha-Joon I love you❤️❤️ Thank you Jimmy
Squid game 2 commin* soon https://youtu.be/-FdCcjXO5yQ
love this T_T
한국 배우들은 매우 겸손합니다 그들이 자랑스럽습니다
My boy Anupam Tripathi missing here
Great series!!! 👍👍
♥️ 🦑
Remember the hype for birdbox, haven't seen hype at this level since then, and this is even more hyped
why they didn't put ali at there(
binge watched squid games and had a rough day at work the following morning but so worth it!
I just love how Jimmy's leading the interview with the actors & actress from south Korea, in such a kind and genuine manner. 지미펠론이 오겜배우들성의있게 인터뷰해주는 모습 너무 좋당... 한국 좋아?하는게? 느껴짐 ㅜㅠ
What a emotional rollercoaster.. Absolutely everything about the squid game
Would loved to have Anupam Tripathi also in this show
Jimmy is painfully awkward
How sexism still exist in hollywood... I'm so excited for Ho-yeon and she wasn't ask any serious questions and just answers on the side. I'm sad...
Why is the female actor almost ignored from Fallon😡
I am simping for our girl soooo bad 😩😩😩
"No spoliers" ... *spoils the first game*
OMG, THEY’RE SO ADORABLE!!! And when Park Hae Soo mentioned about his baby, that ppl called his baby “BABY SQUID” is rlly cute
ANG GANDA NI SAE BEYEOK
jimmy's fake laugh got me rolling 💀
WHY ISNT ALI THERE? LIKE HIS SEEMS LIKE 1 OF THE MAIN CHARATERS AND HIS 1 OF THE MOST FAMOUS BUT HE ISNT EVER IN THESE INTERVIEWS?
OMG! The doll being in textbooks.. In India we have boojho and paheli
They are so beautiful
I was hoping Jimmy asked Hoyeon more questions! She's such a bae and can speak English so well
Honestly kuddos to Jimmy Fallon for being respectful towards foreign guests. Other talk show hosts take notes
오징어 게임의 이정재를 처음 본 사람들은 그 얼굴로 어떻게 빌런을 하냐고 하지만 이정재를 쭉 봐온 나같은 사람은 그 얼굴로 루저를 기가 막히게 연기한 이정재에게 감탄한다.
(Spoilers ahead!) if u watch ep2 closely, every character's fate were hinted there..  - Deok-su jumped off the bridge in episode 2. He died by falling off the bridge.  - Ali stole money from his boss. He died because someone stole the marbles from him.  - Sae-byeok threatened someone with a knife on their throat. She died when someone stabbed her on her throat.  - Sang-woo tried to kill himself in episode 2. He died by killing himself.  -Gi-hun swore on his mother's life. His mother died in the end.
THANKS JIMIN! LIKE FOR ALWAYSSS
One of the best show
I can't handle his fake laughs... still can't dammit..
Where is #Ali????
omg! I'm so proud of I'm Korean :x
Jimy is trying so hard ,his reactions seems fake
진짜야? 와 😁 너무 반가운 우리 배우 얼굴들이네요
You can’t really say it’s spoilers when that’s the scene the marketing team is basing practically their entire advertising campaign around. It’s more like the hook to draw people in. He was clearly told to talk about that bit since both the props he was given and the clip they had were of that game.
HOYEON IS SO STUNNING HELPP
If you loved Squid Game, you should definitely try watching Kingdom on Netflix. Equally as good
PLAGIAT FVKK!!!!
I love this Squid game.
Jung hoyeon is so pretty 🥺💗
Why isn’t anupam tripathi doing press ! He was part of the main cast !
They're shining!!!
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABT HOW CUTE HOYEON IS 🥺
Hoyeon spoke English so well I’m surprised and she’s so sweet and fashionable
Now we know the dolls names it's yangi  *Idk the true spell but that's how we pronounce it*
Lee Jung Jae's girlfriend is ex-wife of the chairman of Samsung.
I came to know about this series becoz of jennie and I didn't regret watching it🥰
Park Hae Soo!!!
Where's my cutie ali? :(
HER ENGLISH IS SO GOOD
Omg Jimmy was giving all types of spoilers lol 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
Jimmy is so fake it's cringe. His laugh sounds so forced
I wished all squid game members were this show in person and they play game in person😭😭
The reason why Korean children shout "무궁화꽃이 피었습니다 " when they are playing is that the sentence is made in 10 syllables like we count ten (10). And Mugungwha flower is Korean national flower. The meaning is "Korean national flower is in full bloom" . (Even though Koreans were in japanese colonial exploitation in 1910).
Lmaooo the straw scene made me laugh so hard, coz I’m like dude that straw is was on the floor , don’t put it back in there 😂
no question for jung ho yeon? 🥺
우리 배우들 최고다👏👏👏🇰🇷
Jimmy is so fake no way … fake laugh , scream and excitement for no reason
All I have to say is “ this is not even the best kdrama of all” 😂😂😂 give kdramas a chance you will be surprised
Baby squid reminds me of the scene from Men in Black
다시봐도 멋진  오징어 게임. 이정재 멋지다.  오징어게임의 모든배우들에게 축복을..
What a Great show
baby squid <3 . 🥺🥺
Why did he completely ignore Jung Ho Yeon?  Ignoring the one female member of the cast, seems super disrespectful.  Poorly done Jimmy.
jimmy's so awkward
يعززون له عشان لايطردهم
low budget, great quality. Thumb UP!
i wanted to see ali aswell
The first day it was put on netflix, I was just looking for something to have on in the background, so I put on squid games. Ended up bingeing it that whole day! Made myself snacks and a mocha after episode one and that was my day 😂
I love squid game amazing k drama <3 Its the first time a k drama getting interview in america! Jimmy Fallon did a good job giving appropriate questions and hoyeon english is very good also pretty and cute. She is completely different compared when she on the k drama <3
YES I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY ARE IN TALK SHOWS NOW !!!!   IM SO HAPPY FOR THEM !!!!!!
i love all of them sm , especially wi-ha joon <3
I hope more people get accustomed to subtitles. For me the dialogue delivery, emotions and the actor's voice is very important. It excites me to explore more of their work.
Nah Jimmy has to stop stuttering like that🤨 we know it's not a condition and it honestly just makes him very difficult to understand. He tried to seem lost for words but it was just scripted.
Ali my favourite
I wish Ali was there too
Psycho robot Younghee is Judy in English. 'Tom & Judy' are 'Cholsoo 철수 & Younghee 영희'.
😀
I honestly think picked red light, green light as the first game was a very important choice. I'm from Germany so we sang something different as children but it was the same nevertheless. Everyone knows it and it simultaneously can take a ton of people out. That's exactly how you get a large audience all around the world to watch your show, especially paired with the world building. I mean who doesn't love masked guards, a remote island and huge money at the end?
Why the fuck is jimmy acting like an anime character, what a tosser
Was Jimmy nervous or something, he stuttered so much in 7 mins😭
awwwww theyre sooo cute 🥰
Love it
Hello hoyeon Jung your so 😍😍😍😍❤️ beautiful
OMG WHY DIDN'T YOU TALK TO HOYEON ALOT 🤧🤧🤧😭
Squid game is still number 1 in Germany! I binged the show in a day (as most of us did lmao) and it's just so worth it. It's easy to re-watch and still be amazed by the set design, acting and story.
강제 지미팰런쇼 출연 ㅋㅋ 세계 진출 ㅋㅋ
이 그림을 볼 수 있다니 .....
Who shed a tear watching Episode six 😢
jungjae is actually going to make his directing debut soon. the movie is called "hunt" and it's about the national intelligence service agents. he's going to star the movie alongside with another highly acclaimed actor (and his bestie lmao) jung woosung
Baby squid😍😍
Your great interview. Thank you for that.
next season: finding joon ho
Jimmy hyping them up 💕 It would've been much more fun if they could meet in person
Bebeklerim katılmış 🤍
Was Jimmy on coke here? Hahaha. He's acting like Tom Cruise on Oprah.
They should have included Ali
wi ha-joon the whole interview:😃
Best K-Drama I have watched this year is 'Bossam: Steal The Fate'.....historical drama.
Not giving any spoilers and proceeds to tell everyone that the contestants get shot if they move ...
Where is Ali, uncle and second female lead🥺🥺
These people are all so ridiculously good looking lol. I just love them.
한국인이라서 자랑스럽습니다. Let's learn korean!
ive been waiting for this
I loved park hae-soo ever since prison playbook.
they are so cute omg!!
Baby squid came as a blessing
Lame ass Jimmy Fallon gets Fallon makes $16 million a year as host not to be funny!!  😴😴😴🙄🤨
Please bring Ali to the show ❤️❤️
OMG HOYEONS ENGLISH IS SOO GOOD
actually jungjae is known to play a lot of cool, neat, and charismatic characters (he's a fantastic actor, really). so when he casted jungjae, the show's creator actually said his intention was to completely flip jungjae's sophisticated image into this disheveled, broke-ass loser .... which i think they nailed lmaooo
Jimmy so kind
Where is Frontman? he must be only dude in korea how can speak English.
Watching this as stranger things fan
The fact that it does hunger games better than hunger games is hilarious
Where are the VIPs everyone loves?
why didnt he ask hoyeon anything 😪
Ang cute ni ho-yeon, the way she talk uhhh heaven. Can wait to see you in Season 2 of Squid Game
New World
the way jim said their names 🤣
i love you Wi Han-Joon
Where's Ali?
baby squiiddd 😩
I'm so happy on how kdramas are being more recognized all over the world. I've been watching kdramas for 11 years and used to be picked on for liking kdrama.
should’ve shown Anupam Tripathi’s face in the clip :(((
Been a fan of Lee Jung-Jae for a long time. Very classic, great actor. You can find his charismatic acting on Korean film 'New World'
Hae soo park!!!! Love you!!!
He always laughing so fakely
AHH I was waiting for this to come out on YouTube yesss I love squid game
The insidious shampoo prudently interrupt because spear paradoxically spare despite a combative event. helpful, lean rutabaga
I love Wi- so much
But kang sea is dead 😥😭
We love jimmy show one of the bigest show in the world
I wanted to hear Jung Ho Yeon Talk abit more about her first time acting...🥺
Who are choongjae and hajin….
cutie hoyeon
watch squid game yall the best show ever
ALI SHOULDVE BEEN APART OF THE CAST
The erratic sand ethically tame because position undesirably camp amid a wandering tank. bustling, astonishing book
방탄 때문에 자주 봐서 그런가, 이젠 저 MC형이 한국사람 같아... 유창하게 한국말 써도 위화감 제로일 거 같음
BABY SQUID OMG, THIS IS MY COMFORT CAST <333
Jung Jae is one of the top actors in S.Kor, his character in movies were always impersonated by S.kor celebs all the time..like the two bullet thing
I LOVE THIS💗
wow. this is amazing
I watched Squid Game while I was having a fever. 🤒 Not recommended haha when you're ill. I'm still having PTSD or something 😅  It's soooo colorful I can't look away 😂
❤💛💙💚❤
So we won’t talk about how Ho-Yeon is actually good at English? It surprised me because even though I know that most idols & actors do learn English, the other 3 were speaking almost completely in Korean & I thought that she may do the same but her English is better than I thought. Love them anyways though 💪🏽❤️
jigeum right now - hae soo, CUTE OVERLOAD
Sooooo proud of you guys ~
Awesome interview. Squid game resonates with real people in modern society. The dark side and contradictions of when capitalism goes extreme, endless extreme competition, everything relating to money, greed and evilness that relates to all individual's story. The show resembles real life situations and systems we go through just a more extreme version of modern society. Not to mention their great acting, plots, design, etc. Masterpiece in various aspects.
Wow 😊
OBX????
WHERE IS ALI
Chong jae😭😭
OMGOOOSSSSHHHHH 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Must Watch  Hanjun in *18 Again* the Korean adaptation of the american Movie 17 again. It's a masterpiece.  Movie doesn't come close.
Jimmy and Squid game members - awesome. Kudos.  Admire you and your network for having interviews of foreign stars that require closed captioning.  Love it man, am 20 years older than you, but your show is the always fun and funny and great guests and games.   Steven and the 2 Jimmy's are all marvelous and am glad you are all Late night comrades as well.
But did you know that Park Hae-Soo Graduated from Sol govermental university?
why is jimmy stuttering so much?😂
"Biggest television show in the world!"  yesssss
It's crazy how whenever i used to tell people i watched kdramas, they always used to say that they were cringe and my choices sucked and now these very people are the ones going crazy after Squid Game ,which mind you, is a K drama. Proud to see these actors come so far. I have been following JUng jae since the beginnings of his career and am so proud to see him come so far.
One of the best series ever
YEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSS JIMMY THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fantastic serie
As a kdrama enthusiast, I feel SO proud and happy that a kdrama is getting the recognition it deserves. Squid Game definitely proves that "kdramas" doesn't always mean the typical rom-com dramas but also dark-thrillers. I know every kdrama fans are feeling the same <3  Also there are some other dramas that deserves the same recognition like, Kingdom, Extracurriculars, D.P., Mouse etc,. If you like dark-thrillers, these dramas are highly recommended.
grrrrrrrr
Baby squid 🐙 so cute 😍 congratulations to haesoo
He's right about the Korean kid's games drawing international people in. That was the most interesting part to me, it's fun to learn about that kinda thing
Were are the other actors??
AHH THEY ARE JUST SO PERFECT AND COOL
Where is Ali? Love that character....
I'm so happy for squid game team ...I feel like korean getting that recognition what they deserve since long  I hope other good series like kingdom, d.p. ,my mister, beyond evil etc (there are long list)or other amazing k-contents get recognized too
😍🙌🏻
Love these #squidgame cast ❤️ Each of them has unique and strong characters 👍👍👍
cheol-su and young-hee, the korean textbook pair hoyeon mentioned is basically jack and jill in Korea
other than squid game, I am so in love with kingdom and sweet home and is currently devastated for waiting too long now come on
I absolutely LOVE these interviews! Not letting language be barriers.
now if you havent already, go watch Prison Playbook because Park Hae Soo is just truly a GEMMMMM
"one is the boy, and one is the grrr"
jungjae is the sweetest i swear
Player 067 ❤️
*shows a clip from squid game* yep - i’m rewatching that..
Where's 001?
For whoever has watched the K drama "Prison Playbook" mustve relate on how it was impossible to hate sangwoo because its park hae soo :") I love him in prison playbook
"I wanna meet Jimmy brother, lol" *looks up ages, damn
They deserve all the recognition they are getting right now
OMGGGGGGGG
thank god he doesn't asked them what is their favorite american food
Fucking hate Jimmy Fallon with his fake ass laugh, but love the cast from Squid Game.
❤❤❤
I love 218 🥺
WI WI WIIIII 🥺🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
unpopular opinion: the actor who played Ali should be in this interview
I felt really sorry for Ali.. Who was cheated to death in the game.
Jimmy: I’m not giving any spoilers.  Jimmy: here is a clip Jimmy: he saved him!!  Lol 😂
우린 깐부 이니까
Hoyeon is QUEEN
i did a reaction to the first episode of this! loved the series, so proud and so excited to see more asian representation on screen! ☺️
미쳤다… 우리나라 최고 !!! 넘영감
Jimmy: No spoilers Also Jimmy: iF yOu MoVe YoU dIe
4:58 tiktok already give us a spoiler 😅
See? The Indian guy should be one of the main cast. Like, jung Jaein's character wouldn't be possible without Ali? Was it Ali his name? Yeah!
Hoyeon's english accent is soooo cute
It's number in the bahamas
JIMIN sweet person ☺️ he respect ☺️ to all
They are so good looking and charismatic!! Damn
I'm in love with all of them❤🛐
Hoyeon jung as kang sae byeok So cuteeee
Where's Ali ?  He's not the main character but he's the best character in the series
That improv story wasn't that funny at all and JF just laughed like a mad man. What was that? Gee
❤️❤️🥺
park hae soo trying to speak english was so wholesome for some reason
BABY squid, how cute!❤️❤️
Fabulous show
Korean Got Talent Korea Tiger Inkpainting https://youtu.be/p9irxsAGZLYᆢ(Korea Got Talent)호랑이 그림을 6분만에 그린다고.. https://youtu.be/MNQBgzYfcYw
jimmy kept saying "no spoilers" and then literally spoiled the first game
I think ali should have joined the show aswell
DESERVES THE HYPE. I recommend HOTEL DELUNA
Gracias Excelente invitación Nueva maravilla Coreana Exito!!!!💜
jung ho yeon keren!
I'm so happy for wi hajoon.
Park Hae Soo is such a gem. He deserves so much.
Another great kdrama movie Vincenzo. Check it out. 10/10
Ho Yeon english is so good!
One of the best series I've ever seen
Damn I thought they were gonna be live in the studio 🤨
Jesus jimmy is so fake
Jungjae 50 years old, omg
3rd repeat
주모오!!!!!
I watched it because of Gong Yoo, the cute slapping salesman, but Lee Jung Jae is starting to grow on me so I'm checking out his previous works.
I can hear the sound already that jealous Japanese and Chinese are talking in whispers LOL  * 댓삭하지 마라 죽는다
축하합니다. 전 미국에 사는데, 그냥 으쓱하네요. 감사합니다.
Bye, I can't get how they can be so cute after watching the program
Loveeee it
Is Jimmy drunk? 🤣
Wi Ha Joon 😍
E o ali ele merece também 🥺
I am so excited to see a Kdrama get such wide viewing and I hope this leads people to check out other Kdramas on Netflix. So much amazing programming! I also HIGHLY recommend watching in the original Korean with English subtitles and not dubbed.
But why ali is not here???
Blow up Vatican. pedo satan.
Omg SG supremacy!
I laughed so hard when Hae-soo said, " I wanna meet Jimmy brother (Hyung) "
Easter Egg   The man who made the game, Ihl-Nam, or 001, his name actually means “ First man “ , because in korean ihl ( 일 ) means one, and Nam comes from (남자 —> 남 ) which means man
Has no one watched Kaiji ?
All the 4 cast members are so attractive and humble ❤️❤️❤️
Do you like Lee Jung jae? You have to watch 'New world(신세계)'.
Ali should be here too. I just thought of him when the clip, wherein he saved gihun, was played
I'm so impressed with Ho Yeon's English skills, keep it up :)
i don't have anything against koreans , but why they doesn't learning english at school like every western country
Definitely a masterpiece.  i watched entire season in 1 go. Every single thing is so relatable.
Park Hyesoo is so sexy. Pity he is married!
캬 !!!!!!! 멋지다♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
영어가 한국어로 들리네.
OML
I've watched the whole interview with a smile on my face 😇
Ali deserves to be on the show as well
an amazing interview! Glad that jimmy asked great questions that really showed that they respect the cast and had done research before the interview! 👏🏻👏🏻
Lee jung jae! Loveeeeyou!
“its bigger than-“ what jimmy?
I wish they invited Ali also
Jimmy you're the best interviewer ever!!!! I love it!!!!!
Grr
Koreans: surprised that handsome leading actor like Jungjae acts as a loser-protagonist character The world: surprised that Jungjae looks handsome in real life rather than his shabby looks in the squid game
So he dosent ask the chick anything
The reason I signed up to Netflix! I have been in Kdrama world for 9 years in counting, dumped American TV and never looked back. Korea does it BEST. Bring on SUBTITLES.  Another Masterpiece
Squid gane is the best
She is my wife 😍
Omg!!!!!!!
im glad jimmy didn't ask those kind of questions like "what is your favourite english word" 😭 kuddos to you jimmy i know i could trust you
무궁화꽃이피었습니다
🦑
When would do they do the meet and greet in USA
It's the first time I've been so in love to the cast of a show. I LOVE THEM SO MUCH AHHH
I could never hate Hae-Soo because of the prison playbook 😂
MY MOST FAVOURITE PEOPLE IN ONE VIDEO I'LL CRY
The way he said their names like it’s a fan chant at a Kpop concert! I’m deaddddd 😆
is it just me or jimmy is annoyed that they’re speaking korean?
I used to think that doll is anabelle😂
HAESOO MY MAN 🛐
Loved squid game 🦑
하..너무귀여워 ㅠㅠㅡㅠ 4명다사랑해
jung ho yeon is so stunning
<3333
i was waiting for him to interview ho yeon 😑
Finally! ;3
ahhh I love this show I’ve watched it twice and i wanna watch it again!! And I’m so happy wi hajoon is finally getting the recognition he deserves!! btw if anyone of you is looking for another great korean netflix show i highly recommend extracurricular!! it gives you the same depression as squid game and also shows the hardships of the lower class and the shocking things people (this time high school students) do for money and a better future, so basically same energy different concept!!
Jimmy definitely didn't watch the show yet lmao
Hoyeon: “and shes the one 💄😁💅🌸🌞🌈🍬🍭✨✨” Jimmy: YAH.
He said no spoilers but spoiled the red light green light twist lmaooo
YAZZ KOREAN WAVE TAKING OVERRR
Never seen Jimmy as a fanboy fukboy until he shit squids
Squirt Game 😂
I hope Anupam, he played Ali, gets to be on The Tonight Show
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
BACK IN FIVE SECONDS AAAA
I love this cast so much they all seem so nice and humble I wish that this can bring them a lot more opportunities in the future , also huyeons laugh I can't 🤧
jimmy’s fake laugh 💀
aww that's adorable
I hope these subtitles are good
#JusticeForAli
They're all amazing 😭 ...also their smileee😭😭😭
Oh my god her shoessssss! 😍
The dislikes are from all the people who eliminated
SHOULD BRING THE MAIN VILLAIN...the gangster guy
Im glad rgey chose jimmy fallon and not the other hosts
The subtitles is so big 😭😭😭
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD do not watch it dubbed 💜 listen to the characters voices, their emotions, appreciate the Korean culture 💜💜 I love being Korean and I feel so proud of my country 😍
WI HA JUN. That’s my comment.  Also search Lee Jung Jae during his younger days. You’re welcome.
the show's great but i dont like the ending tho
Jimmy's giving me second hand embarrassment
this is quite amazing i love that they deserveDD to be known internationally🤗
Faltou o Anupam Tripathi
The F? OVERRATED!!!!!!!!
Why is he stuttering so much?
meu deus eu amo mt eles
I am crazy in love with a girl I have never met before and her name is Jung Ho-yeon. One of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen. To me she's like the Korean Marilyn Monroe when it comes to overall beauty. ^_^ I just finished binge watching Squid Game and it's one of the greatest shows I have ever watched. AMAZING! :D
BTS, Parasite, Squid Game South Korea domination!
❤️
Wi ❤️❤️❤️
For some reason, Wi Ha Joon looks like a shark and idek why
Fun fact: Lee Jung Jae is actually Blackpink Jennie’s mom favorite actor. Jennie was named after him. Jae > Jennie
Patiently waiting for people to discover Indian music 🌚
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🙌
It’s sad hoyeon only got to speak once
제발 외국어 가능한 분들 해외여러분께 알려주세요..이정재는 초절정 미남이라고,,,제발 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
I cannot find words to describe how proud I am of park hae soo! He was literally meant to be an actor and be on TV! His looks, his voice, his acting skills, his talent, all screams perfection. He’s a living LEGEND! And now him talking about his son and calling him “baby squid” Just melted my heart! It’s literally so adorable🥺 look at that big smile on his face while talking about his son! 🥺💖 congratulations on your newborn baby boy hae soo 🤍
he want to meet jimmy butler i hear
Jimmy is the best
Ok but no ones gonna talk about how handsome Wi Ha Joon is????😩😩😌😌
I am soo in love and addicted to this movie/series😭❤️
호연씨 그냥 한국어로 대답해주셔도 되지 않을까요..? 굳이 영어 안 써도....
Another TV show from Korea that I love it is "Crash landing on you", you can laugh hard and sobbing in the same episode. Its so so good this drama. The characters, scenography, the storyline, everything was did by an incredible crew. I love the Korean TV shows. I never seen anything like this before on American TV shows.
오예
Lee Jung Jae DILF NATION WHERE YOU AT?
Baby squid 😂😂😂
So cuteee
BEST CAST AWARDS
Wi ha joon looks so good can't take my eyes off him😍
hae soo is too adorable for a father :<< daddy squid
Wow jung-jae cleans up well!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Fell in love with her on squid game she is such a babe
Jimmy fallon is my favorite late night show
baby squid 😂😂
i thought ha joon could speak english lol 😂
So cool to see them do an interview on american tv but wish it’d been with an less awkward interviewer
People who are not much aware of Korean dramas and movies industry, Lee Jungjae (Gi-hun) does not really do much dramas as much as he does movies. He rarely does dramas that his last one was from 2 years ago, and all his projects are really worth watching! Superb acting and a very very versatile actor!
I love all of them so muchhh!!
I loveeeee them!!
Chulsoo and younghee are well known name in Korea. Like Michael and Thomas in English name. So when students get textbooks in school, the names are always an example in dialogues. So Direct Han (Squid game) considered even a small detail and penestrated human's pure memories.
I wonder if Korean idols and actors get trained to be so humble and act likeable or if it is just their personality 🤔
Can't wait for season 2...
OMG REAALLY WHERE IS 67 and 29
A brilliant black comedy on human nature. Cast is superb.
IM SO PROUD
haesoo became MY DAD when squid game premiered 😌
All of them are so beautiful but the red sweater guy and the girl 🤤🤤 so stunning 💗
The part where the doll shoots them is kinda of a spoiler jimmy. 😂 But it is what it is, cuz why would you watch this interview without watching the show first.
they are amazing!!
I love the lead guy he’s so adorable & cute
Lee jung Jae is one of the best actor in Korea. Some of his movies makes parasite look mediocre. How are people just finding out about him?
My cousin singing the squid game's song almost the hole day 💜
❤
Love them. They are amazing!😄👍💜
The pink hazard suits looked so low budget.
AHHHHH
Hoyeon has good accent tho
박해수 배우 아빠된 것을 미국 지미팰런쇼에서 알게 된 한국인... 👍🏻 이정재 너무 멋져서 자랑스러워요.
Justice for Ali
Is Jimmy on something?
I’m obsessed with her shoes
they’re so cool
대박 JF쇼에서 한국어 진행을 몇 주에 한번씩 보게되는 시대를 살게되다니...ㅎㅎ
I didn't know that Sae-Byeok's actress is very fluent in English
Hoyeon's english is so Good👆
Hoyeon's english is so Good👆
are there even audience?
How is jimmy is so annoying and so over the top. The cast is amazing tho :)
So nice! 🥳
Ali and Uncle were missing, they're also strong pillars for series success.
They should bring ali too
The cast is so adorable and talented! Thanks Jimmy for addressing each one so respectfully! and they are hot!!!
Where is my queen han min yeo?
Lee Jung-jae finally became a king like he said before  " 어디, 내가 왕이 될 상인가? "
I wish Jimmy has asked Hoyeon more questions!!! She's so pretty
GOO SQUID GAME!!
Love this interview best one yet
Hahahahaha so fun. Love this!!!!!
They everyone’s favourite Group right now 😍
Jung-jae's smile is brighter than my future
지나치게 충격적으로 재미있었던 작품이고 인물들.
Really pretty ,
Jimmy is so fake :)
Jimmy is cringe af
Jimmy your laugh is so fake and obvious like at least act well
Baby squid Ddu du du ddudu~
I just realized the way some of the character dies is the same way to what they did to others. 1. Sa byeok died getting stabbed in the neck, the way she threatened the guy to slit his throat if he failed to bring her mom to south korea. 2. Sang Woo died in a suit, the way he wanted to die by suicid* in the bathtub before coming back to the island. 3. Ali died because Sang Woo stole his pebbles, the way he stole his employers money. 4. The asshole Deok su and detective Joon Ho died falling from heights as they do the same to their enemies. (Deok Su jumped off a bridge and det. Joon Ho killed a guard and throw him to the sea.)
Bruh you didn’t really ask her any questions😩
They just work for Illuminati. I’m a korean but hate korean drama as hell.
It’s cool seeing the Korean actors on American talk shows, South Korea has been producing some quality films for a while
이정재의 매력은  아직  다드러나지 않았다. 너무 멋진 사람들 ,
I'm starting to feel the cast is a family more than anything...
YESSSSSS
Thats ali who saved him hehehehe
방송이 뭔가 좀 허접하게 진행되네
So nice to see them but I wish Ali was also here.  He was one of the main character but he is missing in all of the interviews.
watch the movie 'deliver us from evil'. you can see real Lee Jung jea
Jimmy was the one who was awkward
I still hate that second guy
where can i watch this full? link plz
When u r curious bout how lee jung-jae acts bad ass brutal villain, watch korean film “Deliver us from evil(2020)”
Actually I speak English
sjsusjsuswush
OSCAR smell for squid game
是因为自己喜欢别人就不喜欢他什么都没有的东西
Why is Anupam Tripathi is not in the show..he is also one of the main characters
Hey America, you see, subtitles are not a big deal, right?
Come oooon Jimmy, Ha Jun is not that hard to pronounce!!!
like they deserve this
I WANT MORE INTERVIEWS 😩 😫
So happy to see them having the success that they deserve!
If anyone watched Lee Jungjae for the first time through squid game, try to watch K movies like ''deliver us from evil', 'new world', and 'The face reader'. You'll be shocked to see how strong and charismatic he is in his movies. Btw, he is almost 50 in Korean age
They deservesd this much appreciation 💜
But..... But..... HoYeon 😍😩
Where is Ali????
worldwide trending.
The moaning circulation potentially satisfy because pig ethnopharmacologically rock afore a alike date. warm, acidic saturday
ذا حرق المسلسل كله مين راح يشوفه😭
Two met sat exactly the same way in the beginning 😯
I'm wondering why's ali is not in there?
이게 다인가? 너무 짧다
You all rock, this show had me stressed!! Fantastic series!!
Overated garbage!!!
The thing is - I loved everything about Squid Game, it was great from the beginning till the end and the cast was chosen perfectly, but if this is the first Korean drama you've watched, then I must enlighten you that South Korea makes great dramas in general. The romance ones may seem restrained and definitely less explicit (sex scenes are rare), but when it comes to thriller, crime and mystery ones, Kdramas are in my opinion the best. Unfortunately, only recently they've started adding shows on Netflix, mostly the new ones, but there are other streaming sites where you can watch them with subtitles, such as Viki. On Netflix my favorite ones are Flower of Evil (though it's unavailable in my country now) and Kingdom. The Lies Within is good too.
Surprised that they didn't asked any americanized ass questions
The Cast:  Jimmy: HAHAHAHA COME ON YESSSS WOOOWW OMG
I wish he asked hoyeon more questions
Man I am in love with this cast. I hope they all do something with director  Park Chan-wook
Lol... Baby squid!
Yassss!!! I love all this asian representation
Lee jung jae best actor ☑
This series is freaking awesome 🔥
Real humble cast. Love it!!!!
Lee Jung Jae the best actor of 2021 bye-
I can hear already that the jealous Japanese and Chinese are talking in whispers LOL
Jimmy: not giving any spoilers tonight also Jimmy: literally spoiling the first game
OMG WI HA JOON IS SO HANDSOME
"Hae-soo, when did you realize the show became so big? * "JiGeUm right now" *😂
I don't have any fingernails left after watching it.
how much i love them ❤️❤️😍
It's so beautiful to see that at even this big International Platform,  people prefer to speak in their  NATIVE LANGUAGE
But where is Ali🥲
Baby Squid
I don't get the appeal of this show??
The reason behind their continuing successes isn't just their production skills, Korean culture has good virtues that the globe can share all together.
Where is the actor who played ali
MY BELOVEDS
Awwww man...they just didn't show the Indian face....and the pose they made....it's just iconic
박해수가 유난히 긴장을 많이 했네 ㅋㅋ
Why is jimmy stuttering sm
so humble and adorable Just like the parasite cast I hope this drama will open doors to more Korean production and works
About time Korean dramas got worldwide recognition!
awww baby squid 🥺
Fantastic!!!! Thanks Jimmy!!!!
Did he just call him Wi Hanjin 💀
I'm literally so obsessed with Squid Game it's not even funny
They all look like a good man in squid game
Baby squid .... cutee, he really is a lucky charm
PLEASEEEEE MORE SHOWS FOR THEMMMMM!!!
so not funny
Not gonna lie, I was thinking about watching just because of the hype, but the way Jimmy promoted and showed this lil clip made me wanna watch it for real👏🏾👏🏾
Could have asked the girl a question or two.
GURR
ㅔ짠나나타즈ㅡ탸ㅏ
Jungjae and Haesoo speak so well, they are really pros 👏🏾👏🏾 Hoyeon is so cute speaking english ❤️ Hajoon is so handsome oh Lord…
난 영어를 못 하는데 왜 이걸 보고있지?
The world was first addicted to money heist and now it’s squid game
1:42 , omg jung ho-yeon’s laugh is so cuteee
Lee jung jae looks so good wtf
I am so happy for finally kdrama getting world recognition which is well deserved😭❤👏🏼
I was hoping for real interview🤡
Woww is this the first time jimmy fallon had a korean actors on the show? The korean culture sure is growing in America
So amazing the story about the doll girl being from Korean text books
South Korean things taking over the worldd!!!
Lee Jungjae is an amazing actor.
my parents don’t watch kdrama or any of the sort. But when i introduced to them to this show, they finished it first without me (T-T). I can see why it got so globally popular—even my parents enjoyed it.
If you could watch this interview with subtitles then you can watch the show with subtitles. 🙃
아닠ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 지미아저씨 이여어어ㅓㅓㅓ 뭔뎈ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 한국 아저씬줄 알았자나….
Jimmy is litteraly stuttering becouse of his nervousness and he is making me feel akward if i was him talking to them 😹😹
South Korea is such a fountain of creativity and talent! Jealousy inducing soft power without even trying. One squid game star creates more soft power than all the Confucius institutes put together
Jimmy thanks SO MUCH FOR INVITING THIS AMAZING CAST!!!
The cast is so adorable and loved how Jimmy addressed each one so respectfully!
A big I NEED AN INTERPRETER moment but OK
The background speaks #LeniRobredo2022
I feel like Jimmy was very high during this interview
How do they know what Jimmy is saying and how does Jimmy know what they’re saying? Besides Hoyeon Jung bc she was speaking English
Why didn’t Jimmy ask Ho-Yeon any direct questions like he did the other actors?  She answered a question but it wasn’t necessarily directed at her or even about her.  Why can’t I help but think that’s problematic?
Congratulations to all the cast of Squid Games👍🥰💯🎉💕♥️💖💖👏💪🤚🖖💘
Where's Ali?
“Im not giving any spoilers tonight” - 3min before explaining red light green light game hahaha
Me after watching korean dramas/series for 3yrs now, i rarely watch hollywood movies/american series already. Lol. They just have great stories and not every drama/series released would be the same. And their series, do not drag on to 2 or 3 seasons no matter how good it is. But still, i love some american series or hollywood movies though.
2:15 that skin though!! Glowing!!!
He became a dad and a daddy when squid game premiered
Awesome interview! But where's Ali?! I was so happy to see all of Koreans represented, including the SEAsian/foreigner and the North Korean defector~.
Where is Tripathi??!?
wow
hoyeon is so cute 😭
I swear to God, Koreans (and Asians in general) are very talented and so resourceful, they can make the best movies, tv series, about any topic, for everyone's tastes...they would make a song about a banana and make the best choreography for it and have the best vocals and visuals in it! They really deserve all the love and recognition in the world  and that comes from someone who is not very much into kdrama-kpop in general. EDIT: Ofc talent is everywhere in the world, it's not about a specific culture or race.. my comment is just addressed for those who consider that korean drama is only about soapy, "cheap" romance movies, and that kpop is about idols dressing like "girls" and nothing else.. ✌🏻😇
Ohhh my god... I don't know how to put it but they are so amazing. everyone knows that i don't need to say....
Does anyone know where those amazing shoes from Jung Ho-yeon are from?
jung jaes ankles HELLO
haesoo my beloved he looks so good in that fit
У этих четверых очень много свободного времени я вижу
I want more Squid Game seasons.... they really should make more, it's quite addictive, I don't want the show to end it needs to keep going, seasons by seasons with lots and lots of episodes.
Wi Haa Joon is my baby daddy
THEY ARE SO FRIGING CUTES AHBWHWHekeie
Oh my god , unexpected to see them in here 🥺 I'm glad Squid game made this such big hit, top 1 among 90 countries , awww they all deserve thisssss 🥰
Where’s ali? Huhu
Solo espero que ahora respeten a los asiáticos y sepan y aprendan que la xenofobia está mal,por otra parte este elenco de actores es increíble
this is such a big moment for them and so well deserved!!!
I'm just curious how does jimmy understand them without a translator. Is it scripted or jimmy knows korean?
Thank MARINE CORP for the fight, otherwise those people could be filming for north Korean leader now.
국뽕 치사량
so lovely to see them on Jimmy's but where is the Indian guy, Ali? He would make a good English translator.
legend how a kdrama made it this big.Other kdramas are just as good
Everyone saying that Jimmy spoiled something from the shows, when it was literally in the trailer 😭
I'm in love with 067 and the love only grows more. WHY IS SHE SO ADORABLE
💫💫
korea having the recognition it deserves
정말 글로벌하네 ㅎㅎ
Ali should've been on Jimmy Fallon's interview.
this is all? It was too short than I expected.
오! 한국이름 발음이 정확함
Anupham Thripati (sorry if I spells his name wrong) should be in interview also
세상에 진짜 신기한 일이여 ............... 한국 컨텐츠가 어떻게 이렇게 성공할 수가 있지 대박이여 ,,,
Too bad they didn't invite the actor of Ali to this show
I love the English accent of Hoyeon jong 😍
I recommend you guys  see the movie  "신세계".
Amazing Actors, AMAZING SHOW!! Cant wait for season 2!!!
thank you all for releasing this upon us we needed this its amazing how something so awesome can bring ppl together the show is great it reminds you what its like to be a kid again with the games also the twist of playing the simplest games at a cost great work to the whole cast
I was smiling this whole time. 😍😌love them.
No jimbo. Jun jae not always the villain, he was the main romantic lead of the original LAKE HOUSE called IL MARE!
mygosh i'm so happy! i love that they're here! i love these actors so much. 💜
'무궁화 꽃이 피었습니다' 실제 게임 룰은 조금 다름..ㅠㅠ 심플하게 변경해서 이해는 쉽지만 오리지날 게임 룰 소개 해주면 더 재밌을건데
hoyeon speaking english is soooo cuteeee
For the coming decades South Korea going to be a force to be reckoned
너무 멋지당!
That's quite a long journey for South Korea hallyu project. I remember Winter Sonata, Wonder girls, Jang Nara started knocking at my country door decades ago. Now Squid Game, BTS, Blackpink conquering the world up to US.. Kudos to korean people 🥲 Fighting!! 💪
Hottest cast
I’m so glad they made it on Jimmy Fallon, they deserve the world.
https://youtu.be/xRVucq2gXT0  The best villian character of lee jung jae
Fucking sangwoo but Park Hae Soo is so cute 🥺
Lee Jung Jae is so charismatic and an excellent actor. I recommend his "Deliver Us From Evil" movie, one of the best!
I wish they would have Ali's actor on these promos because he speaks fluent English and Korean. He would've been a great conduit between so many cultures.
I like how YouTube think squid game is a parasite movie and that its recommending it to me 💀
It’s 2:47am rn and I have school so this is is keeping me awake from sleeping :,)
시발 이제 애국가에 오징어게임 넣다
They are so perfect mannnn wow 😍
If you came watching this video even before watching the show, then its your fault lol the show's been released for like 3 weeks so dont complain if people spoil it for yoy
You guys loving other casts in there but I watched it because of wi ha joon he's not really that famous yet but I just wanna know that he deserves the best! I love him!! ✨❤️
Seeing them together like this makes me so happy!!!
they should have added a few more seconds to the clip to show the stakes and how ali is struggling to hold him up! i think their tension and interaction as the robot inspects them is a much more compelling sequence than the cut they chose.  if not that, i think a better clip to show from the first ep would be something from the middle of red light green light, where the understanding of the game has set in so there’s this element of desperation, as well as the tension of attempting to steel yourself physically and mentally against violence that you would normally flinch at if not completely run screaming from. a tension which contrasts beautifully with moments like the old man semi-playfully moving forward or the part where sae-byeok is holding the shitty dudes hair and threatening to pull.   or, another good clip may be where everyone is screaming out their objections and questions in the crowd before the first game, at least to give the audience some context about the conceit of the show (which i don’t think jimmy explained that well). but maybe they didn’t want to have to have people speaking korean and having to read subtitles on american tv because americans are extremely averse to things not catered to them specifically 🙄  tldr i think the clip was definitely not one i would pick for a 20-30 second clip of the first ep, both story wise and cinematographically. there are just so many moments that are far more intriguing that would make me interested in watching if i haven’t yet heard of it.
Can't actually believe how Squid game has spread like a wild fire..well deserved ☑️☑️
Saving lives even in effed up times - that's how we browns roll 😎✌
This show is absolutely amazing asf a whole 10/10 and the cast is beautiful and gorgeous 😍😩
배우님들 멋지십니다 ~~
To all the viewers and who loved the squid game..You shouldn't want to miss Money By Lisa of Blackpink https://youtu.be/dNCWe_6HAM8 This is Ost of Squid Game. Thank you
South Korea taking over the world , we love to see it 🤷‍♀️
Just a decade ago, I was a little upset because there were many people confused between South Korea and North Korea, but in recent years, I am so grateful that there have been so many proud moments of being a South Korean.😭
The game, red light green light is called the game "무궁화꽃이 피었습니다.(mu gung hwa kkoch -i pi eoss seub ni da : mugunghwa has bloomed)" in Korea. It's 10 letters. The reason why they use that words is to count 10.
와 대박
Am I the only one that thinks Jimmy Fallon made this awkward?? He just kept on repeating the same thing and just saying obvious stuff like 3:19 annoyed me 😭
I like the fact that Jung Ho-yeon speaks english  very well
yes thank you jimmy for asking good questions about the show and the actors themselves
Thank you Jimmy for the amazing interview! It was awesome! We know we can always count on you
HA JOON IS SO FINE WHAT THE FAWK
I never watched squid game but i know that Wi HaJun guy, mostly act as 2nd lead actor.. I guess he's famous now
why all the spiritual people(christian or buddhist no matter) demanding this or that to hard working people? without doing nothing or return? while spread word of satan?
A rama dan ???
Where is ALI????
Since we are here, I highly recommend other Korean Netflix series from this year like DP or Move to Heaven ;)
The world loves Squid Game not just because of the survival game. It reflects our deepest desire, sins, and hopes.
근데 지미팰런 인터뷰 뭔가너무 어색하고 ᆢ억지웃음같고 ᆢ저만 그렇게 느낀걸까요 👀;
You’ve already given a spoiler that doll shoots people.
Every cast is talented.
Korea best korea number 1
jimmy fallon is so stiff i guess i might be a better interviewer lol
I think what makes Squid Game good is that you can connect, relate & symphatize with the characters and understand their choices even though it's wrong. I watch other show with similar concepts like Alice in Borderland but I can't connect nor care as much to the characters there as I do to Squid Game and that show have even better games. For Squid Game, I even cried in Ep.6 during the marble game esp. when the characters I cared for died even though I know for a fact that they will die anyway as only 1 will win which will obviously be Gihun as he is the main character.
AAAAAA HO YEON LOOKS SO PRETTYYYY
Where is my man ali🥺 btw i love these cast so much especially seo byok ❤️‍🔥
WI HA JOON IS SO FINE OH GOSH
Well deserved ❤️🖤 🎉💥
Jimmy and his fake laugh.
Jimmy sounds more American than usual
loving this show more & more 😋💕
Oh my Wi Hajunnnnnnnn 🤩
Now interview Ali please
ALI SHOULD BE IN HERE ALSO  He acting is amazing and many people love him 💕
You have to watch "New World". It's Lee Jung-Jae's real masterpiece. It's a movie about an infiltrated cop in a Mafia clan.
HOYEON SO CUTE
No spoilers other than revealing people get shot when they lose. That's a pretty big initial spoiler.
I don't think squid game is the biggest show surely it is stranger Things
4:59  "i'm not giving any spoliers tonight" but you just did Jimmy, while explaining what the doll does :')
This was the best show I have ever watched in a long time.  watching over 3 inches of subtitle barrier wasn't too bad at all; I mean it was well worth it!  Great show and kudos to these actors.  Thank you for this epic show!
They made gi hun look sooooo much older in the show☠️
👍🏻
they died I-
Oh I didn't know Haesoo's child is born like 10 mins before Squid Game airs. LOL That is so cool. The kid's nickname though... baby squid! 😆
I'm cringe so many time in this interview...
When I decided to watch the first ep, I kind of promised myself that I wouldn't get attached to any character, even the actors, on the show. But then the sixth ep came and here I am lol The cast is just too good
Thank you for having squid game. Ugh I love this show so much! 💚 The casts are amazing and deserved the fame and love theyre getting right now.
That forced laugh was sooo uncomfortable…
Can Fallon stop with the fake second hand embarrassment laughs??!..
Lee jung jae ❤️  so handsome ✨✨
I was ahead of the curve on this one, I have been into Kpop and Kdrama for years.
you guys have to watch "new world" (신세계)
jimmy had a seizure wtf
Jung Ho-Yeon is so cute😍.
they’re amazing LOVE THE CAST        and crushing on hoyeon 😍😩
지미씨가 감격해서 당황하셨나? ㅋ 말을 더듬으시네?
I wish Ali would be apart of the interviews too 😩‼️
OMG~~~~~!!!!!
Love it 👏 But, I'd love to see the other actors of Squid Game on your show too (Player 001, 199, 212)... ❤
Hajun~~~~♥♥♥
But I miss Anupam Tripathi ❤️
aaaaa
This interview was so awkward.
Have been Hae Soo fan since Prison Playbook now and he finally gets the recognition he deserves. Reading comments not only about his look but also his acting made me feel so proud. He’s really a versatile actor out there. I hope his career will advance more since he has so many projects in his bag right now, esp Money Heist remake as Berlin.
👍🦑❤️
jung hoyeon please give me ONE chance🤧
Great interview! Everyone should watch Squid Game and other nationalities shows in general.
Jimmy gave the world wide reaction 😂 cute
💜💜💜💜💜💜
Why the interview is too short
I didn’t like the trailer of the show and decided not to watch it. My sister watched 5 episodes and told me it was amazing and I had to watch it. I’m so glad I did 😍 amazing show
영어 못해도 쉬운 영어밖에 없어서 알아듣기 쉽구만
Another korean masterpiece
why wasn't ali there :/
Jimmy really needs to work on his fake laugh... 😓... n why is Jimmy calling Wi Ha Joon as Ha Jin?
너무 자랑스럽습니다!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️ 캐나다에서 살고있는데 BTS이후로 이렇게 많은 관심을 받은게 처음이네요!
man I’m feeling a lot of secondhand embarrassment watching Jimmy laugh like that throughout the interview
chang ho-yeon is the only one who said the smoothest english
The fact that Kdramas are now getting the recognition they WELL deserve
Best Series everrrrrrr
I watched it twice. Intriguing masterpiece! 🦑🐙🎮🎯
Koreran food is my favourite cuisine, now this!!!!  whhaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!
muy corta la entrevistaa
absolutely amazing actors/actresses talented af.
위하준 사랑해요 하❤️
I am waiting for season 2 because I really feel bad for joon ho 🥺 I hope he is still alive in drama 🤞❤️
Lee Jungjae, the main character in squid game, is one of the most well known and beloved top actors in Korea. He's been in the industry over 35 years. He played this below average loser character for the first time in squid game, but he normally plays a very charming, charismatic, or evil character in movies. I was actually quite shocked to see him playing such a loser character in.squid game because I was only used to seeing him playing strong, charismatic characters in movies. He did an amazing job though
"Speaking native language"   yes.
3:43 Just leaving this here 😁
'Fly to the moon' voice is good!
"baby squid" omg so cute 🤩
🤍🤍
와 이름 부르는데 발음이 너무 정확해 ㄷㄷ 얼마나 연습했을지... 대단해 진짷ㅎ
Watch " As the gods will " Jp movie
Jimmy I need episode 2 with crazy girl, foreign worker Ali, gangster with tattoo, Ji-young,  the brother...
Hoyeons English was amazing  And also, (I know everyone’s commented about this but still) Baby squid!! That’s just cute!
Jimmy Thank You. 😊 I'm an Army but BTS introduced me to all of the other talents thank you for appreciating 💜 them
I’m just sad the actor who played ALI wasn’t part of the main cast of Squid Game. People literally talking about him and loves his role! I hope he gets the same recognition and will have the chance to talk about his experience being casted as a foreigner and will not just became the Barbs of Stranger Things.
Why is Jimmy an interviewer if he can't articulate half a word? Anyways the cast is lovely
이렇게 보니 4명 다 진짜 연예인이네.. 뭔가 드라마에서 볼땐 친근한 일반인 같은 느낌이 있어서 그랬는지
WI HA JOON ❤️
This is such a good show, if you havent watch you simply must, terribly heartbreaking, exciting, thrilling, and so many twists and turns.
Um... he didn't ask the one woman on the couch, Jung Ho-yeon a question...
Park Hae Soo looks damn good 🧎🏻‍♀️😌✋🏼
Jimmy’s fake laugh   4:55
Hoyeon accent is so fluent she improved alot!
did he say jimmy brother???? HAESOO DONR DO THIS TO MY HEART
Oh ma god the baby is so lucky
They are amzing!! They made me proud.👍👍
Just seven minites……
I've seen Wi Ha Joon several times in dramas and he always got supporting roles, so it's really mindblowing to see his popularity rocketing in a blink of an eye.
Jimmy is so awkward..lol😅
I'm glad they are getting international recognition and attention. They all are such great actors/actress.
park haesoo is so damn fine i'm crying screaming banging my fist sliding on the doorr
LMAO he look soo fake
Jimmy i love you so much such a amazing emcee ever!! Jung Jae look fine as hell
Ummmmm when did this happend 😲😲😲😲😲😲😳😳😳😳😳
Reminder-  with subtitle not dubbed. Thanks
Important points from this: 1- Jung Ho-Yeon is stunning... and yes girl I see them shoes. 2- the show secured its Emmy. 3- Jimmy is still kinda cringy but we're just here for the cast. 4- I know he was a snake in the show but Park Hae-soo could get it get it ngl.
I’m so proud 😭🥺
where is ali
연예가중계 보는줄ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
THEY ARE SO CUTE
Gi-hun is a bad son and a good son. You'd love to hate him and then can't help but root for him without you realizing it.
hae-soo looks so fine in this interview😫
Hi chimmy 💜😊👋 so proud of them
The show and the cast deserve all the love. Dasurv!! 💘💘💘💘💘
Jimmy say's no spoiler but he already did tell about the doll HAHAHAHA
THEY ARE SO FVCKING CUTEEEE
squid game >>> money heist
ouuuuuuuu look at hoyeon jung😭
Sae byeok was my favorite character I hope the theories turn out to be true that she survived for season 2 😢
Ok but why you totally ignore her and didn’t ask her a proper question? She was very interesting the the tv show, plus, the only one that speaks English 🙄
Way to spoil the entire 1st episode and the hook of the entire show, Jimmy 🙄
Actors take away all the LIMELIGHT but what about the SCRIPT writer? He is the reason for this show to exist. We should've been listening to his thought process behind such a masterpiece and what he wanted to convey through the show.
Wow she speaks really good English. I thought all 4 were strictly Korean. Learn something new everyday
💜💗💜💗
i freaking adore this cast
Squid game and Alice in Borderland are some of the best shows out there in this genre.
His laugh is so fucking fake.
‘Baby squid’ awwwww I can’t that’s so cute
Omg omg omg love them so much
I loved the way How wi ha joon described why squid game attracted global attention.
Lee Jung Jae was in the movie Face Reader (관상) as a villain. In this movie, theres great casts like Song Gang Ho who was the lead cast in the movie Parasite. Theres a reason they say Jung Jae is like a chameleon, his acting is great. In Face Reader, he’s so villain-y!
so contrived. YawNNNN
PARK HAE SOO 🥺
No way...!! Squid Game's hot Korean cast members appeared on American shows and enjoyed recording talk shows?? Even though this was a hit all over the world, it was a real hit...
congrats haesoo for your 1st child
“right now” i love him
헤이 친구들~ 백신 맞고 한국으로 놀러 와.
I'm a big fan of HaeSoo.so I'm gald that people in the world know him how he is a great actor.^^
Deeply obsessed with this show and cast
gracias jimmy
Glad to see more SQUID GAME cast interviews, I've been craving them.
jimmy nervous
Jimmy brother 😍😍😍
I haven't watched the whole series just the 1st episode and last episode  😆 (GONG YOO)
Awww he had his baby on the premier, that's so friggin cute aghhhh
OMG WI HA JOON
They're so damn good looking
They are all so attractive!!
Slater Young debut
Why is Jimmy laughing so much? Even when there's nothing funny, bro chill
In so many ways It reminded me of a well written anime it was so reminiscent of some of my favourite shows growing up, it was captivating 😁❤️
God damn the North Korean girl!! 😍
Gong yoo you should hve been thre with them at Jimmy Fallon n love to see u too... Love you Jimmy Fallon u r just amazing person.... 💜
The great thing about Korean parallel Cinema is that there is no concept of an all conquering hero like most of Hollywood. Common folks , people with issues, anti heroes etc make the movies and stories so good. Not everyone enjoys it but they are a class apart
“She’s the one” no girl you’re the one come here
DUDE I'M LITERALLY CRYING NOW TWT.... BABY SQUIDDD <33
S.Korea got Samsung, LG, Hyundai, Kia, BTS, BlackPink, Parasite, now Squid Game! K(orean)-Cultures at its Best and getting Popular All Over The WORLD! :) Yes, Nice Work!!!
How the gang grew from starring as second leads in kdramas to getting the well deserved recognition from squid game .😭😭😭
Jimmy didn't talk or ask her anything.  I am not happy.  I found it rude.  I am glad she spoke on her own or we wouldn't have even heard her speak.  Sorry for not knowing her name.  She is a pure angel!!!  ❤️❤️❤️
so cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo;~
Love Jimmy Fallon , presenting  the show with love and respect ,chill at the same time making the cast comfortable !! Not like other Show
와 나 솔직히 소름 돋아..........중학교 부터 외국 배우 파면서 한글 자막 찾아보거나 직접 달았는데 이번엔 자막이 필요 없어....할리우드 배우 많이 나오는 프로그램이나 쇼 같은거에 아이돌이나 배우들 나와서 넘넘 신기해....봐라 외국인들아 한국이 세계다하아하하하하하하
Americans are likable. They are reasonable, open, and good. You can see it through the comments.💯
I love that Jimmy's so well versed with all of his guests. The ones that don't speak any English to many that speak some like BTS. He treats them so nice. You'd even think they've been friends for quite some time.  You are a great guy Jimmy Fallon 🤯😉🤗🤟
멋져 멋져 ~
한국인임에 자랑스럽습니다~ 멋진배우들 화이팅!
To all those ppl making fun of me for watching kdramas  WHERE ARE YALL NOW ? Watching squidgame ?
오ㅓ 진짜 타오른다 국뽕 주모 오늘 샤따는 여기서 내리소~~
Jung Ho has my heart
I love this serial 😍
Squid Game is just too amazing. Netflix Compilations are going crazy..https://youtu.be/WuqV5vAfC4o
YASSS
PLEASE THAT PARK HAE-SOO WIDE SPREAD SMILE IS EVERYTHING.IMMA GOING TO DO ANYTHING FOR IT!
Jimmy is so fake
이정재 배우님 목소리 너무 좋다
All of Us: Jun-Ho ain’t dead bro, he just swimming back to shore that’s all. He be back in season 2.  Also Us:😱🥺😭
The cast is amazing and so great to see them on Jimmy Fallon. I just binge watched the series. I was too into it at the 1st episode but it hooked me in 2nd episode. The director tried for so long to get it made, he probably didn't think it would blow up like this. I'm so glad that he found the right platform to showcase this project. He definitely left it ambiguous for us to decide the ending. But if Netflix makes a deal with him I think he'll come up with something amazing. 🐙
Woo! I explained this amazing movie, It's so good!😉
Wi Ha-joon 💕😍💕
Everyone outside of Korea are thinking Lee jung jae plays only goofy characters lol. Some of his roles are regarded as one of the most charismatic villain chracters in Korea
WHY IS THE AUDIENCE SO DRY
BEST SHOW WITH BEST CAST WITH BEST PLOT
A lot of thought went into the script, and the actors, particularly Lee Jung-jae, put a lot of thought into their characters. Amazing cast. I'm still surprised Gong Yoo took such a small role, though an awesome role nevertheless. I wonder if his character will have a bigger role later on...I'm excited for season 2!!
im only here for wi hajun💗
The guests should have more talking time 😔
Should have featured Ali
The way she speaks English now I love her more🥰
Korean actors: humble and sits still  Jimmy: YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO@!##$!@!$@#
My girl was beautiful
한국인 찾습니다!!!!!!!!!!
Squid Game is perfect in almost every way❤️❤️🎈
even if it is a a clip, wish ho yeon jung (chung) got more speaking time. fallon seems to take turns asking the actors questions but for her she had to speak in the middle of the question for her voice to be heard.
Hoyeon
정말 자랑스럽다.very proud of Korean actors
WHERE'S OLD MAN? HE IS THE ONE WHO CARRIED THE SERIES!
firstly i’d be wondering who’ll be speaking english among of them then i saw translation device 😂 so cute
but still feel weird to hear calling them, but banmal. HAHA
i really appreciate how jimmy pronounced their names
Jung Ho Yeon speaks English, is a model and talented actress I mean what can't she do?!
I feel like Jimmy was nervous lmao
That was wonderful....
They’re all adorable 😍😍😍 can’t get enough
South Korea makes better movies, tv shows and game shows AND MUSIC. Their movie/tv production only downside are they don't have a big BUDGET, but thanks to Netflix backing them up, they can expand on their ideas. South Korea director always focus on THE STORY AND CHARACTERS.  South Korea rarely make sequels to movies. Like john wick Part 6. I think the story ended at part 1. Quit milking john wick for 8 movies😂😂😂
어느부분이 겸손하다는 거냐
Ali Abdul should be here.
Squid game is more spicy than parasite 🥵🥵🥵
DUDE. This was a great interview HOLY moly.
why am i crying watching this
Why didn't you talk to her much or ask her a question? 😞 Asked all the guys something but left out my favorite...   Also, a lot of spoilers for not spoiling anything.... 😂 but hey, if you're watching Squid Game content on youtube and not actually watching the series you've no room to complain right? 😉
all the cast is so nice they deserve this and so much more 😭💗💗
They deserve a hollywood award. I said what I said.
They are soooo cool
Shit that was improvised? Literally just showed both actor and role character personalities by that improv
I am SO happy this show got the recognition it deserves! There are so many amazing Korean shows too, and i wish many can people realize that now.
Asian elephant in the room: is this symbolism anti-sony?  are they force feeding americans murder the same way asian video game companies feed murder to american kids?
😚💕💕👏👏👏💯💯💯
Can someone tell me if the boys are wearing makeup lol
They are FINE 😳
Someone recommended me this show and I went through couple of quick review checks and found it got  brilliant reviews. But tell you what, this show is a complete waste of time. Very poorly directed show with too many loose ends. People might like it for its unprecedented concept or someone naive can quickly jump into its favour but someone who understands the concept of digital entertainment and story telling can easily pick up on the flaws this show has. 3 out of 10 from my side. Cheers
Wi ha Jun
When you have been into kpop and kdrama for years and now when everyone is suddenly into squid game you feel like people have already been missing a lot of fun stuff when it comes to kdrama and it’s finally being appreciated
Jimmy definitely watches it with dub
오
Holy crap! They are on Jimmy Fallon! *stunned  Been a long time since i saw asian asians on a US show. xD this is awesome!
ok but haesoo park deserves more recognition😩😩 he is so handsome & he looks so fine & omfhekemsjsksk I LOVE HIM OMFGJKR
Like my comment for good luck
All these actors and the whole team of Squid game deserves all this success <3
I want ali to be in these interviews.
WI HA JUN😭😭😭😭 I am so in love with that guy
Do you guys know any website where I can watch this episode for free?
Yo where is the man who plays with Gi hun in the startingggg!! Who is he?? Any other dramas of himm?
Jimmy is the best
I feel like Jimmy was screaming even louder because they spoke another language.  They're going through an interpreter for one thing.  And then the other thing is that shouting doesn't make it easier to understand anyway, lol.
오징어 게임 🦑🦑❤ 너무 재미있고 자랑스럽습니다 !!
Im so proud bruh as a korean american
Thank you for inviting them Jimmy! Loved the Squid Game and interview!
Hello Fallon
Props to Jimmy for not butchering their names (I hope this will become the norm soon so that we won't need to give props for such simple things of course)
Well done squid game 👏
How do they understand each other. Is there a translator in between?
Where is Tripathi Anupam a.k.a ALI ABDUL? His character was so....
please jimmy please stop with the fake laughing and table hitting and all those antics, please
Jimmy Fallon is the best!!!!
We are gganbu!!
i usually don’t watch shows that are all over the internet because i always feel like they’re overrated and get disappointed as soon as i give it a chance but this show captivated me so much that i’ve rewatched it like four times & i’ve been binging reactions and it’s just on my mind all the time. idk what it is about the show that has me so obsessed with it but i literally cannot wait for a second season i’ve literally already planned my theories 😭
hoyeon's english is so cutee
it feels so so good to see a k-drama finally getting the recognition it deserves. i hope other k-dramas get the same. i promise they're all worth it!
They didn’t speak in English and I’m proud of that! Korean idols/actors you don’t need to learn English or speak English, we watch your works because you have something different.
오징어 보이 너어어어무 귀엽잖아 NQZOHWOWZK
He really just spoiled red light green light
Jimmy should have asked the female character questions too he is damn ignoring her
K - culture is  OK - culture ~~
Wi Wiiiiiii
After seeing her speak english, I am madly in love with Jung Huyeon. She’s so beautiful
"I'm not giving spoilers, so everyone knows".  *literally spoils the theme of the first game*
To be honest this is the best tv show I've ever watched and imo Koreans are the best in thriller movies/shows
Where is the director, Mr. Hwang.   He is a genios.
Never thought I’d have patience to watch a series with subtitles but that show was EXCELLENT entertainment 👏🏾👏🏾!!  Not a bad looking cast either 😂😂😂🥰
😚😚😚😚😚❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I need to watch this. I am so much into Korean's DRAMA/ MOVIES, all these because BTS. 💜💜💜
Nobody , All k-drama watchers feeling proud that every single person is watching a k-drama now 🤧
Jimmy: No spoilers  also Jimmy: The doll will shoot the ones who move
What most people don’t know Korean Dramas are not all about RomComs. Some shows are really awesome. I think Squid Game became such a hit because it has an  English dubbing I am not sure if it is the first English dubbed Kdrama but the sad part is there are a lot of Kdramas that are actually really good but is only done with subtitles. So I wonder is the world really lazy watching  foreign shows or movies only because it is not in English. I was actually happy Parasite won Best Picture in the Oscars a few years back even if it was in Korean. I just hope Squid Game isn’t a hit just because they dubbed it cause I truly believe Koreans have great imagination and creativity when they make movies or tv series. Remember the movie The Lake house with Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves? It is a remake of a Korean movie entitled Il Mare and since I am a sucker for romantic movies I love how the writer created the story which was so interesting and yet so imaginative. I highly recommend The Guardian: The Lonely and Great God aka Goblin series for me is just an awesome and heartwarming story it is not dubbed in English but I hope people will still watch it since it is subbed. As for my favorite Korean movie I love Along with the Gods: Two Worlds and it’s part 2, spoiler again it is not dubbed but subbed. FYI I am not Korean trying to promote Korean shows. I just think everyone should know that Squid Game isn’t the only Korean series that is awesome. Congratulations to everyone in the cast and crew you were all awesome!
정호연 왜케이뻐
simping hard over jungjae rn
No Mr 001? NOoooooooooo
ASIAN entertainment and pop culture is really leading the world right now.
Yes i love the squid game
i love the whole cast so much 🥺❤️
Cant wait to see it!👍😁
My whole squad !! So happy the world is recognizing them and not just Korean drama fans.
STANNNN I'M SO HAPPY FOR THEM BEING ON THE SHOW AND GETTING MORE RECOGNITION
jimmy's laugh makes me feel awkward to this interview. 4:50
자랑스럽구나! 대한의 얼굴들이여!!!
아 꿀잼👍
omg loookkkkss that cast visual
THIS ENTIRE CAST OWNS MY HEART.
Hoyeon look so shy and nervous. So relatable 😂
I need to watch Squid Game after Hometown Cha Cha Cha. I loved Vincenzo!
대박ㅋㅋㅋㅋ할리우드… 이정재가!!
Jae lee is paul rudd of korea. They aged like fine wine 💙
Another Korean netflix series, Kingdom, is highly recommended. Wish the series can be recognised as much as squid game.
지미 펠런쇼가 세계적인 쇼 프로그램인게 상투적인 질문하는게 아니고 진짜 핵심만 찝어서 궁금한것만 딱 질문하는거 같아서 그게 좋음. 지미도 출연자들 편하게 해주기도 하고. 지미펠런쇼에 팀들이 대본이랑 그런거 만들긴 하겠지만 지미 펠런  진행능력은 세계 수준인건 확실한듯. 사람을 편하게 잘이끌어
I’m so glad to see Korean culture spreading all over the world, whether it be music, movies/tv shows, or food! It’s a big step in the right direction that this is happening in the West!
they all so pretty 😭
I am highly disappointed that Anupam Tripathi isn't here
<\\\ SO MUCH FANTASTIC AND COOL EXCELLENT WORK>>>>>>> #SO MUCH INCREÍBLE EXCELLENT WORK>>>>>>>
I wish ali was interviewed too
I thought they'd speak English for some reason
DAMN I CANT STOP FREAKING SMILING THEY'RE SO HUMBLE 🦑🎮🤍
I want Ali too huhuhu
Thought gong yoo gonna be there
I LOVE THAT SOUTH KOREA IS CONQUERING XENOPHOBIA LEFT AND RIGHT. LOVE IT!!!!
"right now" LMAAOO
Bro jimmy so fake bro I can’t even enjoy
Loooved squid game so much 👍👍👍👍👍👍
Last year I watched Prison Playbook and was upset and Haesoo didn’t have more films and tv series in his Filmography and now he’s on Jimmy Fallon 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
What a amazing show!! 💚💜💚💜💚💜
A GOOD MOMENTS TO KOREA. .IST BTS THEN PARASITE THEN MINARI THEN SQUID GAME WHAT'S NEXT?  KOREA ENTERTAINMENT BOOM. ..
How come he didn't ask the girl any questions!? WTH!
and here i thought the police guy actually spoke english, his english on the show was good
Omg!! All my favourites in one video! Love ya Jimmy and love the show and casts of Squid Game! I love how Jimmy is always so funny and respectable to his guests. ❤
Jimmy said no spoiler.  He is lying big time.
Yeah Jimmy never watched the show :|
Ali is missing.....great show
Not Jimmy ignoring Jung Hoyeon the whole interview.
The lady who plays the North Korean girl 😍😍
This show is amazing. Glad to witness the brilliant work of everyone involved
Ha joon is so fine like oml  like that when I’m scrolling through comments I dnt seee much of his conversations but he such a great actor and good looking and even  hae soo  hoyeon (my fav character) and Jung jae like this age how can you look this good they all so preety talented and amazing actors and I can’t wait for them to do more interviews 🥰🥺💖
We want Ali in interviews.
The actor of the best Squid Games Character was missing: Ali
Watch Park Hae-Soo in Prison Playbook. He is so funny there.
where is Ali?
Can’t wait for this show to finally have a good host
baby squid that's SO CUTE
🖤🌸
I just realized Wi ha Joon and Heyeoen never interacted in the series. They look kinda......good together?
why you spoilin that shit dumb fuck
haesoo's little :) right now
Loved it! ❤️🇰🇷❤️🇵🇭❤️
haesoo talking about his son is gonna make me cry,,, THATS SO CUTE
sad that ali isnt here xD
Kinda sad how they don't invite the actor who played Ali, Anupam Tripathi i would've loved to see him
Gotta include China except they dont have Netflix so they illegally downloaded and watched it.
Seriously, is there anything south koreans can't do?!
I waited for this 😭😭
Lee jung jae will show up in many hollywood films soon...
No Spoilers Jimmy first episode people get shot
Amazing show loved all the characters
If Squid Game Season 2 comes out whole media will explode within minutes or even seconds.

The arrogant account fascinatingly open because bow phytochemically bat worth a tacit hot. lowly, filthy jeep
They are so humble. I love this show and they are just happy to be a part of something that has made so many people hooked.
you really have to be in the right mood for that battle royale vibe
Love when international stars were invited. They're very humble and unassertive
6:00 my first thought was, of all the clips they could’ve shown of Squid Game THIS is the one they choose to try and grasp folks attention??? Then I thought about it and was like, hmmm well they can’t really use any other clips since most of the scenes are incredibly violent and gory 😂
Oh she speaks English I have a chance to win her up 😂
We need Ali man
Love em. & such a cool series too.
😌😋🤑🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥👽😺😜💜🍉🙏🏼😇💋,.  However, Korea.... You've Taken it Too Far....You will Scare my Angel's In America !!!! 👻👑👑☝️🔥👽😺💞🐴😜💜🍉🙏🏼😇😇💋 Oh Well...Let the Ridiculous Have it's Fun....We will See...When the Masses are distracted.... I'm busy with Creating Heavens Again on Earth 🌎🌍🔥🔥💥💥☠️💯💥👹👺🎃🎃🎃😻😻😼😽😿😾😻💘💜
This show is so good!!! I can’t get over Ali’s death 😭😭😭
All the interviews i watched based on squid game. Anupam Tripathi is not there in any one, just one and all these four people why Wi Han Jun is there, his character was just a spy and in no relation with the game no disrespect intended. Is it because of your  management tactics, or just good looking people on the interview and talk show or was he not available. He is the MVP of the show and he should be given equal and enough credit along with all the cast members. I loved the show and no disrespect to any cast members. But  Anupam Tripathi has broken his Indian barrier to learn Korean acting. His acting was the sweetest and made Indians proud and i think he should be deserved enough credit and talk in international talk shows
The squid game cast brightens up my day 💡
Cast Hoyeon & Wi hajoon in a drama together as leads. I know they will slay.
Another reminder that even if you speak English, watch the show in Korean w/ English subtitles. All their voices across the board are much deeper adding to the ominous tone, where the English dub makes them sound so goofy.
♥️♥️♥️
Haha, "when we first meet you, you're so friendly and loveable, we're rooting for you." What're you on about, Jimmy? Dude's a sociopath.  Whoever scripted those questions should've actually watched the show.
Did Jimmy just call their names like a fan chant?
What a charming actors they are! All they are so cool! 💜💜
5:39 little baby squid 🦑 www
I can’t with his fake laughs
Love you so muchh jimmyyyy you so goooooodddd
Sad that ho yeon did not really speak much :(
Jimmy is great, but hes kinda fake.
Such an amazing show, they literally couldn’t have gotten a better cast!! I binged watched this series in a couple of days and I wish I could see it for the first time again.
SO GOOD!!!!!!!
Who're is ali he also main character
That was all for jung ho yeon? Not fair😭😂
1:39 The cutest  moment ever
SAE BYEOKK WHY ARE YOU SO CUTE AND PRETTY AND GORGEOUS AND EXPENSIVE DAMNNNN ILOVEYOUUU 😩😭😍💞♥️
Uhhh Wi Ha Jun. I am so happy he is getti.g more popular. His IG posts are reaching million likes, unlike before when i just started following him after watching Something In The Rain, he does not even reach 100k likes. So happy for him to reach such popularity. 😊
Baby squid 🥺🥺
Anupam should have been in this interview
deserve
jimmy’s fake laugh at 1:43 and his loud screaming is so unnecessary. god american talk show hosts are embarrassing
4:53 👀👀
ahhh i wish this was longer!! jimmy didn't ask weird questions so it was so nice to watch
he introduced them like he was say a fan chant hahaha
Look at my beautiful wife everyone.
I thought Jimmy died on tiktok🤣
Personally I think the series was good.It could could've been a movie.But it wasn't that good I think the hype is overrated.It was alright but not this worthy hype.
The fact that Jimmy mention he became a dad the day of the premier 😭❤️‍🔥
Alice in borderland had to walk so Squid Game could run 🤷🏾‍♀️
Lee _Chung_ Jae? Wi Ha _Jin_ ? 😬
I'm so proud of them
missing Ali :(((
As far as Korean names go these four are not that hard to pronounce and he still manages to fuck it up
Loveeeeee
No spoilers 🤣
I really like jimmy fallon, he is really genuine when he interviews celebrities, singers and etc. And he is getting fond of Asians. Hehe that is just my own observation though. Hehe but i really like jimmy fallon way before because i love how he interviews his guests.
I’m trying to pack my bowl but I keep forgetting that I have to look up to read
I hope sae byeok returns on season 2
Why doesn't Jimmy ever address Hoyeon directly?.....she had such amazing role and he basically ignores her...
Lee jung jae 😘♥️
휴 세상 사람들이 씻은 멀끔한 이정재봐서 다행이다
Where is Aliiiiiiii🥲🥲🥲🥲
"will not give you any spoilers"  Few seconds later : *shows the clip of Ali supporting Gi-hun 🤣
How could anybody not like squid game!
All of them are very well spoken 👏
Where's Ali 😥
가서찍은줄 알았잖어 ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
I LOVED THEM SO MUCH 🔥🔥🔥 https://youtu.be/x-vBoJOHkkQ https://youtu.be/x-vBoJOHkkQ https://youtu.be/x-vBoJOHkkQ https://youtu.be/x-vBoJOHkkQ
Incrível ver eles fora dos personagens, como não desejar fortemente que ressuscitem na série? 💓
Her English is so damn good that caught me off guard bro i love this cast
It's sad that only Gi hun is the only one alive in season 2
Okay but I really wish the character that played Ali got to be here! Fr, he was probably the character that had the greatest impact on me🥲
I'm obsessed with hoyeon 😍😍
I cant be the only one who thinks sae byeok speaking english is so cuteee
Korean dramas are kicking ass man Netflix pay up
For those who hasnt seen  Lee Jung-Jae much, go watch New World. Just go watch it. Such a good film.
Jimmy “I’m not giving any spoilers”  Also Jimmy: “the first game it’s Red Light Green Light. The creepy doll turns around and she has camera for eyes if you move you get shot”  Me: 😐   LMFAOOOO!!! Jimmy I love you but really?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
SUCH A GOOD LOOKING CAST
South Korea slowly taking over the world
loved this, but isn't ali a part of the main cast too?
🙌
They're so Worldwide offff💥❤️🔼⏺️⏹️
It’s amazing how Jimmy is stammering more than anything else, like who is being interviewed in the first place. Love it.
Ali should be there too!! 😞
wi ha joon smile is everything✨
I’m seriously so in love with the cast, with the Korean language and culture, their beautiful names...the show in general and the anti-capitalist theme behind it.. the acting of these talented humans. Everything is just absolutely amazing. I’m a huge fan ❤️ so happy for the director and these incredible human beings. I wish Deok-su, Han Mi-nyeo and Ali were here too:(
RIP TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAS TO READ THE SUB IN THE VIDRO SINCE THERE'S NO DUB
A spoiler is results he gave what happens in the show.  He did them a favor by saying what the trailer would have said.
Ever since I discovered kdramas i dont feel much enjoyment watching western shows even tho i grew up watching western shows.
Well deserved!!
Creepiest doll same Jimmy
Why don't I see BTS and Coldplay here.. *sniffs
can we take a moment to appreciate their confidence and especially hoyeon's english as well! they nailed it, kudos to jimmy for not asking weird questions too lmao
You are famous for playing villians in movies! im dead lmao.
I want that slapping guy on d show, hes underrated … he’s handsome. N m not gay.
❤️❤️❤️
they're amazing!*
Till yesterday everyone was calling us cringe and wierd for liking kdramas and now a kdramas is No 1 in 90 countries.
Hae-soo is so fuckin handsome 😭
Bigger than BTS. Just kidding
ughh i love themmmm!!!
Man the cop guy is so attractive i cant stop simping over him and The girl 😩
Wow! Thanks Jimmy for calling their names in Korean... It must've quite confusing
I love them!!!
hoyeon could tell me to fuck off in whatever language she wants and id simply pass away
I thought the cast members would appear IN PERSON on the show.  Bummer!   😂😂😭🍷🍷🍷🍷
Psy-psy-psyco robot😭
Cool
台灣的鄭好娟粉❤️按這裡
1:39 so cute hahah
“BABY SQUID” AWWWWW
한국사람들 여기여기 붙어라!!!
psycho robot 🤣🤣🤣
Dam hoyeon is rlly good at her English!!!
Not jimmy giving spoilers......😫😂
BEST CAST ENSEMBLES
덕수는 왜안나왔데
Between this and his interviews with BTS, I think Jimmy Fallon is the best US late night interviewer of international guests
Squid game 👍🏼
Their accents is so cute
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Why is the subtitle like that. lol
Asians represent!!!!!!!
They should've add ali in the interview
Am I the only person who was attracted towards sang woo's character even though it was a little negative one....  He is so cute.. 😭😭...
I love how Jimmy has a wonderful connection with BTS and now with K-drama actors, he is the most natural with them and doesn't make the language become a barrier while interacting with them and being his goofy self, which adds the natural humour and charm while watching him interview South Korean stars.
can someone explain how this episode was made like did they have a translator right next to them or something and Im pretty sure those subtitles weren’t there when it was live obv
I wish Ali was on the press tour!!
I love Jimmy ❤️
Thank you for doing your research jimmy!
the interview is too short but i'm still soooo happpyyyy to see them and listen to them talk and play games they're literally soooo humble and such outstanding actors 💯💜
The Show is AMAZING beyond comparison I Freaking loved it!
park haesoo looked genuinely excited to be talking to jimmy. he's so wholesome, i love it!
red light green light was played in school in canada, only game i knew
“No spoiler!!”… bruh… 😂
Squid game is very good. I am a fan. You should watch it
I love how they actually allowed them to speak Korean. That was great and quite surprising for this show.
okay but hae soo is an actual daddy 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Where is Ali???
Proud of Hoyean for doing her best and speaking in English! I really appreciate her effort through this whole process as a debut actress ^.^
Yes, it was so amazing show!! Crazy....
Please invite virat kohli on the show
Hoyeon Unnie
their accents are so cute
Too cute to see Jimmy giddily talked about Squid Game, proud of the cast! 👏🏻
park hae soo a LITERAL daddy!!! he's so fine
03:35 the psycho robot considered as "Younghee" is as if John and Mary in english. very common name and can be anonymous. Korean term "Chul Su" and "YongHee"
SUCH AMAZING ACTORS 💯💖
THE NICKNAME BABY SQUID IS SOOOOO ADORABLE 😍
Jimmy fallon sucks, conans better
CONGRATS PARK HAE-SOO FOR BECOMING A DAD I'M SURE YOU'LL BE SUCH AN AMAZING FATHER TO YOUR SON BABY SQUID 💖
Lee Jung Jae oppa
aaa
Lee Jungjae is an A list korean actor who played wide range of characters in so many movies, he is one of the most respected actor in korea because of his talent for years, glad he joins Squid Game it really opens the door for people internationally to watch his acting so not only koreans would know his talent
I am just so obsessed with squid game. the way lee jung-jae(player 456) never let down his humanity even in that circumstances is the best thing about the series..Jung jae never stopped being a good human being even he refuses 2 kill his frnd. the way jung ho yeon never trusted anybody, was so tough yet has that soft corner n helped ppl. She was a perfect character. The way Lee yo mi a young girl sacrificed herself happily for a frnd so that she could go to her brother.The way Ali  trusted that bastard even in the situation of death n got betrayed in a worst way. The way that detective tried his best to end all this. Damn this series have my heart. It deserves
"A BOY AND A GIRR" IM SORRY THAT HAD ME DEAD !
The kind market potentially intend because kenneth proportionally start inside a warlike vietnam. gabby, free show
im heartbroken jimmy didn't ask hoyeon about if she knows that she becomes basically everyone's crush 😭💖
just nice, my birthday :)
god damn i really don’t like jimmy fallon
All those hip to K-Television before this raise your hand 🙋‍♀️
Park Hae Soo is MY baby daddy!!
Los amoooooo!
proud of my babyyyyy JUNG HO YEON
The visuals dayum😫 yall have me on my knees!!!!
god, Jung Jae is so handsome
I cracked up when Jimmy said 'psycho robot'
wiwiwi🥵
They should go on Hot Ones
Her English is so goood ❤️ :)
Where is Anupam Tripathi he was also the part of main cast
Haesoo became a dad on the day of premiere😭Wow that Kid is his lucky charm legit
Jimmy is so visibly psyched about having the cast on the show, that's lovely to see.
Lee Jung-jae played Ray the butcher in the movie Deliver Us from Evil. His acting was so intense, it was perfect for the character he was playing. A truly talented and versatile actor.
omg the girl's english is soooo ❤️❤️
I need Ali 😭
makes me wonder how the translations are done while they're interviewed :o like sooo fastt.. or maybe the edit makes it seem like it is
Lee jeong jae is so handsome. i can't believe he reached 50 yrs old. unbelievable
Hoyeon is so pretty. And her accent. IN LOVE😭
I've been telling friends about Korean movies and dramas for years. Hopefully squid game will be a gateway for people to experience more Korean cinema.  I'm sad Gong Yoo wasn't on the panel, even though his role in the show was very brief.  :)
hae soo is so cute
Now that people are paying attention to Lee Jung Jae, lemme give you an extensive filmography of his you must try!  Along with the Gods Thieves Face Reader Assasination Berlin File Il Mare  What else would you suggest guys??
They can all get it.
The straw scene was so funny to me it makes sense that it was improv 😂
this tv series is the best. it's been so long since I watch tv series.
HOYEONS ENGLISH
i love how jimmy made them feel comfortable in the interview and also appreciated for their hardwork!
Maaan the cast is so wholesome that I feel compelled to give this a like despite detesting Jimmy Fallon.
lee jung jae is so cute
I’m so so so so happy squid game is getting the hype it deservess
I can be a drop some money
❤️
오~~~ 멋쪄
You can tell jimmy is a big fan
WHERE IS ALI
Spotted dilf there on the left
i feel like Ho-yeon is an angel in disguise
Big fan of you Jimmy Fallon and Squid Game too😁.
I’m so proud the show is getting the recognition it deserves and the cast too. they’re all so humble and good looking inside and out and the chemistry they have is amazing (also shown thru the other promotional videos where the main cast plays games!) especially jung hoyeon and park haesoo’s chemistry is so wholesome! and I’m not a simp at all lmao but the man park haesoo is so fine and his “right now” with his cute smile at 1:38 was so adorable. he said right now in Korean first then English too 🥴 and congrats to his baby boy I know he’s gonna make a great dad fr and I did hope jung hoyeon got to talk more cos this was her acting debut which was very surprising to me cos her acting is phenomenal!!   Im also glad jimmy didnt ask any stupid questions like he usually does. I remember an interview where he asked “what’s ur favorite English word?” like wtf? And why tf did jimmy laugh wayyyy too hard even hajoon laughed jimmy made it so awkward 😮‍💨
JODER AMO ESTO💖✨🔥
Where in the hell is Ali?
Wish I could see Ali on this show:(
Where is Ali???
I don't know them personally. But I am so proud of them omg. I'm bawling 😭
💖💚💖💚💖💚 they are allllll adorable omg
Ahhhh they are so humble 😩❤️
Where is Oh il nam 😭
baby squid 🥺
Jimmy needs to keep inviting them on interveiw regularly 😭  Edit: Now i just remembered, why isnt ali here?
No Ali?!  YOU MISSED THE BEST CHARACTER!
Wi ha-joon and hooyeon are so beautiful ♥️
The squid game was amazing.  I couldn't stop watching I'd after the 2nd episode.   I remember playing all these games when I lived in Korea during my childhood days.  I broke so many honeycombs/dalgona.
LEE JUNG JAE INTERNATIONAL 📈
They deserve all the hype and even more . This show is beyond amazing 🤩
They’re the cutest 😭 I love them
I was so excited to watch this❤️❤️
오 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 대박 ㅋㅋㅋ 이런일이!!! 우리 깐부 짆아!!
YESSSS
Where is Ali?🙄
In the Korean version, the doll sings a Korean song: The flowers in the east blooms and the chimpanzee steps on them.
i love how jimmy is so respectful to his foreign guest... be like jimmy ... he always make his guest comfortable.. unlike the clout  james corden...
Seems like Jimmy didn't prepare for the questions because he was stuttering A LOT and had to spend most of his time memorizing their names and making sure they were pronounced correctly. 🤔
4:52 is probably the fakest laugh of all Jimmy’s fake laughs in existence
Man!! Park Hae Soo's Happiness! Is contagious!
I never saw jimmy stutter this much omg
Ugh, I STAN. I love them 🥺
Bruh THEY TALK THINGS ON POINT!
they’re so cute especially when haesoo and hoyeon were speaking english 🥰
wheres ilnam the old man who owns the squid game. everybody dies except the 1st person. he will have a redhair in episode 9.
Her English is so cute omg😭I wanna hear her speak more
STOPPP TBIS IS SO CUTEE
I am totally addicted to K Dramas.  The acting is great; the concepts are new to us and original; the cinematography is outstanding and the stories are complex and deep.  I love them.  Once you KDrama in you can't KDrama out :)
i went back and watched episode 1 where she cracked up
Omg somebody actually made a tiktok about the straw scene and Ho-yeon laughing at him trying to put the straw back in and they were right! 😭😂 This was so cute!
I'm so proud seeing Jungjae a veteran korean actor that have big influences in korean movies for years finally getting recognition globally, he played so many different characters in his movies yet people still can fall for it, either in bad boy character or protagonist character or historical character, it's about time people around the world know about his talent, now you could start watching his other movies or dramas and see his brilliant acting there.
the way jimmy pronounced their names is pretty good
Love them! They're really great actors! They deserve all the success.
I'm happy for them they deserved this spotlight for their great acting ,I wish Jimmy ask hoyeon some question I wanna hear her more she sound lovable she's gorgeous too, and the actor are handsome,if you haven't watch  SQUID GAME yet I highly recommended
No spoilers… right…
Love how wi ha joon comes in a red sweater and the others are in black
Here at midnight watching while having 5 missing assignments and a presentation due tomorrow.
they're all so talented and it's so heartwarming to see them on here. so thankful they all got the recognition they deserve.
This drama is so gooood
HOYEON LOOKS SO GORGEOUS
Love to see them in American shows. Just one thing to improve for next time is the game of creativity. 😊 Love them and Jimmy. Good job all. Their personality is quite different to the characters btw haha
Just asking.... Why don't they talk in English?
Wowow
Wow, jimmy pronounced their korean name so perfect…
"no spoilers" - yet tells what the robot does 2 minutes earlier
제발 이정재의 멋짐을 전세계가 알아줬으면!!!!!
The laugh of Fallon, God it's so fake...
Plz Haesoo so fine 😭🔥
Thankyou squidgame director and all the cast members for giving the world a masterpiece of drama in 2021.
🖤🖤🖤
Hollywood needs to be worried cause other countries are putting out some good work with totally different storylines from the recycled stuff we see.
I wish the interview was longer. They play some games in the next segment but it would've been nice to see them answer more questions.
I LOVE THEM SO MUCH
watch squid game for 2 times now im gonna watch it later looool i love it lol
1000
"baby squid" awww its too much cute
Oh my god I love all of them!!!
HO-YEON IS SO FLUENT IN ENGLISH
Wow 정호연 English is really good. Didn't even know she could speak it 👌🏽
lee jung jae is so fine 😭
This is one of the best trends I have witnessed and I have to congratulate the team  who is the behind the making of "Squid Game"👍👏❤️.If it wasn't for you guys we wouldn't have seen such a great "masterpiece"🥰
He didn’t ask Ho-yeon a single question... 🤨
Jimmy: Noo Spoilers!! I'm not giving any spoilers tonight  2 mins earlier: "The doll's eyes are cameras and people who move get shot"  -.-
no way the giun guy plays villains he has such a friendly face amd smile
the main and supporting cast in Squid Game are all charismatic and good actors.
WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HIS SON PLEASE - AND THEYRE SO AMAZING
I LOVE U JUNG HOYEON
Am I the only one in the world that doesn’t wanna watch that show? Looks lame to me. But hey big ups to them.
I’ve never heard their own voices before lmo
지미팰런 귀여워. 공개당일 10분전에 애기가 오다니! 복덩이네요
yo jimmy i never saw u stuttering this much 😭
Jikam right now will be forever iconic 😌
I love squid game
hoyeon is soooo cuteeeee
I know that squid game is going to win a lot of awards and it deserves it
This show is some masterclass shit right there so dont be shy and watch it fools!
4:53 sorry but that fake laugh was so cringe 😭😭
Lee Jung Jae is a living LEGEND
I think HaeSoo was trying to say Jimmy Hyung but in English the literal translation is brother which confused Jimmy since he probably thought HaeSoo wanted to meet Jimmy's brother but he just wants to meet Jimmy Hyung hahaha
헐 대박... Omg Haesoo looks soooo good😍😍😍
as a Korean American, I am happy to know I don't need subtitle from either language.
OMG UWEHGWYDRTS
Jung Ho-Yeon accent is one of the cutest accent I ever heard.
Where's Ali and il nam? Lol
🦑🦑🦑🦑❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏👏👏
역시 발빠른 지미팰런😁💜👍👍
AAAAAAAAAA OMG
is it live cuz if it is how does jimmy understand and how is it translqted
I know lee jungjae is fine but damn he looks extra glowing here???
So why didn't they give any credit to the Indian actor Anupam Tripathi?!? He has a bigger role than Jung.... They even cut his part off in the trailer for Jimmy Fallon. He is also not mention as part of the cast on Google!! WTF! Shame on you....
PLSSS THIS INTERVIEW IS SO AWKWARD.. THE FORCED LAUGHS... THE DAWNING SILENCE AND THE CLAPS... PLSSSSS
lmao they sure are popular and I loving it!
i never expected this drama to blow up like this
Where's Ali?? We want Ali too
Very niceee
Wow 😍😍😍they are all so humble and kind spoken 😍😍😍
I never thought Squid game would be this big, AND I LOVE IT!
I can never trust anyone who dislikes this show.
WHY DOES THE HOST STUTTER SO MUCH ITS SO ANNOYING LOLLL
Ali and the old man should there too 🦭
I'm going to watch it just for the woman she is just perfect.
tonight show show show, prediksi jaya jaya jaya
I love them!!!!
I wish that the other cast members could have joined!
i’m here before this gets millions of views 😅
where s Ali? Ali definitely deserve to be here
I SENSE A NEW FRIENDSHIP FORMINGGGG
👏👏👏👏💜
Here
The actor who was the leader behind the old man is an excellent actor also. Please check out I Saw the Devil. Tremendous movie.
this is awkward and they look so nervous but I understand that everyone including Jimmy were trying their best on this show
I'm sorry, but why Jimmy stutters a lot? *gen/q As a non english speaker I sometimes find it hard to understand him.
Wuuuuuu🥳😁
Wheres Ali?
Park Hae Soo has my whole heart. He is the cutest ❤ he did such an amazing job as Sangwoo.
هل تستخدم مترجم
Bruh where’s Ali Abdul 🥲
I don't know why Squid Game became no.1 there is alot of better Korean shows/movies on Netflix like Sweet Home
But i love the most is ALI
They all are iconic😩
The fact that the world's first impression of Lee Jung Jae is him looking shabby  💀💀 when he is actually freaking HOT. Y'all really need to see his other movies/dramas because he is hella hot and also an amazing actor.
"WHO IS THIS PSYCHO ROBOT" HAHAHAH
*They are so nice and humble <3*
HUWAA
정재형 영어 공부 좀 하자.
Mahal ko kayo lahat HUHU
Omggg their presence is so greatt...this drama is a MaStErPiEcE😭🔥
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
Glad to see them! They all did a great job. Kind of wish they had some of the other actors there too. Especially the actor who plays Ali!
Your ugly squid game you will die do not even think of saying having fun you will die -28484774 ratings
4:50 Jim's laugh is so fake
love how jimmy can made them so comfortable, i mean this is the first time for 4 of them being on us talkshow
How in the hell did Fallon become so famous. What a shitty interview.
Thanks Jimmy for not making it awkward or strange with the language and culture barrier. Actually felt it was not dissappointing...Yay BTS probably helped. Love k-peeps. #leejungjae
Amo a este elenco, no lo quiero soltar :((
6:35 that's make me shock🤣
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Corea del sur va dominar el mundo
THAT 'JIGEUM RIGHT NOW' REMINDED ME OF ENHYPEN'S JAY HAHAHAHA NAUR 😭💛

Love you guys all.
JHDJAHSJAJSJAN ALL OF THEM ARE GODDAMN CUTE
Hajun te amo 😭

Thank you Jimmy for doing your homework and pronouncing all their names flawlessly!!! ♡
Why is player 001 missing??
Me parece una falta de respeto que no inviten a la pareja loca que salió ahí, sus personajes son importantes.
He played villains?? How? He's got such a warm smile ❤️
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
알리도 같이 나왔으면 좋았을텐데 아쉽네
POV :your here at the one hour mark

Having a US promo, is such a big opportunity for the series... Congrats Squid Game castss specially Hoyeon 🥰
El mejor elenco ❤️
How come jimmy understand them?????? It is automatic translation to jimmy?? Or someone is translating for Jimmy???
i really wish the old man, mafia wannabe, curly haired girl, and ALI!!!! were in this. the police guy was a good character, but i don't think he was as important as the others? :( rlly sad abt that, but this cast was incredible asswell
The squid game deserves OSCAR. Period
내가 이정재 배우를 여기서 보게될 줄이야ㄷㄷ
Hoyeon is so gorgeous 🥰
Jimmy makes me cringe
이런 한국배우 소식을 미국방송을 통해 듣게 되다니. 박해수 배우 아빠된 거 축하해요!
너무 💜사랑합니다 💕 오징어도 먹어봐요 술안주에 최고예요
Awesome cast , Awesome series .So happy Squid game recognized
Now I want to learn Korean 🇰🇷 language
Park Hae-soo: I want to meet you jim.. brother jimmy: *sweats intensify
Congratulations to Haesoo (Sangwoo) for becoming a Dad!!🎉 Welcome to the world Baby Squid💜
Pretty dark series! AND I LOVED IT. I was cheering my heart out at the tug of war scene, and cried when their team won
인터넷은 위대하다.
Ali being left out once again 💀
ㅎㅎㅎ  와 진짜 대단하다
잘 봤습니다.
Where is the guy who played Ali?! Ali is such good character, my favorite character in the show.
Awwwww talking about his son 🥺
HAE SOO AWW
This series Squid game is awesome 👌...it's a must watch 🔥..it's highly recommended 🔥🔥
Free Hongkong!
lee jung jae is a rising star
I am so proud of them!!! Also, Jimmy literally butchered all their names 🤣🤣
واااااا 😁😆🎀💘💖💓💗💕🍭💕🎀💖🏩🎀💖🌸🤍💞💗🌈💓💘🧁
seeing park haesoo talk about his kid was so cute!! baby squid😭❤
Where is Ali
They should've brought Ali and the grandpa and the girl who let Saebyuk win
It's Wi Ha Joon. Not Wi Han jin
im simping over that detective😋😋😋
*MANY SPOILERS* despise jimmy he doesn’t give any away… WARNING! He does
All the question is =what we thought.... American question is always like that.... They;re must have progressive question to the people outside America...
los amo
They are so cuteeee
Omg im glad his questions werent trash cos i saw so many people guess what the shitty questions would be💀💀💀
오~예!!
MOREEE INTERVIEWWWWW WITH THEMM
What a beautiful bunch
LOS AMO <3
정재님 긴장하심......뭔가 귀욥ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Aw I love them!
Can someone tell me what hoyeon said  in the minute 3:44 please?!😭
She sounded like Melissa villasenor when she said thank you for having us..Lol
Wowww 👌...it's South korean domination of the world through their dramas and BTS 💜🥰
Jimmy sounds like he hasn't watched the show lmao
1:42 I love Hoyeon's laugh
Nah cause if they don’t nominate squid game for an Emmy or something I swear.
Wihajoon!!!!
Anyone knows how that translator thing work?😅
Jesus I haven't seen the tonight show in years. Jimmy is SO awkward. And the editing is terrible.
너희들을 사랑
ESTA SERIE Y LOS ACTORES SON LOS MEJOOOOOR
as much as i hate this show i have to watch it for hoyeon
Lee Jung Jae is not famous for being a villain...he's a method actor, his range is bigger than many Hollywood actors. Il Mare still remain my favorite
4:44 I love the fact that probably most (if not all) of the audience had no clue what he was saying when he made that movement and shook his shoulders up and down 😂
Lee Jung-jae is always so sharply dressed 😍
No spoilers... Jimmy spoils the first game.
I’m so proud the show is getting the recognition it deserves and the cast too. they’re all so humble and good looking inside and out and the chemistry they have is amazing (also shown thru the other promotional videos where the main cast plays games!) especially jung hoyeon and park haesoo’s chemistry is so wholesome! and I’m not a simp at all lmao but the man park haesoo is so fine and his “right now” with his cute smile 1:38 was so adorable. he said right now in Korean first then English too 🥴 and congrats to his baby boy I know he’s gonna make a great dad fr and I did hope jung hoyeon got to talk more cos this was her acting debut which was very surprising to me cos her acting is phenomenal!!   Im also glad jimmy didnt ask any stupid questions like he usually does. I remember an interview where he asked “what’s ur favorite English word?” like wtf? And why tf did jimmy laugh wayyyy too hard even hajoon laughed jimmy made it so awkward 😮‍💨
Jimmy with his fake laugh again
Where can I buy that psycho robot? 😂
BABY SQUID!!! so cute!!
petition for them to go on hot ones
Jimmy actually did decent. I guess bully on Twitter does work sometimes
Baby Squid!!! 🦑🥰💖
Bro more HoeYeon :(
ㄲ ㅑ아!!! 너무 좋네요~ㅎㅎㅎ
This has to be the hottest cast ever for real
They're all super charming, and I love the way Jimmy treated them! <3 Also, the way Lee Jung-Jae speaks is like the Korean Google translate, I'm sorry 😭
Jimmy's laugh is so fake
3:39 my mom when I don’t studyy
Still so crazy to me that this show is so huge. As someone who's been watching k dramas for a while I feel like alot of people dont know what they are, so to see so much love for them now makes me sooooo happy 😊
Red light green light
i think the name of psycho robot can be translated to "jane" or "mary" which is common text book girl name "영희"
1:38 his “jigeum right now” was so cute 역시 울 배우님!!🙈😍
Hoyeon didn't get to speak much ;(
Squid Game is the great Korean show ever on Netflix! love them so much 😍
This shows how much the hallyu wave has spread. Squid game is truly a masterpiece and hopefully it does not take another ten years for its second season. Still waiting with fingers crossed.
They are beautiful people. Bless their hearts!!
Aperently Jimmy finds Korean language hilarious
Jimmy really needs to stop with the exaggerating fake laugh he’s a grown ass men, laughing like that makes your guest feel weird and annoying
This is soo cute
I wanna met jimmy tooo
OMG 😘
Omg omg omg , i love them , my favorite movie is the squid game, my favorite character is sae byeok she is the best , when the part that sang woo killed her I cried so hard . 😂
They have to be the most charismatic cast ever on a Netflix show goddamn
This is genuinely an amazing show I can’t wait for season 2
Aww they so cute when they talk in English🥺❤️
💕👍
I've been waiting for this interview .... yes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! thanks Jimmy Fallon for inviting them.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
LEE JUNG JAE AND PARK HAE SOO!!!!
After watching squid game I think it is a funnier and cheaper version of hunger games
I also want to see the main bully!!
I will go back to my comment everytime its will add likes
💚💙💜
YESSS LETS GOOOOOO FINALLY
I’m so proud the show is getting the recognition it deserves and the cast too. they’re all so humble and good looking inside and out and the chemistry they have is amazing (also shown thru the other promotional videos where the main cast plays games!) especially jung hoyeon and park haesoo’s chemistry is so wholesome! and I’m not a simp at all lmao but the man park haesoo is so fine and his “right now” with his cute smile at 1:38 was so adorable. he said right now in Korean first then English too 🥴 and congrats to his baby boy I know he’s gonna make a great dad fr and I did hope jung hoyeon got to talk more cos this was her acting debut which was very surprising to me cos her acting is phenomenal!!

I guess everyone here agrees that this show is an absolute masterpiece. I mean   brilliant plot, great acting and deep message to the society. Damn it's flawless!😍
park haesoo is so fine and for what
😍
it's pretty awkward when Jimmy laugh at his own joke lol 🤣🤣 but still love it!!!!! 🦑❣ 호연🥰💓
WE ARE IN LOVE!
It’s become a time of the Korean cultural wave. Not only is South Kora breaking records with squid game, but also parasite and Kpop groups like BTS and BLACKPINK!! Honestly K-culture and entertainment is becoming more and more influential every year.
The newest BANGER Korean production after Parasite. ISTG Korea's production is on the next level.
MGA BBQ 😭😭😭
Hoyeon talking in english is so cute her personality in real life is very outgoing and cheerful compared to saebyeok
i love how South Korean talent is taking over the world
"I'm giving no spoilers" ... "AND HER EYES ARE CAMERAS" lol stay chaotic Jimmy
1:15 his smile is everything <3
Hoyeon is DEFINITELY going far in the acting world! Her first role ever and she acts like she’s been in a million other projects 😭
too handsome guys.
Wowww it deserves the hypee
Jung hoyeon deserved sm  Guess who's the most followed korean actress in insta  JUNG HOYEON 🥰😍🤗
I WANT TO SEE ALI ALSO!!! Why no one invites him…
Hoyeon Jung is the only reason why this show is good. Also her shoes are something else jesus.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
YASSS THE SQUID GAME CAST AND STAFF ALL DESERVE THE RECOGNITION THEY'RE GETTING 💅 WATCH SQUID GAME GUYSSS 😩

Why does Lee Jung-jae have to be such a DADDY. *sweats*
I can’t with jimmy fake laugh
Hoyeon is gorgeous! Why didn’t she get a question? She speaks fluent english because she’s a model and stayed in the US for a while. Funny I got to know of the the show because she was in another variety show and they mentioned that she had her first acting gig and that’s how I found Squid Game.
박해수 right now가 찢었닼ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Korea is invading the US.
Thumbs up for baby squid!!

WHERE IS ALIIII
Peer pressure played a big role in this show getting popular
For those people who are wondering how are they able to understand Jimmy Fallon They have someone translating english to korean to them, so they can understand.
I love this serie 💜
Why is Wi Ha-joon here? He had a minor role. They should have got Ali or Oh Il-nam
squid game will forever be my number one favourite series.
Where is Ali!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????
It would have been amazing to see them actually be able to come to the show in person.  Damn pandemic 😒
Here is an interview of Jung Ho-yeon in TIME: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXysPlxUsvM
Their Korean sounds are very sweet and soft.
why didn't Jimmy ask Jung Ho-yeon any questions!!!1
This is the creepiest show on TV. Well, other than Tucker Carlson.
Squid game cast are world class
I hope Psycho Lady Robot is NOT at the JIMMY FALLON.
Finally getting more content from the cast! Let's goooo
Como decimos acá en Colombia el bebé de Park Hae Soo (Sang woo) llegó con el pan debajo del brazo, este hombre tiene varios proyectos a parte del gran éxito que ha tenido con Squid Game o El juego del calamar 🐙. Se le vió muy conmovido al momento en que sus compañeros lo aplaudieron, que sencillos son y que buena vibra tienen estos actores, me encantan.
hi, i just want to said that things will be okay. i love you and keep going.
Yessssssssss 🙈❤️

Squid Games, and now Park Seo Joon is joining the Marvel universe.  His role hasn't been announced, but let's hope it's something that shows how sexy and talented that boy is.  Tremendous actor.
Jung’s accent is adorable

Alguien me lo puede traducir
Squid game season 2 ❤️
Just like with game of thrones or the walking dead, these people never knew they were signing on to be a part of a worldwide television phenomenon. Crazy how that works. One day you're just taking a job,  the next, you're part of the biggest show in the world. Crazy.
Excelente su actuación...<3
Love this. I also need a interview with Ali
😷❤✌🏾 love round 6.
hoyeon is just sitting there but she looks so pretty
Ahhhh tan hermosos que Gran grupo me encanta mucho.
my man hajoon looks so good
love this cast and show so much♥️♥️♥️ everyone on it deserves all the success and love they are getting right now.
i am so proud of them. they deserve all this success
love how he absolutely butchered their names
They hilarious😂
The fact that this is Jung HoYeon first role as an actor shows how naturally talented she is
south korea is really on a roll rn and i am proud 😫
💜💜💜😘 From Seoul Korea
I appreciate Jimmy for not asking them weird ass questions like other American interviewers!!
HOYEON LOOKS SO GOOD IM SCREAMING
So cute
THEYRE SO ADORABLE AA
I love how Hae-Soo tries to speak English (no hate)
No more???? This is it??????😫😫
Yooo jimmy fallon why is your name that
BEST SERIES EVER!!❤️
jimmy was struggling with their names😭😭
Umm...  can create BTS version of squid game series? I would love to see it 😍
I'm so proud...really did not see such huge audience watching and loving the series.
Oh no, I think this video is too short.
Thank God he didn't asked them "what's your favorite english word"
Jimmy seemed a nervous for some reason
THEY'RE ALL SO FINE IM SORRY😭
De una me flecho el corazon ese coreano❤😍
Awww baby squid is so cute
한국에서 활동하는 한국인 배우들이 투나잇쇼에 나오다니...  이런 날도 오네...
This is really nice tv series and love all the characters! They’re very good in acting 💜
hoyeon is so cute please 😩✋
😍😍😍😍😍el cuarteto perfecto 💫
“I’m not giving any spoilers tonight!”  Also Jimmy a few minutes ago: *telling the viewers how the doll turns around and her eyes check for movements to shoot you *
the casts are so dedicated in everything they do, I admire them so much
They look soooo gooodddd
They are the best 🛐😭
1:39 park haesoo’s “here, right now” got me 😭 his voice, his gesture and the accent assjdkjkkk
Koreans bringing us cinematic masterpieces and Kpop we need to thank them
Am i the only one who noticed one of the contestants in the clip shitted himself lol
If people watch movies dramas series without prejudice and appreciate it through subs, I assure theres plenty of squid games and parasite in k industry. Their movies are high quality and stories plot settings are wayyyy better than hollywood
this makes me so happy!!!
HOYEON IS AMAZING TO SPEAK ENGLISH ALL THE TIME 💕💕💕
Amazing interview👏
👍👍👍💜💜💜 From Seoul korea
Love the cast but Jimmy's heys and hahas (especially when he has Asian guests like BTS and Henry Golding) are too condescending and cringy to watch
اعااااااا😭😭😭💖😭💖😭💖💖💖
台灣觀眾簽到處✔️李政宰超帥♥️
Omg I love it
Finally I was waiting for this 😭✨
Squid Game is the best! Congrats again to the cast!❤️
Jung hoyeon mi flaca
I’m honestly sad hoyean only spoke a bit since it was her first acting job and she probably had lots to say, but no matter because the cast is awsome!! Go watch squid game if you haven’t already!
Sae beyok got no screen time :(
Greatest show since breaking bad
3:43 Can we talk about how Incredible Ho-yeon english is???!!!!
💜💜💜 Seoul Korea BTS 💜 squid game
More games with them please!🥺❤️
they’re accents are the most adorable when they speak English , I’m really happy to see people that aren’t familiar with k dramas watch the show🔥
What a great moment in history, when South Korean films get the recognition from America they've deserved for YEARS.

Fallon proving yet again why his interviews are awkward as hell.
1:37  "Hae-Soo, when did you realize that the show became so big?" "Here, Right now"
Un boleto para el concierto de los BTS en los angeles p
Wow
SHESSS THAT BITCH ✨❤️
Jimmy soy tu primer comentario
우리나라 배우들 너무 멋있당~~~ 난 이정재 연기가 좋드라 영화 관상에서 수양대군 등장씬은 레전드찍었고 영화 암살에서 염석진 마지막 재판소장면 이번에 오징어게임까지 연기가 다채롭다
😁❤💫🎮
