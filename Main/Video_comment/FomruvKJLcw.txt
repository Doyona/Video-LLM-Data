Paul pogbas goal bruno fernandes could never do that
Do miss Pogba’s magic
Pogba with the goal of the season.
siu
Who’s here reminiscing
this. united. was. class.
Some goal ah
*Pogba* Preffered foot: Both
What a Outstanding goal from Pogba 😎😎😎
EMBARASSING V ONE OF THE WORST SIDES IN PREM LEAGUE HISTORY. A MASTER OF FAILURE AND semi finals. GARBAGE.
If you wanna beat us don’t score first
Pogba has more goals this season than Havertz...wow.
HOW??? HOW the eff is HARRY MAGUIRE Manchester Uniteds' captain???  He's shite!!!
I made an original song called get up and spread the love. It took ages to make and I would love it if some of you could watch it.
Anyone who says united scraped this win, your wrong areola kept Fulham in this game could off easily been 4-1 united
This is a league winner's win
Fernandez is a top drawer player, thing is he's a snide dirty bastard as well, and at some point in the near future that will catch up with him. The Nev will cryarse when this happens, I'll have no sympathy, been getting away with it for too long.
Love that Cavani celebration. All heart and passion! Utd badly needed that for a long time.
bro its like if the opposition dont score we dont play
Manchester united new players morale is up they drew with liverpool they playin really good myt hac a shot at title this season
Man u have actually gon good i cant lie
"We’re going to win the League!! We’re going to win the league!! Ole Gunnar believe us!! Pep you better believe us!! Klopp you better believe us!!! We’re gonna win the league!!" - 442oons <3
Pogba is playing well but how long will he play like this for?
How lazy is Pogba though, sprint back and challenge that, don't jog and give up. Literally to blame for Fulham having an easy shot on goal.
For the 1st goal Fred was crazy hungry to retrieve that ball back after he saw Fernandes' lethal shot hit the post then his one two with fernandes then his lethal low cross was perfect for Cavini's instincts to kick in. United is back!
No crowd, no home advantage.
Great goal by pog but the keeper could have done a bit better I reckon
With cavani's arrival pogba has been playing better.
Such a good hit. Not weak foot there!
Well done Man U you just about beat a relegation battle team 🤣🤣🤣
Shocking defending on the first goal
This time last week. Is Ole' the right man for the job. Jobs too big for him. Need more experience. Has he had his last prawn sandwich at Old Trafford ? Nowt as fickle as media.
Bruno at 1:32 is every United fan
He's got big areolas.       areolas got big hands I meant
All I have to say is Pass the ball Rashford
Didn’t even know this was on tbh  Covid has turned me into a zombie
You see the two sides of Pogba here. Half-heartedly putting up his hand for an offside for the Fulham goal, and not bothering to chase back to try and stop the chance, followed by a great goal.  If he actually tried throughout games then he'd be the best in the world.
Shaw was dodgy once again especially late on williams and telles are better
Lookman was well offside!
Pogba is class y didn’t he used to start
Im a liverpool fan but i think united are the best in the prem rn
Graeme souness  eat your heart out
Utd will defentently finish top 6 again this yr
me: reads the title     also me realizing that Pogba's probably leaving:   *sad music intensifies*
Fernandes is the best thing that has happened to UTD the last 7 years.
Where's Pogba been hiding for most of the last 6 years?
2:07 Nobody gonna talk about how good that Fernandes cross was?
Cavani complaining about ball not coming in the box. He is right. AWB crosses are poor, Greenwood and Martial don't cross the ball in the box, like they afraid or something!
Come on United!
Maguire is awful at heading at goal from corners, so many free headers since he’s been at UTD and he barely ever makes the keeper work.
cavani is an OG👌
0:49 This is for the Fred haters.. this is what he does.. we had no right to continue an attack here but he never gave up.
Can’t match Cavani’s Gladiator-like passion these days.
When you have to score a finesse shot with a french midfielder in fifa
Amazing how I thought cavani would be falcao 2.0..... he’s proved everyone wrong... he’s still class
I keep thinking we are going to here aguaroooo shouted in the last game of the season daunting
M United  Really Deserve the premier league 👏 🙌 💙
Here after Liverpool 0-1 Burnley 😁 City and United title race rn 😉
If you score first against united at home don’t celebrate.
Ddg should've come out a bit further for the Fulham goal ,might've saved it
We are back for real this time
City has a game in hand over United. And a win with that puts us over the red bandits.
If rashford would've passed to Cavani on the Liverpool game United would've won it
Can’t wait for their luck to run out
Maguire and Cavani need to go practise headers
I like martial but cavani has done enough to be our first choice striker
United won’t stay there🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Manchester United had poor defense like in the Leipzig game
It should of been 3-0
Hi
That Pogba goal gets better with every viewing. What a strike.
Can we all agree Cavani has to start ahead of Martial??
Am not a united but i am lways happy when pogba plays well
Wher is crowd? I can hear noise of peeple but no one ther.
Good to see Pogba up his game as Fernandes tires out!  Rest him and give VDB and Mata a run
Fred's penalty??? Stonewall
areola is easily top 3 prem gks atm
I'm mad at Fulham man they had 3 great chances to actually scored it should of technically  end 3-2 Fulham RLC 2 goals
Does this mean Man U are going to win the league ‘ or until they lose another game ‘ also  pogba  will sign for the rest of he’s career 😂
Pogba on top form lately
Man Utd are Doing well once again I think 🤔 maybe They Could win the League 👍
POGBAAAAAA
Just watched that goal again. Really amazing goal from that position
Can't wait for city to slap it's 5
Wan bissaka is  brilliant at defending 1 on 1ns & tackling but positioning and all other aspects of being a defender he lacks so bad. It looks as if he has a very lazy attitude like he doesn't care. Wouldn't be surprised if he gets replaced in a few years if he doesn't fix his attitude.
wont be for long they will finish about sixth just not good enough
Man Utd,social distance  LoL hmmmm
cavani's looking well, pogba fkn useless, bruno the man as usual
My midfielder🔴
Pogba having his traditionally amazing few weeks to try and get a transfer again.
Ole’s at the wheel
POGBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA G.Y.S.O.T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DECENT GOAL BUT HIS FAULT FOR FULHAM'S OPENER HE JUST LET LOOKMAN RUN BY HIM, ONE GOAL DOES NOT MAKE HIM THE GREAT PLAYER HE IS HYPED TO BE.
Who would’ve known how important an in form pogba would be
De Gea Sucks!   Wan-Bissaka & Lindelof Are Not Good Enough!   Fred Is Overated!   Fernandes Is Beginning To Be Out Shinned By Pogba!   Martial Is A No Show & Greenwood Looks Lost!
Just shows how Penandes can’t actually score that many goals if it wasn’t for all the ones Man U always get!
Maguire, The human Beko Fridge... Free header and almost puts it out for a throw in. He needs to work on that.
I don't see many Liverpool fans on the videos where they lose or on Man Utd wins. Wonder why? Couldn't be because they're plastics?
I didn't know Maguire was so terrible in the air, makes sense tbh!
Anyone else find it weird how Neville said pogba will be the best and carager said stones and there both playing class
who else thought Pogba was going to rabona it
The pogba goal was alright at best
Cavani reminds me a lot of van nistelroy
As a Liverpool fan I got to be honest that Cavani has been a great signing
I 'm happy United won from being a. Goal down and Cavani equalised. And Pogbas goal was a. Scorcher united are still Top of the. League Martial was poor, And Cavani could have had another. Goal it was good save from the Fulham goalkeeper Getting the Three points. Which is lmportant thing, ⚽😄
Great goal pogba but why mss that sitter against Liverpool
Look at Pogba actually trying now to secure the move away at the end of the season haha
Come on UTD
United should buy lookma,,just my opinion
Pogba goal is goal of month
Areola pull off some amazing saves.
Great goal by Pogba but he was at fault for their goal in the first place.
I've never seen a player cost so much, be so inconsistent over 5 years and still gets called world class by United fans. It's clear to see Bruno is the one that has changed their team around.
Premier league goalkeepers & they still push shots back into the danger zone like Sunday league amateurs
Cavanni’s passion is beautiful! He has to start the big games!
Lookman's goal was just a Fifa goal, no defending.
Cavani  is a proper  Italian  player  always rolling around o the floor full on diver utd with all these cheats  might get lucky and win the league  just hope city win it
don't play like this against arsenal or they will embarrass you
Wow no penalty for united this game Jesus this must be a miracle
*Takes lead against United*  United: So you have chosen death
And the cheats go marching  on  ffs
Opposition: Scores first United: So you’ve chosen Death
Cavani is highly underrated actually playing good
pogba is backk
Is pogba back?
Cavani is manu's best striker at moment.
Loftus-cheek 🤦🏾‍♂️
Man united have a good chance
Team scores against united in the first 10: Also that same team: “I’m in danger”
united are going to win the league, no doubt about it
Pogba is the reason Fulham scored... But for the goal, he wasn't actually that effective.
Cavani needs to FU***** START
Cavani needs to start in the big games he’s a real danger and very under rated
If Pogba can somehow help United to the title all his past bullshit will be forgiven instantly.
Loftus cheek was so good today
I love how Paul Pogba is conducting United's play.
why's no one talking about Fred... that first goal was all him!
Pogba is showing up KDB this season 😳
Bruno has got some ping on him
Fred's stone wall penalty was worthy of a few seconds in this edit
They just win and loose
Is it just me or can pogba only score bangers and never just a normal goal
Cavani Brilliant yesterday !!!
Why is pogba popping off all of a sudden
No disrespect to Martial but Cavani is a proper number 9.
proud of pogba, he seems focused right now
Pogba is wayyyy to underrated. Give him some slack the last couple of games this guy has been world class. Honestly if he leaves United I’d be vexed. He is good for squad morale and attacking. Everyone who says he’s ded look in a mirror and he dissapointed
Pogboom🔥🔥
How Martial gets picked is beyond belief.
Pogbeast
Man Utd fan speaking. I must say Fulham played really good and gave Man Utd a hard time. Such a shame they were very unlucky. Hope they win in their next match and not get relegated.
It was a great goal by Pogba but let's just appreciate the ball control as it fell out of the sky before he scored 👌
maguire misses so many of those headers, what's the point in picking him out if he can't direct them?
You have all been written off by the media and pundits and yet you won't give up and you all keep on fighting. A special mention for David de Gea, Luke Shaw and Paul Pogba. You are beginning to prove everyone wrong. The haters will always hate but believe me, we believe in you and appreciate how hard you are all trying to turn this club around. You are bringing joy to millions around the world. Thank you , we love you. GGMU.
Keep on going ole and the reds go marching on on on. Glory glory man United.
you gotta say, its nice to see Pogba playing with a smile, he really is a world class player when he wants to be.
Maguire needs to stop missing thoughs headers gonna cost us a match at some point
Fantastic finish from Pogba
Man U need better defenders
Pogba played like crap tho
How Fred wins it back for Cavanis goal. So underrated
This was expected but pogba goal is one of the season contender magnificent.
Pogba is improving so much and has been playing rlly well recently
How lazy was Pogba coming back on that first goal. Disgraceful.
Pogba used to not play like what
Hate man u with a passion
No Fulham praise we managed to do something Liverpool couldn’t and a mistake gave them the first goal 🤷‍♂️
As a fulham fan I AM SCARED TO DEATH THAT WE WONT GET ANY WINS
That maguire effort is ridiculous. How can he be that unaware of where the gaol is
They r good against bad teams, can't even beat a non fit liverpool squad yet are at the top of the table🙄
Pogba scored an absolute belter Roy: dats his job
This is one the comment sections where I actually agree with Uncle Ruckus.
Frogba for life 🐸
Opinions that should be facts:  Ole>Lampard
Lol my mate stopped supporting united at the end of the season because they were doing bad now he supports them again lol
Cavani is so damn good. Should have signed him years ago.
Concede when you don't park th bus.
Cavani is the striker that Martial will never be
Pogbas goal reminded me of Therrie Henry a number of years back.  Can't remember who it was against.
Pogba is actually playing good this season props to him
As a leeds fan iv never wanted man u to win until tonight. Keep fulham down there
Everyone praising Pogba for his goal. That was nothing but luck though. My real question is where was he for United's first goal? A midfielder is expected to drop into the back when a defender pushes up, which Maguire is great at doing. That's why mctominay is a better player.
What as donny van beek got to do get in that team week after week sat in the stands and that Fred playing regular bloody useless wants to go back and join flintstones
Cavani HAS to start. Drop Martial. Fred has been excellent!
A MESSAGE TO FULHAM GET POGBOOMED🥵🥵🥵😈😈😈🥶🥶🥶🔥🔥🔥🥴🥴🥴🐐🐐🐐
Am I seeing right? Did man United actually win without the influence of the referee? 😱
pogba on less games has more goals then arsenal entire defence lol
Pogba really showing up lately, well in!
Fulham should have equalised several times, united can’t keep on winning luckily
I’m a Man U fan but Areola is a decent gk
Paul Pogba should have done better and trail the Fulham player and stop the goal when he noticed the other centre half was not there. He should have taken on the duties himself. Just like Roy Keane/ nick butt did in the past. Apart from that, he makes back to score the winning goal.
Cavani is looking sick
Cant help but feel DE gea could of shut that angle down more for the 1st he was more or less still on his line
Cavani and pogos different breed
I saw Man City game and I thought they were top of the league then United won
That touch from Pogba 👌
Cavani and Bruno different breed
Man the table is really topsy turne
Fulham should’ve won. Period.
Fulham were robbed...
Decent goal but "stunner"...? Nah
Pogba Scored United the winner again. come on United!!
Come on basingstoke
Man city will win the leuge
dont put up th fkin score Sky............ Cant some watch it with out the result..................
Nice to see cavani back after the English FA decided they have the right to police the world on their language. Be a decent gesture if they hadn’t been kneeling for a year to a Marxist organisation
A lot of finger tip saves from Areola... 😉
City will win the title.
Left foot shot by Bruno,  Second ball won, left foot cross by Bruno Left foot finish by Cavani. And to top it, a beauty left footed finish from Pogba. Nice to see the two footedness of the team as they are all natural right footed players.
from every angle lookmans goal looked offside
Paul pogba is on fire
Oh a about time san
What happened United's defence for the Fulham goal? Headline might be "Pogba makes up for leaving his marker in for a goal by scoring"
Fulham actually done well. Shame Loftus cheek didn't score that  chance when he booted an open goal
Why doesn't anyone criticise maguire Easy chances missed.. Again. Basic defender
They are deffo playing for Ollie
I new no matter what cavanis age he was gona be a big signing for utd
Nice goal
We need to put teams to bed I can’t be having a damn near heart attack every game man😂😂
The few times united give pogba a chance he does that.
BOTTLE JOB UTD!!! 🍾🍾🍾
1:42 The touch was decent too
Pog-back.
A fairly flat performance but another 3 points in the bag. Greenwood is looking more like Lingard this season - just passes back, never runs in behind, never takes on his man. And do t get me started on Martial! So poor.
I support liverpool rip
Pogba is unbelievable when he wants to be
why is it always pogba winning the game for united
That lookman looks a decent player and what a goal by pogba
Personally, I think taking that gamble on Cavani was a stroke of genius 🤔
Martial needs to step up, he's been woeful and we re halfway through the season already
Pathetic fulham. Cant wait to see the end of them already. Terrible to watch
When United gets defeated its because of Pogba, when they win its all Cavani, bruno fernandes and who else.. Funny premier league pundits
Harry Maguire needs to practise heading .
Pogba 🧨⚽️❤️
Souness will be raging
Gotta admit bruno has been amazing all season and this has to be the best version of utd pogba we've seen
Remember when Chelsea fans were wanking over Werner and laughing at Utd signing Cavani? Hahahahahaha. Where are you guys?
Pogba has been very key in our big wins these past few games, scoring the winner on multiple occasions. (Also winning penalties)  But I'm sure his haters won't see all that...
We need rid of martial. Another awful game for him.
PogBOOM!
Great to see Cavani knocking them in like a proper number 9! It's what we've needed for ages!
Look at the way Pogba runs back to defend the Fulham goal! 😂 Absolute poser and a dreadful footballer
Cmon boys
?
A Man U fan on Twitter said Pogba is the best midfielder in the world because he scored against fulham
cavani is underrated maguire needs to be scoreing those simple headers and wan bissaka is turning into a flop
Pogba’s goal ⚽️  “Touch, stepover and power just pure 🔥 🔥
Man United top of England and AC Milan top of Seria A world order restored i feel like I time travelled.
It’s amazing how Cavani took a year out from football and he’s still one of the best strikers in the world, 33 and shows no signs of slowing down.
Pogba or drogba
Poor game from Martial
Pogba is world class I believe if we win the league he will sign a new deal COME ON UTD liverpools stupid era is over
Almost like ole started playing his best players 🤔
Just your daily reminder that cavani is younger than Jamie vardy.
Anguissa is class
POGBOOM!!! ⚽️
Martial really needs to start scoring again... as for Luke Shaw... top class.. ive always  been a fan!
Maguire's positioning for the opener is shocking. Too many times this season
Fulham
Oh no ffs
jammy
Its taken 4 years... But pogba is finally coming good for United
Meanwhile other headlines will read "Parker disappointed by defeat but proud of the team" who cares lol
Lookmans a baller tbf
Pogboooom ☄️
Areola is quality
POGBAAAAAAAAAAA DAB
Good to see Pogba having fun again what a player hope he stays consistent
Cavani is such a good player. World class. No other player on the planet can score simple tap ins like he can and move as well and as fluid as he. He is not a donkey at all.  I am being sarcastic. He is Falcao mark 2.
I am sure Fulham will stay up. They create chances. They are worse teams in the league. Thing Sheffield united, west brom and Burnley are worse then them. Burnley look shocking and I have no idea how they have as many points as they do. They make that 11 point Derby team look good.
Once again Sky Sports leave out the tackle on Fred from Loftus-Cheek in the 10th minute which should have been a penalty for United.
No one going to talk about Pogba 😏
Jesus is coming soon
Back where we belong! Top of the league, fantastic football!
Fernandes was really unlucky not to score that post-ricochet attempt 😔
Souness is glad the game was on BT Sport
Pogba=zidane atm
The world is a better place when united are top
Harry Maguire has a right 50p head and it’s so infuriating because he wins literally every head on a corner
Pogboom 🚀
0:25 Maguire decided to be the midfielder and leave Pogba to be the CB. What a waste of 80 mil. He cant even head balls unmarked. Shocking
When everyone says pogba needs to be at his best so Manchester United can win the prem, pogba plays incredibly well three games in a row, hopefully we won't lose a single game accept to possibly man City
Defence tightening up, midfield looking more balanced, forwards yet to click into gear. 21 is coming.
When your progba is misfiring get yourself a Fernandez.   Progba weren’t great first 15 minutes but grew into the game it’s great to see him playing with a smile on his face as a football fan! When you have that quality in midfield you always have a chance..
Cavani should be first choice. He's a goalscorer.
It just shows Bruno shows up in these games but against the big 6 yes even arsenal he just disappears
Pogba Habibi
Maguires header world class
First goal was offside
I bet the bin dippers aren’t laughing at pogba and Cavani anymore.. pogba is a changed man and cavani is the striker we desperately needed!
People be acting like pogba is world class because he scored one good goal in a game might as well call him kevin de pogba
Top of the league. Glory glory man utd ⚽ 🎉
What a goal by Pogba ⚽ 🥅  Sign a new contract mate POGBOOM
Cavani what a player 😍
Nice
FanTasTic
When will they learn that if they cross the ball they will sccore
Pogba has finally started to focus on the game
That passion from cavani💪
17 games unbeaten away 👌
Martial is the only player that keeps on disappointing. We should have signed Mandzukic.
OLE OLE OLE OLE OLE OLE OLE OLE OLE.OLE TOP of the league. Daily Mirror and rubbish pundits having a go at Bruno shows they know nothing about football. Well played Bruno Pogba Cavani Shaw. What a strike by Pogba.
Do anyone else see a Van Nistelrooy vibe about Cavani's movement and play in the box?
Well played Fulham.
Pogba’s officially back
BRUNO IS BACK!!!!!
Manchester United top league
cavani 🔥
How is this the best league in the world fulham keeper gives the goal away man u put no pressure in the fulham guy then pogba has no pressure to set up for a shot the keeper should save utter shite
Another comeback
My Love For United Has Come Back
So bad
WHEN U REALISE THAT POGBA WOULD STILL LEAVE AT THE END OF THE SEASON 🤔 A YEAR LEFT ON HIS CONTRACT N HE WON’T SIGN NO CONTRACT WITH UNITED💯💯  UNITED WILL NOT WANT FOR HIM TO LEAVE FOR FREE SO THEY WILL 💯 SELL HIM THIS SUMMER
Glad I put £50 at the start of the season on Utd
See this is what can happen when you play Pogba in his correct position
Man Utd comeback an early set back to win with a stunner from Pogba enable Utd back to Top spot.
pogba clear
Solksaer has to go 😂😂
Absolute stonewall penalty on Fred in the first half
Up the reds!!!
I think Greenwood just needs a goal to get his confidence back then hopefully his form will improve because he’s actually such a baller
United defence is more open then a convertible
Cavani's movement off the ball is brilliant
Ever since pogbas agent stirred the pot it seems pogba has played exceptionally well
"Perfect start for Fulham"  Bro, have you not seen Uniteds away record
Man city last year was winning like 5 nill every game  just cause they keep the ball and are clever with it !!!
To be fair as ultd fan that looked off side
Where are all the fans giving ole his props?
United need to keep on the ball and not give it away from the first min can’t be waiting for the officials to call the offside when he diddnt
United 💥💥💥💥💥
I'm sorry but after that first goal please never compare Trent to wan bisaka he stood still nothing even looking at the ball plays him on side then walks at him pretty much
how the hell are we top of the league when that's the kind of goals we're conceding
Cavani was some signing, he’s been great for us
Home Team: *scores first United: So you have chosen death
I’m just searching for Chief Wiggums comment 🧐
Just shows how mourinho can destroy a players confidence. I hope he leaves spurs and Alli can start playing well again
Fulham keeper needs a few games off by the looks. Garbage
Eventually relying on individual moments of brilliance will catch up with utd. Both pogba and fernandes are great but as we've seen with pogba, they can't always be in form. When those 2 aren't playing great the team collapses.
Pogba is underrated
Cavani is unbelievable!!! We have to keep him in the starting line up, him and Bruno are Linkin so well! 💯🔥
Why does Bailey run so weird
Cavani is a poacher Pogba a Beast.
Pogba > thiago
yes well done on getting lucky... yet again 😂
We all know pogba is class. Not suprised.
These commentators are so irritatingly rubbish, aren't they?
Conor grants was better
Some good football from united
Cavanis absolutely class, always running and putting pressure on whoever has the ballet nearest to him, puts rashfors and martial to shame
Already had my snidy comment about click bait titles partly typed then seen pogbas goal go in. Putting it back in the holster for now but I've got my eye on you Sky Sports
Pogboom back at it again
Cavani should be starting over martial and rashford
GGMU
Loftus cheek was class in the world cup and even better now, somehow still a hidden talent
Utd are definitely the luckiest team on the planet.More luck
Funny how pogba has actually been performing ok since man utd have started contending 😂
If man city stay 2 points behind united and win their game in hand then it'll be Man city's title to lose
Wow, great goal by Pogba. Massive game for my team Liverpool tomorrow. For me Man City are the favourites for the league. Most open league title race in years, happening 👍
We got ourselves a title race, boys! Let's do this!
Citeh wished they had Cavani lol. He actually does not even get service but his movement and workrate is ridiculous. The way they spam crosses for fun, Cavani would be their perfect 9. Glad they did not buy him.
The fact how Man U were able to beat Fulham and spurs not who did best Man U 6-1 is insane
Player of the month: Paul Pogba.
build the bruno statue  now
Funny to think people scoffed at utd signing cavani, saying he's over the hill
Can we just talk about how great the season has been so far, we haven’t had such a good title race in so long. Leicester went first yesterday, Man City went first a few hours ago and now it’s Man Utd! It keeps changing and it’s absolutely brilliant. Shame we can’t see it in person
If Man United got a scanner to scan my heart, they will apologise 🙄🙄😢
Pogba is on form stunner in every title
Let’s talk about canvani poj and Bruno
Pogba is back to his best again 💪🏻
my team 😍😍😘😘🥰🥰
How lazy were the defence on Fulham goal. Not 1 defender actually tried to run. Light jogging at best. Worse defence in the league dunno if it wasn't Bruno fernandes fc you would lose most games. Like Shaw belongs in league 1 wan-bisaka should be in championship. Maguire has a 50p head!
Not really that impressive is it they are scraping there way through games that they should be dominating
Whereas amitab now? The mug
Graeme Souness after this game: "Pogba was terrible, however he was a little less terrible today than usual..."
Can’t wait for Sky Sports to go on about Pogba’s goal every day for the next 2 months
Leicester win. Go top.  City win. Go top.  United win. Go top.  Liverpool win? Stay 4th. ;-)
Bailly nearly scored a own goal 😂
City little shits got happy they were first for a second 🤣🤣
Nice goal pogba
I’ve always said cavani needs starts over rashford, he’s much better it’s not even comparable. Banging goal from pogba by the way!
Pogba only scores of its to send Man U top of the table
It is a must Cavani to start again loserpool on Saturday 👏
Fred🔥🔥
Pogba goes from just watching Lookman stroll past him to score but then he goes and scores the winner. Just about Sums him up.
Remember when the Cavani signing was getting ridiculed? What a top boy.
Areola is class
Roy Keane: Pogba's got to work on his finishing   Pogba:
Cavani movement is world class and he's a very hard worker. Very underrated.
You can never tell with Pogba. He handed Fulham the first goal and then scores that...
When Pogba has his confidence he's unplayable
Nobody talking about the stone wall penalty we weren't given.
Pogba jogging back like a pro
pogba the spastic didnt track back
Surprised my heart didn't go away
Am still wondering why people are against Pogba yet he has scored both goals that take us to the top😂😂😂
Such a good goal by pogba on his weak foot!! 🥴
Haters last week: "sTunNiNg StRiKe?! iT ToOk A mAsSiVe DeFlEcTiOn!! OvErRaTeD pLaYeR!" Pogba this week: "Hold my left foot..."
What a hit by PP🔥💫. GGMU 🔴🔴🔴🔴
Pogba haters real mad, keep his name out your mouths pls and thank-you
No Fulham and no I’m not biased for Fulham to win to stop the title race I jus like them
People say that Cavani is ancient yet is younger than last seasons golden boot winner Jamie Vardy, a good 3-4 years we could have him firing for us. Fit as a fiddle and the guy is magic! GGMU
I will be happy when Maguire leaves.
From these highlights all the defenders should be sacked. No one went for lookman which let him score and no one went for pogba and he scored. There were 3 defenders who had a chance to block pogba from shooting and only 1 attempted it
Jamie Carragher will have to start swallowing words about Pogba soon
I just think that if the god of the Bible and Koran are evil negative distortion that feeds of human emotion they feed of fear i have objective evidence to
Pogba has really stated stepping up again instead of giving stupid pens
Luke Shaw is criminally underrated
I saw a pogba post a few days ago 👀👀
Pogba is finally starting to show his hunger and passion for the club! ❤️
Manchester United on top love it keep this form up come on u Reds 🔴🔴🔴
With diallo and pellistri to come in man utd champions elect
Where you at haters😆 loving seeing my team back bossing it under the reigns of my favourite player growing up, BIG up Ole and the boys.
Graeme Sounnes shaking right now
Smh, when are other teams realise, YOU SHOULD NEVER SCORE IN THE FIRST HALF AGAINST MAN U
1:49
Bruno united
Looking much better attacking wise utd but still need a cb.
Wont win the league defending like that and that's coming from a united fan
Souness: The cheek of Pogba, to not even curl that ball better for his goal? And the fact that it wasn’t top left hand corner? The man still isn’t good enough👀
actual stunner from Pogba this time, player of the month
They look terrible
What is maguire doing for that first goal🤦🏻‍♂️
Gary Neville tells Utd line to step up, that's what happens...
Where’s Souness when u need him
It won’t last seen it all before
In Gary we trust. Spot on with pogba
Haters mad,Haters mad 💥
Man city basically top with game in hand.
Why is it almost every game this week the winning side gets top of the table
Pogba seems to have gone up a level in consistency.
COME ON BOYS 21 IS COMING 🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
Cavani is a player
How can a 34 year old Cavani run and work harder that Rashford, Martial and Greenwood. Them boys could learn a thing or 2 from him. GgMu ❤.
0:32 why are they jogging? We cant win a league like this
She’s a beauty
Never understood when united fans want Pogba out, the guys class
I screamed when I saw that pogba goal  Come on united
Pogba be like "Buy me! Buy me! There's only ten days of the window left! Look! I do know how to play! Buy me! Buy me!"
Fulham had 26 passes in the lead up to their  goal and nobody says a word about it??? I will then - it was a superb team goal from them and they were a very good team tonight 👍. Signed a Manchester United fan
My satellite stopped working for the last 20 minutes because of the weather. I’m fuming
If everyone stays fit we have a real chance. 21 in 2021 👀 🙏🏻. GgMu ❤.
We got to keep this momentum going, i like how pogba starting to step up a bit and cavani should start over martial imo, he smells a goal from a mile away before he pounces to it. I don’t like utd going behind and then getting the goals after all the time but hey a win is a win. Just gotta take one game at a time🔴
Im not really fan of Man U but it’s so great to see them in the top it’s remind me the great man united 😊
Paul wants to win things n I think he thinks this side can
Pogba is the best mid in the prem atm🔥🔥
Areola is actually a class keeper
Fernandes what a player
Love seeing pogba do well
Man Utd fans you will never win the league for a long time. All the money you have spent and still can’t win the league. Your finishing out of the top four this season.
Pogba 🤩🤛💪
What a goal of pogba
Wtf were the defence doing on the 1st goal? Casual asf
Fulham owe the league an apology for not getting anything
Nice closing down by Pogba for the Fulham’s goal
Areola needs to improve his handling it’s costing them goals and vital points
Paul labile pogba
Man City are winning the league!
No reason for us not to believe that we can win the title this year.
Bruno and Cavani have a lil somtin somtin going on on the pitch and it is beautiful
Franz Maguire
Pogba Since you've Been back at the club I've not been your biggest fan but         (WOW WHAT A GOAL!!) Credit where credit's due well played Pogba please play like this all the time!
We should’ve gone 1-0 down against Liverpool then we would have won
Martial had a stinker tonight  Greenwood seems to of gone off the boil lately Apart from cavani.....them 3 need to  hit some goals if utd do wanna keep up the pace at the top
Cavani is class should play him all the time
Jeez pogba's goal a thing of beauty.  Keep it going reds .
3 screamers this season we move
Start cavani over martial
Have to admit that was a class goal
Man Utd haven’t beaten any of the so called “big 6 teams” overrated team not winning anything
TOP OF THE TABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can you not put the score in the thumbnail?
Maguire needs to score that header
*Play Lingard against Arsenal so he can moonwalk at the dancefloor🕺🙅‍♂️*
why don’t pogba dab anymore ?
POGBOOM BABY
Cavani and Pogba are vital in providing Man Utd goals and assists when Bruno and Rashford aren't at it. Martial and Greenwood also need to rediscover that goal scoring form from last season if Man United have any chance of winning the league.  Pogba, Bruno and Cavani have to start every game. Cavani is better in front of goal than Rashford and Martial. World class movement.
Let’s go back at top cmon the boys
Ok it’s 80 mil players he’s free oh the hea................
Who's the lead commentator?
That pogba goal was actually so beautiful I’m so happy we won today to go top again
Graeme souness must be in pain
What a goal by Paul Pogba, especially on his weaker foot, what a strike, what a win, HUGE win indeed.
Can I get 1k likes please
MAGUIRE IS A LIABILITY LOOK AT HIS POSITIONING FOR THE FIRST GOAL. HE SHOULD BE DEMANDING PLAYERS TO GET INTO THEIR CORRECT POSITIONS WHILST CONTROLLING THE BACK LINE...THIS GUY IS VERY OVERRATED A SO CALLED TOP CLASS DEFENDER IS CAUGHT BALL WATCHING. A SIMPLE SHAW "MAN BEHIND YOU"  OR "FRED DROP BACK, WATCH YOUR SHOULDER" OR POGBA "THAT'S MY MAN PICK UP NO..."  THIS IS MEANT TO BE OUR CAPTAIN LOL. I DON'T CARE TO WIN THIS LEAGUE THINGS LIKE THIS CANNOT HAPPEN.  WE CAN JOKE AND LAUGH ABOUT SCORING GOALS AND COMING BACK FROM BEHIND BUT THAT  COVERS THE CRACKS OF  POOR DEFENDING.
As a psg fan, it's really weird seeing cavani score past areola
1:47 is what you all came for.
Pogba's amazing goal. Ummm cherry on top of the sweet cake. LET'S GOO 😁
Frogba
POGBOOOM
Pogba only plays well when it’s the transfer window- the guy’s an inconsistent mess
Martial is 25...
What a goal
*LET'S GOOOOO!!!* Wins like these are SO IMPORTANT! 🔴🔴🔴
Glory glory man United
Love Cavani’s celebration. All passion, you can see he’s just All In!
GGMU💥💥💥
I don't know what the pogba critics are going to come out with.
Cavani what a steal ! What a great player utd have got on their books.
i swear every week i watch these highlights Areola makes a worldie save. should be playing for a better team than fulham.
Can't believe VAR didn't deem that a foul on Fred in the penalty area! How is a defender running in and clattering the attacking player from behind, and getting nowhere near the ball, not a clear foul!? The PL / FA are out of order not penalising these managers who keep coming out influencing the referees by discussing Man United's penalty record and comparing them to other teams. It's blatantly attempting to influence the officials to hinder United now that they're a force again. And, unsurprisingly, it's working. Every decision that goes United's way is now a major talking point. So, as the managers intended, refs are now bottling it and scared to give it.
Even if United don't win the league this season they are having a much better season than people expected. Ole deserves a lot of credit for that.
All of these highlights titles are saying a team is being sent to the top the title race is crazy
I bet graeme gonna say “ I don’t think pogba meant to score that”
Thank god we won after citeh robbed Aston villa .
I knew pogba was always that player that out of nowhere would find himself out of the shadows. Always was a fan of his.
Cavani jammy goal
Utd will win the title and Ole will be Knighted.
Coming from a Liverpool Fair play Man U
well looks like the officials have fallen for Klopps United penalty claims because that again was stone wall pen or isit just this Kevin Friend nob?
Manchester Utd will not win nothing this season mark my words!
I swear I nearly got a heart attack from the sloppy Eric Bailey back pass😭🤯
Paul pogba has always been a fraud he’s always had world class quality he just choose not to
Maguire is a fridge!
Lack lustre in defence! Cavani is a game changer!
how can carragher say pogba is overrated name me a player that woould score banger after banger like that nobody other than perhaps de bruyne
United back to their best: winning away games after going behind first.
Martial ain’t good enough if we wanna progress as a club
Coming into form at the right time. Fancy United to win it this year - never thought I'd be saying that.
man city are winning
Shoutout to Ruben loftus cheek. Amazing performance
Frogba
Wish Pogba was more consistent
Fulham play great football. Their attacking build up is so much more fluid and incisive than a ton of the top teams
I wonder will Carragher be able to put his pride aside and give pogba credit for once or continue to be bitter and stubborn
Was the camera angle during this match annoying anyone else
Klopp has got to the refs head and now refs aren’t doing their jobs properly because they’re scared of what people will say about them and how people will question their ability to officiate. That’s exactly what happened today, there was a clear cut pen on for United on Fred and the ref didn’t give it. If that was anywhere else on the pitch except from the 18 yard box that would’ve been a free kick.
Don't throw now boys
Misses from 6 yards and scores from 27.goes to show its all in the head and some players want to be the hero to much pressure then kicks in.
POGBOOM 💫🚀
i dont get the hype for wan bissaka tbh, he gets nowhere near the england squad, yet united fans say hes the best rb in the league
Pogba and Bruno are the best midfielders in the league Pass it on...
The amount of titles that have “sends ... back to the top” is incredible
ManU conceded the goal bc of mcguier if you notice he didn’t even look back to see if anyone is behind him and was rushing to cover a player that’s already covered 🤦🏼‍♂️
Pogba is back to his best ✊🏿🙏🏿☝🏿
maguire realy needs to improve his attacking headers ...glad we saw this one through
Since Pogbas come in Fernandez has declined. No room in the Palace for 2 kings it seems
It's crazy to think that Lukaku would thrive at United this season.
It's nice to see 2 wee teams doing well.
Poor for the first 20 from united but the reaction good
This Pogba is on fire one of the best midfielder
Glory glory Man Utd ❤️
Fink the reason why United play better away from home is cos the Glazer-Virus hangs over OT!
what a sad time to be alive
This is very similar of Utd of old, only difference is if they win the league then they'll be moving towards them. Pogba may be the decisive leader that carry them to the finish line. He's big moment type player, and if he stays fit till the end, Utd might just sneak it.
Taken a few years but pogba has finally remembered where he is 😂
United are still shite . Not a hope they will win the league..
Consistent Pogba = World class 😍😍
Guys everyone who is saying Man U will win are shmuks and don’t know there football because don’t get me wrong there are a great team but they need better players they need  a striker defender and more squad depth like what if what happened to Liverpool happen to Man U they would struggle so much because Liverpool have been a better team for 4 years so if they struggle Man U will definitely struggle massively so they can’t just go from a bad team with no direction to a premier league winning team it takes Time but don’t get it wrong they are a great team a are amazing to watch at times but they can’t rely on inconsistent players like martial pogba and others.
Pogba is actually playing well???😬
Why no vdb again! Just give him half an hour a game at least!
fair play to pogba, that was a serious goal, great touch and 3 men around him, unreal. from a chelsea fan
As a Chelsea fan, we have no chance of the title, and so I want either Man Utd or Leicester to win it
It’s good we got 40 points, we’re not going to get relegated 😂😂😂
I swear pogba only scores bangers
Hi
Fred had a good solid game, under the radar but very impressive imo
Cant believe no one is showing replays of the clear foul on fred which should of been a pen before cavani scored
This pogba- fernandez thing is becoming lethal
Yea Man U will finish 3rd
Pogba saved us again✊🏻
So when liverpool or City win this year's Premier league will they be giving 2 trophys because United won it in January?
To be fair that was a stunner from Paul pogba
When you see pogba on this form, this is why you know the job is to big for Ole. Our best player by far is only playing to leave the club. We need a proper manager
Pogbaaaaaa
Our toughest game of the season so far, Fulham are a good side and deserve to be higher up the table. Extremely important win by the lads and Pogba you little beauty. GGMU ⚪🔴⚫
Areola made one mistake but made three good saves
Poxy Pogba
It’s time these pundits start putting respect on Pogba’s name! 👏🏾
Donny van de beek still watching on like 👁👄👁
Top of the League. Business resumes as normal 👌
POGBOOM
Areola is so underrated
Check out my recent videos I post fifa content and memes
GGs
Cavani has to start the big games now. His attacking threat and awareness is unbelievable and his defensive shift is crucial. He is such an all round striker and one we need in the team.
Thats what mourinho meant in his Amazon Spurs team talk about closing down Pogba.
United always give me a heart attack towards the end of the game. This isn't good for my health but we're top of the league ❤
United need to start killing games off instead of defending a one goal lead. Their goal difference is not good enough to be challenging for the title. Something needs to change. I have a feeling united will once again not beat arsenal. They haven't beaten arsenal in the league in a while now. Like close to three years. That's not good enough. Greenwood has gone off form this season compared to what he was end of last season. Hopefully he turns things around the second half of the season, as the second half of the season has officially started from the next game which is against Sheffield
manchester united and fred flinstones won finally fred can say        yaba daba doo
Paul podge is my dad and am white
Wan bissaka is criminally underrated i understand that he made one mistake, but in the second half he showed us why we signed him
Please can someone subscribe to me please
Haters gone quiet? That’s right 🤫🤫🤫🤫
Squeaky bum time
Can we appreciate cavani, he has showed how clinical he is and his movement is on another level
Remember folks. Liverpool had so many unconvincing wins last year when they won the league. United did well to come back today 👏
Pogba💯🔥
When there's no external distractions Pogba is a match winner for Utd. Play well, keep the fans on your side, show loyalty and commitment and give it your all week in week out. Lead from the front. 😊
Gosh that was a nervy ending! Good win but hate how we just sit deep and invite pressure once we take the lead!
Can we have some appreciation for Fred? He did really well as a cdm today. I'd like to see him in this role from now on. We had Fred holding, with Pogba & Fernandes ahead. Similar to how city have fernandinho holding with gundogan & kdb ahead.
Pogba goal is one of the best I seen this season
Where are all the united fans that were hating on pogba???? Where are all the pundits and football fans saying pogba is overrated???  Sit down you bunch of TW@TS.
Cavani was class today. By far out best no.9
What a banger from pogba...
Glory glory man united glory glory man united
An inform pogba is good for football (from a Liverpool fan)
Hope pogba leaves in the summer for everyone’s sake before he becomes tooooo good 😭 🤦🏽‍♂️ (Arsenal Fan)
Pogboom is back
Could have easily been 5-3 to United, chances missed and credit to Fulham who were well organised. We got the three points and that’s all the matters. On to the next game.
Pogba at fault for Fulham goal as he just let the striker go. Redeemed himself with a beautiful winning  goal.
Liverpool fans right now "Mum it's happening again"
what a banger
Nice finish from lookman
Manchester United: concede a goal Opposition: oh here we go again
i swear lookman was offside . people are saying he isnt but lookman he is
I thought he was washed up and finished, I doubted him. But Cavani has been exactly what was needed on so many occasions.
That first Fulham goal good finish but the defenders might aswell have just walked back .
Cavani's movement off the ball was fantastic. If only we could’ve had him 5 years ago.
lookman has somehow managed to recover his reputation after that penalty, respect to the lad
Weird to see united doing well after rough start while we crumble a bit(Liverpool fan). To put aside all the salt as much as it is annoying, it's pretty good to have a good rivalry again. At least your will dish out some banter, which is what it's all about at end of the day 😂 You better not win league though cba with it going that far like ;)
When are we going to have an honest discussion about martial? He's been here 7 seasons & only broke the 20 goal barrier once. This season he hasn2 goals in 15 pl games. But instead we're criticising a defender (AWB) for not doing better offensively when he's been exceptional defensively
I dont think Manchester United are 1st because of their gold difference
This might be the first time I’ve seen the whole team working really hard playing like they won’t accept anything other than a win this season. Cavani fernandes Shaw were all brilliant
If sojasker sends pogba his dumb after all the times he’s saved us
Love to see it ❤️
He’s put himself in the shop window alright...
PogFudgingBoom!
Pogb back on top
Back Where We Belong.
Both Manchester sides narrowly beating teams you’d expect they’d normally beat comfortably
Brogba was brilliant, Bruno and pogba constantly creating for the whole game
PogbaBoom!🔥🔥
Souness is still going to criticse Pogba about the direction and power of the strike. "Hes a world class player, he could hit it cleaner"
this title race is actually exciting now
Ngl I think I had 3 heartattacks in the last 10 minutes
Pogba is becoming world class
Let’s push for the title now 💪  GGMU🔴⚫️🔴⚫️
Cmon United
Cavani’s work rate makes me want to go do some sprint training
3 different leaders in the  last 24 hours.  Ever happened before?
What a title race this is turning out to be,So many teams going for title   Top spot as changed three times in the space of 24 hours
If u are a premier league team this season and you are at home against United. Don’t score first or you’ll lose.
I've been disgusted at the criticism AWB has been getting. He's THE BEST defensive rb in the league, his tackling is IMPECCABLE. Why are we criticising him for his offensive ability when he's a defender & has been defending really well? Meanwhile STRIKERS like Martial who has 2 in 15 are getting off the hook
Loftus cheek almost gave me a heart attack
Come on Wilfred Bony, score some goals for swansea
Tbf to Pogba he’s turned up when united and Bruno needed him the most to take weight off shoulders, his only issue is consistency every year
Cavani - absolutely quality signing. Movement and finishing still world class.
1:03 love that passion!!
Why do United want to sell pogba  He a man in form atm  And knows how to score
Ademola Lookman is actually Underrated
Pogba is world class it's that simple. I don't care whether you like him or hate him
Areola is such an underrated keeper
Im a liverpool fan but i have to say paul pogba has been amazing last few games and he is one of my favourite players its a shame he plays for united and i can see him as a Bayern Munich or juventus player
whens diallo making his debut?
Penandes invisible in a game with no pens 😂
cavani actually is underrated his movement he knows where he wants the ball. As a Chelsea fan i would love to see cavani stay at man utd for 2 years i wanna see what him and fernades can do at full potential
If u score against utd in the first half just know you’ve lost
Pogba doing his best to catch zidane attention
We are Top of the Premier League i said we are Top of the Premier League 21 😈 2021 😈
Every single fan of our great club that has slated pogba or had anything bad to say about him..you really will miss him when hes gone in the summer. What a goal 🔥🔥🔥
What a beast cavani is a lot of people doubted him glad he proving them wrong.
What a game by me eh
I think Klopp has really gotten in referee's head. They're really not giving us anything. The Maguire one last week and fred this week at least should've gone to VAR!
Man United’s scapegoat strikes again !
I'm actually surprised
Meanwhile, Graeme Souness is hiding in a corner......
frist time ive had to listen to those mongy bt commentators for a while😳Same again next week when we play sheffield🙄🙄
Let's face it. A fridge can't score headers
I just love how passionate cavani is when he scores a goal you can tell he's playing for the badge to get us back to the glory days
How many times is maguire gonna miss the same sort of header 😂
Just for perspective:  United have failed to win against any of the big sides. Today again they've scraped a win. Realistically United will probably finish 5th or 6th with the table ending as:  1) City 2) spurs 3) Liv 4) Leicester 5) Chelsea  6) United
Funny how everyone turns against pogba, yet I’m practically the only person who wants him to stay and think he’s a great player but now he’s playing good everyone thinks he’s good when I’ve always thought that
The Pogba we all love to see
PogBACK
Is number u coming for man city or is number 21 coming for man utd
Where the Pogba haters at 👀👀
What is the penalty rule now cause the one on Fred was stonewall
Paul pogba world class end of
How Bruno was names man of the match will always confuse me guy is quite overrated and I feel pogba Cavani and shaw had a better performance today
Aaron wan bissaka just isnt good enough at the minute hes went off a clip since the football came back after covid
Utd got away with it could easily have been a draw.
Well, Tony Khan isn’t going to enjoy AEW Dynamite live today.
Pogba on form is unstoppable.....
Pogba stealing Bruno’s spotlight fair play to him though he has been on top form
Congratulations Man U fans ! After a bad start you deserve a top spot . Don't loose it !
Parker needs to go. Hes confused, you play 5 at the back,  just soaking up unnecessary pressure, play from the back when you don't have the personel to do so, you're not Man City. Doesn't play a striker, what sort of negative football is this? Then start the useless Loftus Cheek. Hes set up to maybe get a draw from games. Draws won't keep you up, take some risks, why not play both Cavaliero and Mitrovich? He needs to go
Never doubted pogba world class
Ooh lord, no amount of WD40 could have stopped my arse squeaking at the end.
Third inform pogba incoming lol
Andy "Maguire should score more goals" Townsend
Lads there’s still 18-19 games relax your teams on a decent spell now u think  ur gonna win the league 😬😂😂
Pogboom!
pogba is back !!!!
What a difference pogba has been since his agents nonsense
pogba is really showing how good he is
Pogba is a talented player he just wasn’t working hard but I feel like now with the title ambition, it is pushing him to be at his best and this is proving that Pogba can be one of the best in the league
POGBOOOM
Very lucky that our players aren't perfect
Frogba 🐸 beast!
United's coach ride back to Manchester is never a dull one
Well played united pogba with a stunner cavani there for backup
Am I the only one who think the way utd are playing ain’t sustainable. They keep losing and relying on individual moments of magic and penalties. It’s working for them now but surely it can’t keep going on
next week: ole out
Didn’t everyone say Pogba was overrated a month ago 😬😬 Best midfielder in the world ⭐️
POGBOOM!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔴⚪️⚫️
I think k i said it last time aswell on another video where pogba scores. I swear he only scores bangers outside the box.
huge props to areola. he’s an experienced keeper who played amazing tonight. fulham have been gifted a class keeper
Pogba is back 😈
POGBACK ! Pogba has been class recently and you can’t deny it, Cavani was also excellent today his movement for the goal and the areola save was incredible and his finishing is top class. He look like a proper number 9 that will take us forward !
Like for Pogba's goal to be voted goal of season
Silly goal by pogba
as a chelsea fan and after all the stick i have gave man utd over the years is hitting hard now that was a banger from pogba
GGMU
Gary said he’d be one to watch, he wasn’t wrong.
AWB is not good enough.
Just here for the salt and tears.
Pogba has been class for United  this season
The same TITLE again
That pogba strike is a contender for goal of the month
Pogba goal 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
Fulham really don’t play football like they’re 18th. Credit to Scott Parker, I hope they stay in the Premier league
AWB plays football like Bambi
Pogba finally showing me the player i was worried about when man utd first signed him
Pogba incredible 🔥
It really looks like Bailly is finally staying fit he really is playing class
PogBOOM💥💥💥💥
Fernandes what a player man.I don't know what united will do without him.
I’m so early
gang
Is it just me or is anyone else confused why van de beek gets no play time at all, other than that today we had an amazing comeback🔴🔴
Pogba- form is temporary class is permanent
United After 19 games 19/20: 28 points 20/21: 40 points
Fulham are poo poo 😹😹😹💩💩💩🤑🤑🤑
Pogba saving us again he really is the clutch player we need
Ok honestly I love Man Utd I rlly do but jeez they really need to start attacking more aggressively and getting the ball forward much more. I hate how slow we are playing we should show that we mean business we are not letting any1 take our 1st place
Disappointed to see AWB performing so poor defensively over the past couple of weeks
Bet mowatt would have been beter than fred
Best pogba I've seen in a while 💪
GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED
Back to the top come on ❤️❤️
pogba is a person we need. his decisive goals is why we need him. hopefully he stays at united for at least the rest of the season. COYR❤️
Yessss
What a stunning goal from pogba
Paul GOATPA.... The GOAT brah!!
Keep it up united
Pogba proving his haters wrong🔴🔴😛😛🤫🤫
Mad early
Pogboom!
Man City has had there taste of being first.. not for long
Come on
Man united and coming from behind name a better duo
POGBA SIGN DA TING!!!!!
:P
Fulham turn into prime Barcelona when they play a top 6 team
Pogba dragging Utd kicking and screaming to the top of the league. SALUTE 💯💯
Ez win
Paul has really stepped up for Man Utd
As a united fan I don’t wanna say this but wan bisska attacking wise is TAA defensive wise it’s almost dreadful I don’t know what’s happened to wan this season
Even if we don’t win the league, all Man Utd fans must admit this has been the most exciting season for us in terms of league position since Sir Alex left.   We feel like we can really challenge for the title in a season where 4-5 teams can realistically win the league
United just love to give me a near heart attack every game near the end
Manchester is RED!!!
When pogba and bruno play together united have the best midfield in the world
I really like our title chances if Pogba keeps this form
Luke Shaws performance was so underrated
Nobody... Mark Goldbridge :  WE ARE TOP OF THE LEAGUE WE ARE TOP OF LEAGUE   But seriously we are top
This is the most exciting title race I’ve seen in years, cmon united!
Here early👑👑
PogBOOOOOM
Pogba is a flop..... isn’t he?
Sky sports fast af with these highlights
Ole really needs to make subs earlier. Always after bloody 80+ mins.
Pogba has improved a lot recently
Not his best game but Cavani is a class act. His movement, tracking back and a well taken goal
Lookman is criminally underrated
POGBA HATERS COME OUTSIDE
Good win back up at the top!
Before we all start calling him world class look at his positioning for Fulham’s goal 👍
Kick-start all the comments of United fans on how there going to win the league 🤣🤣
Top of the league! GGMU ❤️
I was here first

Amazing game
Awb plays like there’s mud in his boots..
City and Leicester, we appreciate you for keeping the 1st spot warm. Now the biggest club in england have reclaimed the throne..........
After the raiola incident pogba has played very well top player...
