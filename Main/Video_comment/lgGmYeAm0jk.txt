Oh wow it just gets better and better
5:48😂😂😂
4:17 "You may now elect a chairman" Jackie Weaver says after silencing her opposition like a dictator 😂
Whats this even about
Assemblywomen
I wondered for long time why Youtube kept recommending this video to me and i skipped it so many times but now i am very glad i clicked on it.  🤣 Pure comedy
so these idiots are in charge of what?
Bet this was wild when they had a face to face meeting again 😂
2000 years ago St Paul said women shouldn't be in charge of men
Better than television, just so funny, all of them are the very best of boomers.
Most insane power grab in modern history
5:03 "You don't know what you're taking about!" "The Chairman, the chairman of the council is...  the chairman of the, of the, uh... the Council"
British when asking to mow the lawn:
5:48 Gollum and Smeagal Fighting
This was a very good example of bullying within Cheshire East.  And...and the environs.
3:00 Julie’s iPad, icon that you are
These are the people that blame the youth and immigrants for the sorry state of this country.  It's like this at every single level of government
a council consisting of a beta male and a bunch of women.... booting out a bunch of guys pointing out rules...
This is an amazing insight into why women are not made for politics. And anyone who disagrees doesn’t know what “politics” means.
Rooting for Alan and Sue
PETER MOORE.... whispering F-off at start-LOL.. him + brian do not get on @ 0.10 sec 🤣😂
2:15 the sudden shift in tone was so startling I choked on my drink 💀
Imagine this country once had an empire........ how the f**k did that happen?
And they get paid for this?
Its just like this in my apartment council in Finland where I am a board member. It seems in the UK they are even more cunty than in Finland 😂
these Councillors and council lawyers are a joke
10:51 Cyn bringing the heat damn
You have a set of rules. You have a chairman. Hold your own meetings and exclude her. Maybe then you can something done. Being respectful to a hindrance an object of retardation of progress that bans chairmen from thier own meetings? No thats not how it's done. Why did you even agree to this? Get your grandson or granddaughter to set up the meeting next time. This is what happens when people with power lusts are given a modicum of power. Simply exclude illegal activity until they play properly. 100 percent ignore her and non compliance will make her so mad she will dig her own grave. Good luck people 👍 ❤ do a good job and remember why you are there. Not for yourselves but the people you represent. The devil exists especially in these places and it hides and obfuscate and uses these kinds of tactics to make you loose control and get angry. Effectively using my advice against you.
Oh my god I’m cracking up. Reminds me of my own little town meetings sometimes. Thanks for a laugh !!
Cyn is/was a real piece of work.
This was written by David Mitchell and Olivia Coleman
As it turns out, Jackie Weaver had, in fact, no authority.
A sub committee of the steering group , that’s sounds like a riveting team to join 😂
To be fair, Jackie Weaver was in the wrong at the start of the meeting - talking all over the chair and acting as a proper officer
Alan with his iPad got some comedy gold first hand 😂😂😂
"I have never seen such a strongly worded letter from a monitoring officer to a local council, 25 years." Never has a more British statement been uttered.
Jackie Weaver has no authority here!
Parish turf wars 😂
REEEEAD THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM !!!!!! 😂😂😂
Handforth is the real life Hot Fuzz.
Years later you lot are still a hoot (and as petty as each other 😂😂😂)
I don't get it. It's just a pedantic bunch of old people trying their best.  Is this supposed to be funny or cringe or informative or what?
UK has become completely controlled by domineering, schoolmarm types like Jackie Weaver. Tyranny by HR women.
This is like a Mike Leigh film.
I've never seen the extended directors cut before.
Uuhhh😱
Dreadful pedantic little people. Power-drunk on no power. The best example I've seen of the Groucho Marx maxim 'the desire to be a councillor should bar you from ever being one'. That appaling little Gollum-like Scouser shouldn't be put in charge of a used band-aid, let alone a parish council.
the british people have never seen this sort of tyranny since the times of Cromwell
this video will be important in historical works in 75 years
This is absolute comedy gold 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
16:12 Nostradamus gives his prediction 😂 . He was bang on.
Jakie Weaver and Carol Baskin .. the evil queens of 2020
Ts unironically makes me wanna get into politics, jus bc I wanna c ppl argue about bs AND get paid for it😂
This is how I imagine every reform majority council meeting goes
RIP Bazza Burkhill
So formal and stuffy 😂
Wars have been waged with less fervour
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE JACKIE WEAVER NO AUTHORITY!
Aled is my hero.
why did gollum decide to join at 5:48
Just wondering if they're all stoned? Or maybe I am?!
Imagine having to minute this?!
This is what happens when you have women in meetings
A subcommittee of the steering group
No wonder the world is in the state it is
5:51 im literally being sent away to hell STOP
Why is this like a DnD GM trying to run a serious game for a bunch of teenagers?
This shite is why we left and founded The United States
We don’t want a turf war breaking out. I’m sorry??? A TURF WAR 😭😭😭
Now this is my idea of entertainment 🤣🤣🤣
The ladies love Alan 😻
What am I watching?
5:20 JACKIE AIN’T BEING RESPECTFUL. Would you let summun off your family if they were polite about it?
Jackie Weaver is a modern American democrat who values good vibes over law and order. She must be stopped at once.   Facts don’t care about your feelings JACKIE
Starmer vibes
Australian New Wave actress and academy award nominee Jackie weaver? Crazy…
This is one of my favourite videos of all times
18 minute committee meeting and absolutely NOTHING accomplished! I yield.
13:32 is absolutely wild
This is amazing
Who is John smith?, as Jackie put so well....."it makes no difference 😂"
4:17 he sounds perfect for a war general 😂
British passive aggression at its finest
Quite enjoyed when Gollum appears at 5:50
"Can we make this recording available?" 🤪️ "Of the zoom meeting?"
Godspeed Spiderman!!
This thumbnail is so chaotic
Who else is here October 2025? 😂 Jackie is such a villain 😂
And to think, this is a generalised representation of the councils and larger government of this nation..  Shocking, shameful and shameless 😂
Everyone in this parish council looked at a copy of Robert's Rules of Order and spat on the cover
We need an Imax cut
new life goal: to try my hardest to never be a jackie weaver.
Middle Englander dullard nobodies with nothing to worry about
I don’t know what in the fish and chips is happening but I want it to be a series
the real housewives of handforth parish council, still hilarious 5 years later
I have no idea whst they are talking about
MRS WEAVER PLEASE
Do I know what’s happening? No. Am I captivated? Yes.
Does Jackie Weaver have a pigeon? Why do I hear cooing?
ok, this was an absolutely wild watch and i had no idea what i was walking into.
Mrs Weaver Please!
Perfect reason why over 60s should not be in politics
5:50 Golum steals the scene really.
I keep coming back now and then and it’s still just as funny as it was the first time
What a productive bunch of people.
Sue is an underrated player here
LEGENDARY timeline pull. Can't believe i havent seen it before
I need a sequel to this
I'm crying 😂😂😂😂
These are the people that try to criticize the U.S. and act like theyve got it all figured out. U.K., you couldn't even figure out how to use the spices your gathered in your empire in your food. Fuck right off
The quiet "fuck off" at the start pmsl😂
everytime a name flashes on the screen, it feels like the next chapter has started
These are the exact kind of lonely miserable people that have drug this country into the gutter over the last 40 years
0:15 “I think it’s perhaps helpful just to go through the same things as we went through before, which is just to encourage people to switch of their microphones, because it does reduce the backgr-dg-khg-dkh-“ [unintelligable background noise]
God DAMN if there's one thing better than boomer tech struggles it's all out boomer pissing contests. Legendary.
Mythical algorithm pull
Has it started yet?
This video represented a very specific time in British history. If things hadn't been as they were this might have passed people by in a village hall somewhere (well Handforth I presume). You couldn't script something that hit everything this did.
These clowns are a perfect representation of why nothing ever gets done in our local councils. Especially planning.
May the gods bless Old White People.
5:49 started speaking in tongues
Handforth, the nicer end of Wythenshire.
Aled's iPad bringing Reece Shearsmith's incandescent and barely contained rage is glorious.
I'm getting such massive League of Gentlemen vibes from this and I can neither fully explain it, nor stop laughing at it. 😂
Can someone please explain to an Australian, is this a church council meeting or a regional council meeting? Are these peiple responsible for a town or just a church?
16:13 clocked it
7:57 Oooooo
WE'RETRYINGTUHAVATEAMSMEETINGYOUFOOL - never has one man's descent to the Dark Side been so totally mapped. Power corrupts, chaps
Classic
3:55 YOU HAVE NO POWER HERE.
My favourite part is the prolonged silence that followed after that guy made a joke
16:19 oh yes it has lol
The comments section has made this video a blockbuster lol
HOW BIG IS PETERS HAND?!?!? 14:45
The chemistry between Alan and Sue is electrifying…
5:50 someone on Aleds IPad turns into Gollum. What on earth is going on
The chairman of the meeting asks if he is assured he will not be thrown out of the meeting again   Gets thrown out of the meeting
thank you for the excellent captions!!!
HANDFORTH MENTION !?!?!?!?!?
Can you STOP being whatever it is you're trying to be !!!🤣
Whenever i've had a shit day , this is my go to! , comedy gold 😂😂😂
this is what I wanna do when im old, whatever this is
It’s like watching the different stages of substance abuse.
These are the kind of old men who would call women overly emotional while being completely unable to manage their own emotions on the smallest of things
Jackie Weaver...absolute diva! 😂
What am I watching?,,, it's like middle class gang warfare 😂
0:10 GREATEST OPENING EVER
6 minutes in when he turns into golloum 😂
"a copy of this will be sent to the monitoring office" ...and the whole world 😆
Not the greatest video of all time. the greatest THING of all time.
One of the most hilarious videos in existence. Feels like a skit hahah
I need to know the lore.
2020’s golden egg.
SUBPOENA!
5:56 - Gollum enters the chat
4 years later this is still pure gold. Would love to know where Jackie Weaver is now. Hope she got a promotion or 2 at least x
BBC news confirms that Jackie Weaver did not in fact have the authority.
Jackie weaver was so totally in the wrong during this. She should be thrown out of the meeting
Another cinematic universe that couldn’t be easily milked and destroyed by Disney
This is how people in reenactment are! 😂
Reminds me of dads army when they where arguing of who is chairman lol
This is the real reason why this country is fu*ked
I'm with the guy in blue
5:48 gollum??
The "F*** off" right at the start gets me every time 😂😂😂😂😂
This is the most disgraceful waste of time and energy I have seen in recent times. No wonder this country is going to hell if this is what the people who populate it spend their time doing. Idiots.
Jackie Weaver trolling Handforth Council 😅
What an absolute bunch of muppets. Shame British and the pompous gentleman should be ashamed and embarrassed beyond belief. But they won’t .
Someone should make a comedy movie based on these Handforth clips!.
Theres always some woman on a power trip trying to take over, and john smith is a giant cuck
Why am I watching this again 😅
Here comes the SUBPOENA!!!
The only thing better than this video is the comment section of this video. You're all too funny! 😂
Oooh how I love being British 😂 😂
Alan absolutely knocking out the crowd
Is this real?!
The bloke spinning around at the start like a sith lord.
How can you be called out for not attending meetings when theres not been any meetings? 😂
Ive been watching funny town hall videos from America. This video makes me so proud as an englishman. We just do it better 😂😂😂😂
Perfect example of old codgers not knowing how to use modern technology.
Never has there been so much knowledge and 0 sense being made ever 😂
“Can you make this recording available?” We all know John smith put this on YouTube 🤭
5:50 - Alan’s pal has turned into the exorcist 😲
Jackie Weaver is the villain here. She was interrupting everyone, ignoring everyone, assuming control etc. A person on a huge power trip and loving it
Those women and their coconspirators should all be in prison.
And this is how a pyramid falls
The British throwing shade properly.😂
Julie using the toilet and farting at random points is hilarious to me
This is so Vicar of Dibbley
Was that a toilet flushing at one point? 😂
The more I watch this (and it's been over hundreds of times at this point) the more I love Roger Small's brief walk towards the camera above anything else
True British society. It’s so ridiculous you can’t tell if it’s a skit or not. Love it
@5:49 Gollum has entered the meeting.
Absolute waffle. All jostling for status/position and achieving nothing.
We are very happy in our workplace.  The environment of the workplace:
WHERE’S THE CHAIRMAN!?       WHERE’S THE CHAIRMAN
We have video evidence of a coup
Jackie Weaver is the kind of person who ends up being head of a government department, and that's an insult
the epitome of bureaucracy
This is absolute gold 😂
Ugh. And we wonder what’s wrong with the church.
0:06 how dialogue starts in Oblivion
still as funny as it was 4 years ago i remember coughing my lung tissue out to this video jesus christ
Jackie Weaver’s got a bit of the dictator to her.
5.18 - when Sue suddenly randomly appears saying "can you be respectful to Jackie Weaver" 😅 made me laugh so much.
“YOU CANT DO THAT, IM IN CHARGE HERE JACKIE WEAVER”  “I AMMMM THE COUNCIL”- Jackie Weaver
I think the ‘ _Mrs Weaver PLEASE_ ’ at 3:45 has been somewhat overlooked in all this haha it’s too funny!
5:50 someone sounds like Gollum
7:12 What is that noise???
Hahaha this is pure gold
I'm totally on the side of Handforth PC Clerk. JW literally disrupted a meeting, decided on her own to kick people out, with NO AUTHORITY at all. She should've gone to jail.
What did they actually achieve in this meeting?
0:10
If there were no meetings in the last six months, then surely *nobody* has attended a meeting during that time, no?
This is in the league of Gilbert and Sullivan
I want to wish anyone in this ward my greatest sympathies if you have submitted a planning application 😂
Covid brought many treats, amateur zoom calls were one of them.
I was on a body corporate for an apartment building a number of years ago. Just a shitshow of boomers all having a winge at each other. I always said someone could turn this shit into a tv show.
I wonder how the wars coming along?
Who actually said f&&k off 10 secs in? Been on my head for years
I TAKE CHARGE READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM
Total and utter corruption
What you don't see is that Barry Burkhill was racking up the Pablo Escobars while his back was turned.
Julie i pad: *gasps*
15:34 "Well that was funny.... gotta dip"
Watching a democratic coup and the downfall of a brewing dictator in real time small town somewhere in little England x
😂😂😂😂 i love this
Here in the middle of 2025 and this gem is still one of the best things that came out of that horrible period of 2020
5:46 is the funniest thing I’ve ever heard 😂 I’m howling
I'm in charge. That voice is movie worthy.
0:10 the best part of the meeting 😂
Aled turning into Gollum because people weren’t listening to him is a whole mood.
I absolutely love it when the guy on Aled’s IPad turns in Gollum 05:48 and then the other guy starts manically laughing
I wonder if Vic and Bob are aware of this Handforth Parish Council Meeting?
I always come back to this masterpiece. Not even Monty Python could have written this! 😂😂
Who has no authority? No authority, at all?
Darkest timeline where Aled takes charge as the Vice Chair.
The chair seems quite knowledgable and competent to be fair.
“We’re trying to have a teams meeting you fool”
Like Fawlty Towers or Only Fools and Horses, I could never tire of watching this.
Aled Brewerton's dad is the ultimate agent of chaos here.
This still meets me laugh.
1:30
So many people with fuck all to do acting like jobsworths over nothing lol
There should be a reunion of sorts of the surviving members
Imagine them all just walking past each other in the supermarket... "Hi Jackie, you alright love?" "Yalreet Aled? Yeah, can't complain!"
Underrated moment is that Jackie Weaver has a Shonen Anime type power increase after turning on her camera
5:50 Where Handforth PC's newest member - Gollum - enters the fray
we may laugh at this but it's serious and shows who is representing us at a local level. It doesn't look good
5:45 Smeagol and Gollum debating over leaving the meeting because Barry got kicked out
We either unite against Jackie weaver, or we perish.
Julie’s IPad 😂
Here comes the subpoena 😂
Smeagol: "She's kicked Barry out so I'm leaving, no, Barry has gone"    Gollum: "c̶̺̳̏h̸͍̯̀ī̷͚̉͗c̶͔̬̪̈́ĥ̸̠̥͙͊͑û̴̡͓͓c̸̜̜̳̿̕ĥ̷̠͓̕i̴͕̩͂͝c̶̮͎̤̐c̸̢̨̨̢͖̻̻̻̦̟̉̀̀̈̑c̷̨̡̣̐̊̈͑f̴̨̜͇͕͔͇͚̣̤̓d̷͍̮̱̮̓̋͆͌͑̕͠͝j̸͕̊͋̌͌͒̕͝d̴̨̜̜̒k̷̬̳̖͔̟͈̖̲͒̀̅̎̄̀̓̋̾͑s̴̛̗̣̦̪̲̬͎͆̃̏̈ͅk̴̦̜͔̳͖͈̖̝͔̜͖̟̙͎͙̤̦̋͂͋͆̏͒̅̅̍́̅̚͝f̶̨̙̦̼̯͍͙͖̌̿̏̉̌͊́̄̑̂͗͐̽͗́͘ͅḓ̵̨̡̪̭͍̝̣̪̜̾̓͆̋̽̒̈́́̓̆̍͗̅̕̚͠j̶͇̤̜̤̩̖̬̙͎́̈̌f̶̨̡̡͔͙̱͉̗͇͙̰͉̱͇̐̽͜"    Smeagol: "We're trying to have a teams meeting you fool... we're trying to have a teams meeting you fool!"  Gollum: "We can't if you g̶̭̏́o̷̼̥̘͌ṫ̶͓̒̓ ̷̺̹̾t̵̩̅͗ḣ̸̙͓͖͑̔a̵̢͖̽̉̓ͅt̴̨͓́͠"
why does someone summon gollum at 5:48
Old but gold 😂😂😂
Still hilarious  😂
Illustration of how boomers destroyed everything
Honestly, it was like watching old friends. This was the only highlight of Covid
How do we only ever get the shortened version, the gold of "we're trying to have a teams meeting you fool" 😂 absolutely kills me
My favorite part is that after all this time is that Jackie Weaver was found to, in fact, NOT have the authority to remove councillors from the meeting!   Maybe she should have read the standing orders, and perhaps understood them!
Better than big brother 😂
5:48 why was Smeagol from lord of the rings in the meeting?
"The chairman of the council is  the chairman of...the....council"  😂
Unfortunately this behaviour still exists https://youtu.be/-Rqqwz-Ju1k?si=W1Upk52GQEaGaKyw
Those Word Art titles are too flashy! It really should have those old holly borders we used to make in Word to make Christmas menus
6:56 you better pop off Mr Quite Rightly 👏🏽👏🏽🔥🔥
So the Chairman and Vice Chairman were being investigated for improper conduct? Was that why Jackie Weaver was there?
Came back to see this gem again in January 2025. Never gets old.
To this day, I still say “you have no authority” and “READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!” on Zoom calls. Truly an evergreen meme 😂😂😂
Sue as the arbiter of peace proposes a treaty of clemency for those who were disruptive.
"In parish town councils the proper officer is USUALLY the clerk."
The whispers at 5:50 are giving the way wizards talk in Harry Potter when they're talking about something controversial-
The chairman of the council is the chairman of the.....council
0:46 The fact that previous times he or others were kicked out tells me this isn’t even the first time they’ve all duked it out like this.
😅 5:20  When a woman asked the men to be respectful of Jackie weaver and they all laugh histerically. 😅Respecting women isn't a thing they do huh?
lol I love this…
Quite rightly! !
Boomers boomering
Happy 4 year anniversary everyone
Utter idiots
Go on Alfred 😂😂😂
Clown car
Every second of this is gold: technology struggles; people getting kicked out; wildly disportionate anger;  phone call interruptions;  random toilet flushing sounds; whispered obscenities; awkward silences; arguing about whether the meeting has even started; debating whether someone can have a badge that says 'clerk' etc. Just fantastic, organic comedy.
Roger Small entering the scene like Darth Vader in Empire after his helmet has been lowered on.
"I'm gonna subpoena the lot of you's!" - Aled Brewerton "Here come the subpoena!"  "I'm gonna subpoena everyone!"  Aled is out of control here!!
3:27 is where the video starts
The way Aled speaks to his Father is disgusting.
The beginning feels like a movie switching between credits and shots of different actors.
This is gold
Jaa-key weevah
9:34 Jackie knew she ate that 😭
14:44 john smith is so unserious 😭😭
READTHEMANDUNDERSTSNDTHEM! - dumbledoor said quietly
Absolutely brilliant. British conflict at its finest.
"READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!!!!" 😂 man I'm crying why was he so aggressive
I swear, no other video has ever brought me so much joy.
its obviously whacky and hilarious to watch but these ridiculous geriatrics are to some degree, calling the shots up and down the country. frightening.
5:48 gradually becomes smegal from lord lf the rings.
1:30 - 2:15  the Chairman fabricates the role of 'Proper Officer'
honestly with all the context ive found handforth PC clerk is the real palpatine  only he actually gets killed by the jedi
5:48 mans turned into a rabid chihuahua for a second there
16:12 David Pincombe is the most underrated character in the whole ordeal. He predicts the meeting's virality almost 2 months before it actually happens
Jackie Weaver is a total dictator
8:00 I know this guy took out his phone and took a picture of the computer screen instead of screenshot
The barbary from the old chap at 2:16 will never fail to shock me
John Smith is a coward, he back tracked very quickly
5:48 Gollum shows up and speaks to Aled Jr
READ THE STANDING ORDERSS
WILL YOU STOP TALKING?!?!
I tehk chyyyyyarge.
What do they think they're achieving? Is this publicly funded?
This is my go to laugh video (2024)
The second “we’re trying to have a teams meeting you fool” is one of the funniest lines
My favourite parts come from the off screan digs. Not so much the ones who appear on screen.   Except for the Vice Chair!
What was all that about at 5.50? Sounded like something from middle earth
can this cast pls play mario cart?
what is this?? it was hilarious
What a bunch of busy bodies - wasters
Why don’t old people understand the mute button? It’s such an easy thing to understand. I actually think that zoom should introduce a function, where you have to hold down a button to talk and when you let go you’re automatically muted.   It might remind old people of walkie talkies.
This is why the UK is done for
7:08 - Gotcher "official reply" right here. 😄
All local government meetings worldwide should be mandated to be broadcast live online. Would keep these pompous prigs honest.😅
Love the constant smoke alarm chirping from Handforth PC Clerks' room
Peak covid content
i like how jackie weaver is almost always referred to as her full name
I never noticed the swearing first time round 🤣. It still raises my blood pressure just listening to this petty crap!
i reckon i'm responsible for at least 10% of these views
This committee does not decide anything. At one level it’s hilarious but it’s also depressing
I just come here for the "fuck off" at the start. Always makes my day! That and Julie's iPad.
11:09 It’s time to face the chaser
This is better than the US presidential debate 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sue is my favorite. Every time she comes in as a total jumpscare with complete knowledge of what she wants.
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!!! 😂😂😂😂
This is a perfect example of why human rulers will never sort out the world problems lol
Never in human history has so much time been wasted talking such little sense by so many
Jackie Weaver was this 🤏 close to making herself the new chairman, and then using that newly gained power to replace King Charles and then subsequently conquering the entirety of Europe
Had no idea that last of the summer wine and in the thick of it had a collab project together :O
This is 97% the same as any forum argument between moderators.  As above, so below.
Alot of people laugh at how petty it maybe, but severals laws were broken here
I think this got most people through Covid
"Read the standing orders! Read them and understand them!" 😅
5:50 my vote is for Smeagol for chairman
4:15 ILLEGALLY 🗣️
This is hilarious 😂
Well done Sir Ben Kingsley as the gormless, obnoxious and deeply agrresive Aled Brewerton. The Oscar's on it's way!😅
Jackie has been annoying since elementary school, we all know one
my mate just said the PC clerk sounds like winnie the pooh
"We're trying to have a team's meeting, you FOOL" - Dennis Reynolds energy exuding off this man
This will continue to be some of my favourite and proudest content ever produced by humanity and my country, lmao!
"The chairman of the council is the chairman of the council"   Incredible.
“ MrsWeaver, please”
Jackie Weaver is power hungry. 25 years as a glorified secretary and she thinks she is justified to maneuver around procedures. smh
I hate Jackie Weaver.....
Quite rightly! - Peter Moore's full contribution to society.
Peter the guitar guy is my favorite: Very few words, but strong words
God I despise Jackie Weaver so much
i love John smith
Comedy gold
17:00 the worst idea ever lol
why cant the english speak english......so much waffle.....what exactly was this meeting about
4:18 *_"I'm_*_ here and _*_I_*_ take charge!"_ Mate, you can't even take charge of your own iPad 😂
This is so much better than the edited down version
And why can't the world know WHY GENX can't be f'd with....?!?!   DID YOU SEE THE MENTAL GYMNASTICS WE HAD TO LIVE WITH AS PARENTS, TEACHERS, ADULTS predecessors we had to contend with???!?!
Peter Moore is my spiritual animal.
One might be happy to learn that Roger Small and Peter Moore are now members of Handforth Parish Council, along with John and Julie Smith, Susan Moore, Cynthia Samson, and others not featured in this video.  Very sadly, Barry Burkhill passed away in November 2022.  As for Brian Tolver and Aled Brewerton, the latter of whom comes off by far the worst of the entire video, I don't know.  Mr Brewerton, and his father Keith, say that their lives have become "hell" since the meeting went viral. I would suggest that they could have avoided such repercussions had their behaviour been better.  I always wonder who Aled Brewerton was speaking to when he so emphatically said "we're trying to have a Teams meeting you fool! I can't, have you got that?!" His wife or his child?
It had to be the dude with the guitars that told the chairman to eff off at the start he had a real axe to grind
Between this and the "I'm not a cat" video, I get a weird sense of nostalgia. Even though it's only been 3 years.
Subcommittee of the Yes
5:48 bro I’m dying man fuckin turned into gollum 💀💀💀😭😭
I've interacted with groups of this sort (counsels, churches etc.) a fair bit, and it never ceases to surprise me how useless and childlike a lot of them are. They spend the majority of their time discussing pointless trivialities or gossiping e.g. 'Should we call it the "environment committee" or the "conservation committee"? Should we have a vote? Oh actually we should really let the community have a say in the naming, so we'll need someone to make some flyers. Should we let them provide their own alternative or just give them a selection from names we have chose in advance? Did we ever decide a formal colour palette for the counsel? We should make sure that everything we do from now abides by those colour choices, so that means these leaflets will have to have the same colour scheme. Well, I certainly don't think we'll have time to finalize this today! So we'll need to create a timetable before we can officially create the group and start working on...' Part of growing up for me was realizing just how bad a lot of organizations (and the "adults" they are comprised of) are, and how much of a miracle it is that anything gets done. I'm certain that - whilst a lot of it is pure incompetence - some of it is intentional. People will create extra work and obtuse systems so that they can ensure the safety of their job. as well as have an advantage over new people so that they can more easily (and legally!) harass people that they don't like. The "even though no meetings were held, they still missed too many meetings and were thus ejected from the group" is a perfect example of what I'm talking about.
A bunch of elderly people who take themselves far too seriously, bickering over pointless titles, rules and privileges. What a waste of time.
I must know the basic lore?
A little over three years on, and I still love this.  So many great quotes and moments.  I hope all these folks are well
14:30 "For... political gain" _ERRRRRRRRRRRRGHCH_
Just like a cartoon, its brilliant! "We're trying to have a teams meeting, you fool!"
Literally nothing happens in Handforth, this is the most exciting thing to come out of that place for decades
Aled's iPad is just trolling the whole meeting
Jackie Weaver was wrong! READ THE STANDING ORDERS. READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!
"One councillor missed the past four meetings of the HPC. The fact that no meetings were held is irrelevant." Pure Kafka.
As someone who chairs meetings from time to time I have to say this is absolute unbridled chaos and I have no idea how Britain gets anything done.😂😂
this genuinely makes me so proud to be english. half of these people are carbon copies of my older relatives. this is the best piece of media to come out of england. james bond who? names weaver. jackie weaver.
Incredible. A couple of things that remain a mystery:  5:24 John Smith laughs and then Aled's father laughs hard. What is John laughing at here? It almost feels like Aled's dad is laughing with John, when i thought John was on Jackie's side.  5:49 Does Aled actually have some kind of personality disorder? From 5:51 onwards Aled gets very aggressive and i can't tell if he's being aggressive to his dad or to someone else in the room.  "we're trying to have a teams/change meeting you fool! I can't! Have you got that?"  Who is he saying "you fool" too?
Imagine aliens finding this gem as a video transmission...
16:12 David Pincombe predicting the future 😆
Just noticed one of them is called Roger Small 😂
I think someone needs to turn this into a game of dungeons and dragons
“You have no athority here Jackie weaver”. “No authority at all!”Then she promptly cans his ass 😅
10:52 wait, she has a problem with someone laughing but not with Gollum ranting right beside him!?
Boomers gonna boom
"I am gonna subpoena everybody" such an underrated moment
Aled was so outraged he turned into golem @12:20
A bit arrogant from Peter Moore on 00:52 there, and sits back with a smug and supercilious grin on his face.
What a bunch of losers
4:24 when you have to read and accept terms and conditions of products
You can't pay Jackie Weaver enough for dealing with all this lol.
That fuck off has me in hysterics every time.
I've had the phrase "what are you talking about, you don't know what you are talking about" in my head for the last 6 months and I couldn't remember where it was from.  Thank you algorithm. Mystery solved.
Jackie acted unlawfully here and she's really quite obnoxious.
Jackie seems ok
''It's not going to be finished this side of Christmas'' 💔
''READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!!''
This has the same energy as kindergarten kids making up a game with rules then proceeding to argue intensely over those rules.
7:12 thank you rodger *shits entire fucking Bowles out*
This is my Roman Empire
"Will you stop being whatever it is that you're trying to be" is actually a low key good insult. I'm gonna save that one.
I have immense pride in the fact that I probably live about 10 minutes away from anyone in this call. I hope one day to have the pleasure of seeing any of them in the wild.
Elizabeth Swan: This is madness  Captain Jack Sparrow: This is politics
Can someone please explain 5:49 to me please? Genuinely mental behaviour 😂
WHATS WITH THE GOLLUM IMPRESSION??????????
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!!!!
RIP Brian and Barry Now Peter and Roger are councillors.
I love how Roger turns around in the beginning like he's in a Lin Manuel Miranda production
10 seconds in 😂😂😂😂
This makes me think British comedy shows aren't actually comedy shows, they're just accurate depictions of life in Britain.
Nothing better than letting old farts decide our future. Great age is associated with wisdom. Even greater age is associated with geriatrics that have declining cognitive abilities.
Coming back to this masterpiece for the laughs. I hope this is being adapted for TV or film, this is my dream cast: Emma Thompson as Jackie Weaver; Brendan Gleeson as Handforth Clerk PC aka the chairman; Colin Farrell as young angry dude in Aled's ipad; Daniel Craig as older sassy dude from Aled's ipad; Ewan McGregor as John Smith; Imelda Staunton as Cyn; Mark Strong as Peter Moore; Jim Broadbent as Ian Ball; Joan Plowright as Sue; Hugh Grant as Allan.
I wish we had more backstory on the guy who said Quite Rightly. He seemed agitated but also said "I agree" in the most gentlemanly, posh way imagineable.
😂😂😂😂😂
It's like an episode of BBC's Staged, but for geriatrics!
*we’re trying to have a teams meetin u fool*
All i heard was "fuck off"  and "erm".
This is still very funny. But also, it's terrifying how cruel and demanding these men were. They had such distain for all of the women. The most telling part is the tention high point where the man screamed at her to read the rules and understand that she didn't have a voice, he is the co chairman and demanded to be the only voice that matters. Gd evil. Can we talk about abuse, power struggles and control?
'' Councillor didnt attend any meetings for 6 months , the fact there was no meetings is irrelevant ''
Coffin ⚰️ Dodgers
Does Roger Small realise how epic his entrance was? That was like something from a Hollywood film lol...
Everything Peter Moore did was two feet through a window on the end of a rappel rope
5:48 👹
"The fact that there were no meetings held is irrelevant"  Wait what?
5:45 going full Golem is the gift that still gives even now
I've seen more composed meetings from primary school student councils
Videos of the conduct of town councils has only reinforced my belief for the need for a well armed populace.
you don't know what your talking about. 'the chair men of the conucil is the... umm... errhh.. the irony
May I just ask people from now on to be respectful about Barry Burkhill, he passed away in November 2022. Since he is no longer with us to defend himself, it would be wrong to continue to attack his name. It's best to respect those who passed, these few minutes were what we saw of Mr Burkhill, yet are we going to judge his entire life over 18 minutes? Barry Bukrhill left a good and generous life and will hopefully rest in peace forever on. RIP Barry Burkhill.
I find this so so funny 😂
I imagine that this is what Oblivion NPCs sound like in the Wreck it Ralph universe
That's hilarious!!!!!!
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!!! hahahahah
I LOVE this video so much
The f**k off at the start is so underrated!! Lol it set the tone for the whole thing 😂
Did someone say f... off at the beginning
Jacqueline Weaver is a saint
THIS WAS SUCH A ROLLER COASTER I SAT IN SUSPENSE THE WHOLE TIME
"the chairman of the council is the chairman of the council"
Councillor Burkhill with his back to the camera like the end of The Blair Witch Project 🤣
I feel second hand embarassment for europeans lol..
Jackie Weaver was completely out of order in virtually everything she did. She had no right to remove anyone from the meeting. Only the Chair can do that after a vote by members. She was not the Proper Officer, so could not speak without the permission of the Chair. If the Chair is not present, the vice-Chair automatically takes over. A councillor can act as clerk but cannot accept payment for that role. All decisions made at this meeting were invalid and illegal as a result of her actions. I say this as an extremely experienced Parish and City councillor (not in Cheshire).
Is that gollum 5:56?
Best video of all time
I’d like to know where the first meeting is? Why was he thrown out ?!
Roy Cropper has aged well
I couldn't believe my ears when I heard Ian Ball say that "Handforth PC Clerk" was not, in fact, the TRUE clerk of the parish council And the fact that he sent an email telling everyone that he had taken over as the clerk of the council A true modern tyrant
The way the man talks about himself as the chairman in 3rd person 🤣🤣🤣 I love all of these humans
Were trying to have a teams meeting you fool
They honestly think they are roman senators. Was waiting for the word VETO
Jackie’s out of line she has no authority.
That Cyn could have been thrown out as well
This is crazy
Let men have squares forest,  Let women have squares forest,  The results was clearly said whos better built a city
This is so messed up. Idk if tax payers fund religious organizations in the UK, but if so this is really just messed up
5:50 Gollum, my precious 😂😂😂😂
Was that Gollum at 5:57?
Ian Ball trying to explain the Zoom name is gold
"The man is a complete disgrace" "Yes thank you Peter"
Dammit, is it satire? Ca't tell
“WE’RE TRYING TO HAVE A TEAMS MEETING YOU FOOL!!!!”
"I think it would be very easy to alter the constitution, no problem at all."  Oh, would it that life were that simple.     I look forward to the meeting of the sub committee of the steering group.     Love Councils - one of the many  things that makes Britain great.
lol
Here comes the subpoena! 😂
kafkaesque
Like gandolph in the bridge " u have no authority here Jackie weaver". 🤣
I am fuqin in love w thse people. 💖 "🤬READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM" Bwuahahaaa
The fuck off in the beginning was personal
Here comes the Subpoena!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I started doing my ancestral tree recently and found out that my 6x great grandfather, a Quaker who immigrated to Pennsylvania around 1700, was born in Handforth. I instantly thought of this meeting
We're laughing about all of this but the reality is that this inability to keep emotions aside and acting childish and unprofessional in a council meeting is a problem that takes place on a cultural level and that's worrying.
Jesus, are these just wannabe politicians?
What is that Cyn thing🤣 6:18 good response 🤣
These old woman are a bunch of commoners🤦‍♂️🤣
3:03 common woman answering the phone in a meeting 🤦‍♂️
You’re thick if you’re on Jackie Weavers side
4:18 The way he says "I take charge" sounds like it was taken right out of Game of Thrones
3:23 most underrated moment
Imagine being the minute taker for this meeting.....:(
I love how Barry waits until Brian and Aled have caused a fuss before kicking off. Just like he did in the previous meeting.
If your grown ass can act right you can get out of the corner hahahaha
Handforth clearly has some solid characters on their Parish Council.
the only reason cyn is there is to be a menace
Jackie is drunk with power on the ban hammer.
I think that sound at 7:12 sounded a little like a toilet flushing.
Jackie Weaver is a usurper and a tyrant.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This has all the building blocks of a great csgo team
I’ve lost count of the factions in one room let alone Zoom… haha! Dear oh dear! Good for Jackie holding her nerve 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
16:09 Ian Ball
as soon as the three troublemakers had been "released" of their duties, the rest of the meeting shines aa an example of kindness and relaxed professionalism.
The people of Handforth must be very confident that the important decisions of the community are in the hands of this committee.
This is the old person equivalent of internet moderators
Netflix: If you want me back, GREENLIGHT THIS!!
5:48 jesus that scared the crap out of me!!! Is that a demon talking??
huh?
5:51 we’re trying to have a teams meeting you fool
At an employment committee meeting held on 4 November 2020, three councillors – Brian Tolver, Aled Brewerton and Barry Burkhill – tried to suspend the clerk Ashley Comiskey Dawson.[18]  On Cheshire East Council (CEC), Burkhill faced a vote of no confidence from Conservative councillor Liz Wardlaw for his "complicity in the bullying" of Jackie Weaver – coordinator of a council Zoom call meeting – and for bringing "this council and his role within this council into disrepute".[19] The motion was referred to the council’s standard committee and was not debated at the full council meeting in February.[20] Burkhill quit the parish council in May 2021 saying, "I have decided to concentrate on my Handforth Ratepayer Independent role at CEC, as too much of my time has been taken up in trying to deal with HPC's enduring problems."[21]  In April 2021, chair Brian Tolver and vice-chair Aled Brewerton both announced they would be stepping down from the parish council. Their resignations were believed to have been in response to the reaction of the now viral Zoom meeting.[22][23]  Brian Tolver only resigned as chair, not as councillor in the April meeting, whereas Brewerton resigned from both.[21]
Our planet is fucked if we have people like this
15:20 he low key sounds like Winnie the pooh
Jokes aside, this is a sad way to spend your last years. You should retire and enjoy yourself instead of clinging on to "authority." The fact that the technology exists to call "illegal" meetings and kick you out "illegally" no matter the rank should tell you how imaginary your position actually is.
I love how we’re all just referring to “Jackie Weaver” in full every time lmao it makes me think we’re talking about the actress😂😂
redcoat
It's 7 let's start the meeting Oh no I've got two minutes till, Oh dear that won't do I've got 2 minutes after. 🤣Boomers
I laughed so hard I needed to take a break
What is this lmfao this is so surreal
Scousers don’t get knocked out
What’s this meeting even about? It seems like the old folk just formed a group just to bicker over things that don’t even matter. Old folk be WIL’IN!!
Jackie weaver "Um, um, um, um, um, um"....Just be quiet instead of saying um all the fucking time 🤨
...and the environs
This is comedy gold
Jackie is just violent. She just removed the chairman then denounced his existence. Truly a powerful woman
Boomers always gonna boom
I just found out about all of this today and I'm obsessed. I want to move to the UK immediately.
Your taxes pay for this Britain lol
"This is madness"  "This is politics"
While I don’t agree with the hardforth pc clerk, I will say that Jackie weaver seems like a bit of a b
I wonder why the hardforth pc clerk was kicked out of the last meeting
I enjoy their hate towards each other
I love how it starts with someone asking a question and being told to f**k off. That’s such a perfect sign of what’s to come
you have no power here jackie weaver!
Ian ball is a snitch
my heart hurts from laughing
I think I understand now why the UK is in the shitter.
Alan’s iPad
This is the most insane thing I have ever seen and I understood nothing that was going on. Excellent video.
Ah fuck I’ve known people from my work union who are exactly like this chairman guy, completely obnoxious rules lawyer-ing for the sake of their own ego and power trip especially if it prevents anything productive from being done.
*I can't believe it's just a bashing memory*
Is this real?
5:48 Golem wants his Precious.
turf war breaking out hahaha
at first i thought jackie weaver was a little boy doing a fake british accent
it does feel like jakie weaver is in the wrong here? tho i cant really blame her when she had to setup the meeting couse the other people are just to lazy to do it themself.
i love how that one guy just turn around to the camera in such a cinematic way lol
5:48 did he become a demon?
surprised aled's ipad didnt challenge jackie weaver to a duel
We’re trying to have a teams meeting you fool
Oh so she wasnt actually a member of the council? Spicy.
5:48 Didn’t know Gollum attends these meetings. Lost his precious mind.
This is why you don't let boomers use modern technology.
Fans of this meeting should work my job.  I do transcriptions for court proceedings from Magistrates to the Court of Appeals, along with occasional private commissions like owner's corp meetings.  Lots of crazy shouting people and Zoom confusion.
What in God's Name is happening 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 here  So much drama  Good lord 😂😂😂😂😂😂 The lazy use of Zoom meeting is an absolute delight to watch 😂😂😂
Very similar to Poppleton Parish Council in York
Lol some of the most immature people I've ever heard
Lol Man speaks without stopping once, Jackie responds. WILL YOU PLEASE LET ME SPEAK! I swear, this guy is every single customer in the UK. Honestly, will call you to explain how your job works then refuse to stfu long enough to see if they're correct lol
Remove Jackie Weaver
Evil sounds.
David Pincombe just predicted this entire event
jackie weaver banishing another council member in the first five minutes really sets the scene
Underrated, but I love the variety of accents.
The two things that really get me: 1. They’re blocked from accessing their own website for unexplained reasons 2. Councilor Ashley didn’t attend a meeting for six months, but “the fact that no meetings took place is irrelevant” how’s he supposed to attend a meeting that isn’t happening
"Once you've stopped being, whatever it is you're trying to be" Is still one of my favourite insults of all time.
The Chairman sounds like a David Attenborough/ Alan Titchmarsh hybrid
My lockdown would have been enjoyable had I seen this video when it was uploaded. Great stuff
Why they didn’t turned this into a musical already
As soon as the chairman was removed the meeting was voided
The epic entrance of Roger Small with the perfect cut is criminally underrated.
"The man is a disgrace"  "Thank you peter"
I would watch a full multi-season comedy show about a parish council like this one
BBC  should jump on this and buy the rights to air these meetings, I’d love to see these people go at it in a real meeting, it’s comedy gold
some of these guys will be on I'm a celebrity get me out of here
This is what happens when you give women power.
How the hell did the chairman get his position if everyone hates him and keeps being disruptive lol
what did john smith say at 5:22
Peter Moore is guitar boomer
Delicious
Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on 😂 Jackie is a joker
Aled Brewerton's mum when was trying to feed him as a baby:  Open wide! Here comes the subpoena!!!
Barry has no fucking clue what's happening
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!!
I now sexually identify as clark
"The chairman of the council, is the, er, the chairman of the... er...     council."
There is no difference between clerking and proper officer
Aled is so freaking awesome.
#StopBanningBarry
“Quite rightly”??? 😂😂 who ever said that must be tapping Jackie, while showing off his guitars
Take a shot everytime Jackie Weaver says um. You'll be dead by the end of the video. It seems she does hold some power here.
You see, the English argue, us Americans shoot and loot, it’s the natural evolution
Did they actually get anywhere with this meeting😂
PC Clerk is such a shit stirrer I love it😂
oh power, and how it goes to one's head 🤣
This is a work of art. All of it. 3:26
aled wanted all the smoke
This wasn't written, this was real life, I really do
*Isolate Handforth pc clerk audio *add eerie soundtrack *change Jackie weaver to Hubert cumberdale 😌
Heald Green represent !
Who did "fuck off"?
jackie weaver acting the bollox
"What are you gonna do, remove me?" - quote from man that was removed
The local County Council (Cheshire) wasted 85,000 GBP on a subsequent enquiry  to decide that Julie  didn't have the "power". Which only goes to show the utter waste of public money by local authorities.
I've been laughing so hard I had to stop the video 3x. 🤣 I think we need to start an exchange of silly town/council Zoom calls from around the world. This is how we'll cross cultural lines and strengthen the bonds of our shared humanity - by seeing how petty people of all stripes can be on minor municipal matters.
How these people ruled the world I have no idea
I like how the Clerk asks if he won't be kicked out of the meeting like last time. Which he doesn't understand that because he's using the free version of zoom he gets kicked out after 60 minutes.
5:49 Does anyone speak Parseltongue well enough to translate?
These people are from another fucking world
the old geezer next to Aled who starts laughing at the screen is the best bit for me, just before he says the immortal line `Coming from you from Birkenhead, that sounds good!' Comedy gold.
I hate Jackie weaver now haha
This is 2021 version of "why are you gae?"
I just watched people on their deathbeds argue about the most pointless shit
um um um um um um um um um
0.09 Im still laughing
This so much like the "Vicar of Dibley" council
When do we plan to start   0.12 ‘fuck off’
what the fuck is going on i feel like i'm watching a weird dystopian sci-fi
I like to imagine this is some secret society of super-villains, trying and failing to work together in their evil plans.
I love how Roger Small turns round at the beginning like a Sith Lord
"Will you stop being whatever it is you're trying to be" Sartre would be proud of this. A clearer expression of the existentialist impetus against 'bad faith' it would be difficult to imagine. An objectionable councillor suddenly gets inadvertently philosophical in the midst of remonstrating with a parachuted-in facilitator.
old british people
Peter Moore is underrated
Handforth PC Clerk is like that one interesting character in any series that you begin to love and then gets killed off in the first episode. Would've loved to see more of him during the rest of the meeting
…if this goes viral.. (3.5m viewers later)
The law has been broken
Petty petty petty petty
Ι sincerely hope "Aled" never finds the mute button
1:30-1:32 is such an underrated moment
8:58 - a fantastic contribution by Mrs. Jackie "Um" Weaver
Is this what they call politics?
a true bastion of politics
This meeting is a fever dream
I have no idea what this is about, but it's funny 😂😂
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!!!!!
5:50
Not extordinary this is the same up and down the UK 😂
The comedic timing in this is beyond words.
loses it at 5:45 LOL
5:48 was that a chihuahua?
This is a stitch!
this is like something out of parks and recs man.
what is happening
who’s still watching in 2022? 🤪🤪
“When do we plan to start?”   …  “Fuck off”  😂😂
Aled in the background just saying he is gonna subpoenar everybody, followed by some laughter 5:13, amazing how many hidden details are in the writing, the scriptwriters were incredible
My favourite person there is aled senior, he is mad - this is one of the best videos i have ever seen
this is wonderful
this is wonderful
Jackie Weaver needs to learn her fuckin place if you ask me
They must be allergic to actually making progress
The kid's zoom meeting was more civilized than this one.
meetings characteristically cerise diagie Why is the audience f this ne exceed t an endless mange
I love that Smeagol and Golum seem to have joined the meeting at around 5:50. Also I think Julie's I Pad stole the show!
5:51
I’m personally team Chairman
Aw, poor Alan lol 🤣🤣
It's as if they think they're in a courtroom drama.
"Appalling behaviour." Words only said by teachers and Jackie.
5:48 This líne is just too much, feels like someone putting too much effort into a theatre show.
Clerk out here sounding like winnie the fucking pooh. Why nobody talking about this
I thought this was an old YouTube video from the late 2000s
mdr les vieux
The more I listen to "Handforth PC Clerk" the more he sounds like an angry Winnie the Pooh. I take my eyes off the screen and I picture it immediately
This is the definition of "Okay, Boomer."
This video radicalized me
and people ask me why I'm frenchphobic
this is like an always sunny skit
Barry Burkhill had a good point
This is the pinnacle of human collaboration
we're trying to have a team's meeting you fool
But what about the droid attack on the Wookiee’s
Pretty good showcase of why old people shouldn't be in charge in the modern day))
Epic
3:18 This is some Blair Witch stuff right there
Golem has left the chat.
What the hell did I just watch 😂😂🤣
WHY DO THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME THO
BOOMERS
"We dont want a turf war breaking out" holy shit guys lock up and brace yourselves for walking sticks
read the standing orders
these people will have a debate over a blade of fucking grass.
That first “Fuck Off” just sets the tone beautifully
David Pincombe literally foretold the future lmao
This is pretty similar to the trial of Charles I
"DEAR ME"
They playing D&D?
And they say it’s only American politicians that are like this 😂
Love how everyone refers to Jackie weaver by her full name Jackie weaver
jackie looks to have an Ashkenazi jew phenotype
Bethesda needs to take notes for any Oblivion Remasters they plan to make in 2069, this is a great example if an Oblivion NPC conversation
Ffs  FOOK THE SYSTEM
When do we plan to start? Fuck off
“WE’RE TRYING TO HAVE A TEAMS MEETING YOU FOOL!” 😂🤣😂🤣😂
I love how she heard the f**k off in the beginning and asked for mics to be muted , the laughing hyena comment and the fact that Aled literally sounded like Gollum.  As well as the the chair calling himself the clerk when he is not allowed hence the Britney Spears comment.
They get online and become robots.  “I find that the person on Aled’s zoom is being very disrespectful to everybody”   Like, can’t you just say “pack it in aled”
Was it just me or did anyone else find this boring as hell?
Is this game of thrones
“READ the standing orders and understand them.”   This man arrived violently.
There’s a guy called Ian ball no way
Brian Tolver is now my profile picture.
Me and my bestie theorise that Julie's "I Pad" isn't really and "iPad," but she wants people to think that it is lolol
PC Clerk sounds like Winnie The Pooh
Councillor Brewerton seems like a right prick. :)
aled’s gollum noises are killing me xddddddddd i can t
i really wanted more of Handforth PC Clerk Jackie has blood on her hands
My favorite part is Aled saying he’s going to subpoena everybody
Jackie's "umm" is an underrated character
Handforth lore is something else
Guitar Peter is full of anger 🥴
"We're trying to have a teams meeting you fool" in that voice 😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Chairman: You have no authority here, Jackie Weaver. You have no authority at all!   Jackie: or do I? 😏 *booted the Chairman’s ass
I wanna move to hanforth. Place is bonkers.
Love it when Aled turns into gollum.
Can someone explain wtf are they actually discussing??
It’s like the good old Xbox live days. 😂😂
Before this video went viral, I thought that “The Casual Vacancy” and “Hot Fuzz” were works of fiction. Now I’m not so sure….
If there’s a chairman, why was Jackie trying to take charge?
Brian Tolver: In the name of the Handforth Parish Council, you're under arrest councellor Jackie: Are you threatening me Master Chairman? Brian: The Council will decide your fate Jackie: I am the council... and Britney Spears Brian: Not yet Jackie: It's treason then...
We should delegate the management of the pandemic to these people. They clearly know what they are doing.
It makes me so sad that people like aled and the clark exist, like wtf
All it need is oblivion npc music and it's a masterpiece.
Some men just want to watch the parish burn.
It was the committee meeting we needed but not the one we deserved.
politics in the uk seem really funny, need to watch them more often
Was Jackie Weaver in the right, that's what I want to know.
More epic than Tuco's introduction in The Good The Bad The Ugly, or Orson Welles reveal in The Third Man - is Roger Small's turn to camera in the Handforth Parish Council meeting!
Who is actually in charge here?!
You have no authority here Jackie Weaver, no authority at all.
Roger Small could be a narrator
Bro the fucking half a second frame of Barry Burkhill sitting  quietly in his room, backwards to the camera makes me cry laughing
This is unfathomably funny
The dramatic body turn entrance at the beggining is perfect for this
I love it when people try enforce a hierarchy just for hierarchy's sake. Pure comedy gold.
Gollum guy is my favorite
What a comedy 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I can't stop watching this, It's a problem now lmao
idk how i got here but i am mindblown
0:05 Even that guy turning towards the camera is funny as hell
I love democracy.
....who actually is the chairman?
05:04 lol
Jackie is a quite peaceful Karen
4:22
The part after 4:00 makes me cry laughing everytime
I wish the prequel had been recorded, sounds pretty chaotic
Cyn can piss off
This always has me laughing from 8 seconds in. The way that chap turns around like a villain. It has me in hysterics hahaha
14:32 love it when Sue lets out a "BUUUGGGHHHHRRRRHHH" as if her soul is leaving her body
Jackie weaver and her feminist cabal breaking all the rules to make their hillary Clinton revenge fanfic a reality. Smh, sad
I love boomers.we need to protect them at all costs
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM
*This oozes boomer energy*
Ironically, Jackie Weaver's well on her way to being as famous as Britney Spears.
That's like Among us but for Old people
Ohh I turned 18 that day! Cool
You have no authority here Jackie Weaver
0:52
How have I now seen this until now??
When people said Gollum made an appearance I didn’t believe them. Then I heard it. It’s Gollum 100%. I can’t listen without crying 🤣
I’m gonna subpoena everybody. - The Bellend.
Why is nobody talking about Aled Jr getting shushed by his dad like a naughty toddler?
"If this goes viral on the internet or whatever, it's going to start a war of words" No it's just going to be laughed at because drama funny
I’m so happy I got recommended this 🤣🤣🤣
Vince Mcmahon, watching this with his personal assistants: 'Take notes, dammit!'
15:04 "I've never seen such a letter." "You've not been to Handforth often enough." The sort of thing you'd see at the end of a trailer to this.
Tag yourself I'm Julie's I pad
This meeting is really how the war of the roses started folks
I have many questions.   1. Why are there two people on Aled's ipad? I thought the younger fellow was the councilor. Did his senile old dad just hijack it?  2. 5:25 is the funniest shit in this whole thing to me. What are they laughing at? Just the way the old guy points and laugh cracks me up.  3. What in the fuck was 5:43 ?  4. What's the crazy laughing about at 6:00 ?  5. What in the actual fuck was going on on Aled's ipad?  6. 5:20 is she on the shitter?
All you old folks out there are you getting Vicar of Dibly vibes out there?
What’re you talkin’ abou- You don’t know what you’re talking about.
0:05 The name's Small.  Roger Small.
Jackie weaver: i love the parish, i love democracy. I promise to lay down my emergency powers when this crisis has been abated
16:26 - They're going to have a turf war!
"chairman- the chairman of the council is the- is the chairman of the- of the uhh council" 5:08
If they ever bring The Office UK back this should be the cast.
The extreme passive aggressiveness of this meeting is really why everybody is so attracted to this
Roger small spinning in has me in creases
I too am a fan of the Handforth Extended Universe
I like how the audio is total crap and practically every sentence anyone says is cut off, adding to the confusion.
“WILL YOU STOP TALKING?????”
This is why I would never join the parish council. What a waste of everyone's time.
Jackie Weaver, a tyrannical and ruthless ruler, rises to power through a coup d'etat in the peaceful realm of Handforth where she proceeds to unhesitatingly eliminate those who oppose her and wreak havoc as she desperately clings to the chair of power.
I love how they are so embarassed and even have awareness that this can get leaked, and asking for everyones agreement at the end that it does not get shared on social media?  It did get shared, i wonder who leaked this out ?
OMG new content, another council meeting going to chaos, this time in Essex England: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr5dKhwmlZU&ab_channel=TheTelegraph
Did Gollum invade Aled's Room? XD
It blows my fucking mind that people who are this childish hold any power.
If you close your eyes, it sounds like Whinny the Pooh addressing the other woodland friends in a condescending manner. Rabbit gets the phone call etc. etc.
julie's I Pad is my favorite
I love how Julie’s I pad’s only contributions to the meeting were two gasps, a leaked phone call and a toilet flush
the fuck off at the start is my favorite
I like the old guy who explained the point of order.  I’m on his side.
It’s Julie not giving a tiny rat’s ass by answering that call fully UNMUTED! Such a mood
Aled’s house needs an exorcist hahahahahahaha
Cam on ingurland!
this is actually the crispiest 240p I've ever seen
So who’s in the right, jackie or the man?
How did Pincombe know it was gonna go viral? 🤣
The devil came through in the sentence, "Read them and understand them"  lmao 🤣😂🤣😂
Never laughed so hard - this is my favourite thing in the world. I only wish my fellow Americans understood the rich humour inherent in every moment of this - comments included!
You cant make this shit up. If we didnt have zooms, this meeting would have been lost to time.
John is the ladies' men
The council of Malastare concurs with the honorable representatives of the trade federation. A comission must be made.
Love the closed captions at 5:50 🤣
How are these people so drunk on their minuscule council power it kills me
This has to be a really well acted skit , has to be  oh my lord
Nothing better to do haha
Jackie Weaver.... balls of steel
Roger Small's TURN when the meeting started is something I never thought I'd laugh this hard at.
Julies Ipad is such chaotic energy
5:48 someone’s   inner Gollum comes out
Cyn is a very "no" person, I'm not sure I like her energy.
Imagine what would happen if they were all in the same room. Yikes!
"When do we plan to start?"  .............."Fuck off"
"Read the standing orders... READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM"
These people can vote
Anyone else think Ian should have led with the email regarding Brian’s moniker of Clerk first?
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM
Jesus christ. Is this what people do after retirement?
Smallest amount of power to ever go over someone's head
I feel that Julie I pad dodged a bullet and also missed out at the same time…
Aled goes full Sméagol on the council
2:24 the Chairman was totally going to call Jackie a b***h 🤣
The FREAK with Aled is a SPAZ! Vote them out. Their “power” has gone to their heads.
Big question is... when is the next meeting?? 🤔
I imagine this is how Hobbits behave at farming guild meetings
most polite british person
This makes me feel better about America
Now this is reality TV
Politica be like
Gloriously amateur and chaotic 😂😂😂
...This is why I struggle to credit conspiracy theories involving secret organisations behind government. ...Because such theories presume there is organisation behind government.
“The chairman of the council is the chairman of the.. err.. council.”  Very well said. Can’t agree more. 👏🏻
" fuck off"  Ahahahahaaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
Julies iPad lol dodgy
Ah, 'soverignty'
17:02   "Can we make...this...recording available? Of th..the Zoom meeting?"  "I don't see why not, Chairman"  And history was made.
There's so many damn characters
Parish councils need to just go, waste of time. Comedy gold is one thing but most of these meetings aren't recorded. Either get the TV crews in there or get rid of them.
What just happened
Julie wrote her own name like that...
That villain laugh at 5:04💀
I still prefer this kind of chaos than Americans who need clap their hands with every word just to seem like they have a point. When they don’t.
Better than game of thrones
Does anyone know who is responsible for the breathy "fuck off" at the beginning of the video? I want to pat that man on the back
Jackie Weaver got butthurt by the no authority line 😂
5:30 "Here comes the subpoena! 😁" legendary
It shows what can happen when people get to much power, it can go right to their heads.
I would hate to see a "turf war break out" after this.
"In 25 years i have never seen such a strongly worded letter, i have never seen anything like it"
Feel sorry for Aled Sr having to try and restrain Aled Jr
David Pincombe and Sue are the most underrated characters, their role in the prequel really reinforces their role in the main saga
*Bane voice*: "Do you feel in charge?" 4:20 :
First
James Cromwell as Peter
Everybody has a plan until they enter a zoom parish council. Mike Tyson.
They can’t even get the meeting start...
Fuck the YouTube boxing matches, I wanna see Jackie fight the world
Standing orders are tantamount to the ten commandments to these people.
I love how they’re all besties with John Smith like he wasn’t cackling at them being dragged by Aled sr lmaooo
Chairman of the council is the chairman of the... of the... council
The country was in lockdown at that time. Which part of 'social distancing' didn't Tolver and his shouty mate understand?
Anybody/software retailers who think meetings can be held constructively on zoom or other clones of zoom can clearly see it is not possible, as all participants can not participate.
And they say Anarchists are chaotic. 😂
The way the names pop up on a black background cutting the video feels like the beginning of an indie movie with the credits lol
aled's ipad are my favorites
old white men talking down to & disrespecting the two old white women and fighting amongst themselves instead of focusing on serving their community
imagine being so far up your own ass
A great English Comedy
5:48 Did Aled just turn into Gollum?
All of them are like fudging zombies
Roger Small doing a Roger Moore 🤣
I love rodgers backward facing entrance at the start
Read the standing orders - READ THEM....lmao
You can't write this kind of comedy.
Can't wait for the sequel
Jackie weaver is Carole Baskin........hahaha
"You Foooool!"
"We don't want a turf war breaking out"
Let’s play ‘spot the Brexiteers’.
Jackie Weaver is a Queen
"When the chairman departed".....more like Jackie Weaver terminated him!! Lol
0:06 - Introducing Roger Small 0:09 - "Fuck off..." 1:30 - The chairman invents the role "Proper Officer" 2:14 - Jackie VS Chairman 3:02 - Julie's Ipad's legendary phone call 3:16 - Barry Burkhill's dramatic silent backwards facing entrance 3:35 - Jackie, now with webcam VS Chairman 3:57 - "You have no authority here Jackie Weaver" 4:16 - Read the Standing Orders! 4:57 - "Councillor Burkhill we've been through this"   5:19 - Sue enters Stage Left 5:48 - Aled Jnr is possessed 6:06 - Cyn voted to eject Aled Snr 6:54 - "The man is an complete disgrace" 7:11 - Someone flushes a toilet? 7:25 - Ian has the Receipts on the Chairman! 9:13 - "Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on"  9:46 - The vote to bring the Councillors back from the Naughty Step 10:48 - Cyn from Birkenhead calls out the laughing hyena 11:09 - Roger Small returns with a question for Jackie Weaver 13:32 - John Smith calls out Councillor Ashley 16:12 - David Pincombe predicts the future
This is just as glorious 6 months on!
“Point Of Order” the Roleplaying Game 2nd Edition
I LIVE 5 MINUTES AWAY FROM HANDFORTH WTF
these men come across as pathetic, childish, rude, incompetent, racist & prejudice... genuinely embarrassing on so many levels
Who’s here from Bradley Hall?😂😂😂
5:48 *A BLAZE IN THE NORTHERN SKY*
I like Peter
2:13 "WILL U STOP TALKING"  I've watched this too many times🤣
Jackie weaver was the prefect in school that would try to give you detentions
Honestly you can't script something like this. Fantastic
Btw these are the guys who are in charge  of the Christmas lights 😂 acting like it’s parliament
Jackie Weaver is the final Karen form. Who'd have thought
The way the older chap cracks up laughing at 6:06 after the poisoned dwarf has a benny and storms out of the room is priceless.
Cyn is a grass. worst person in this video by a mile
League Of Ungentlemen
Such a shame this couldn't come out at the cinema cause of the pandemic.
I nominate Frank Costanza as chairman.
How is this real lmaoo
5:56 is VERY Gollum
Best part was the guy (Aled?) doing a Gollum impression.
Just realised that there's a F*** OFF at the start 🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
I still don't know what they were all talking about but I love it
Never in the history of human conflict has so little been fought over so hard by so few.
Will you STOP-TALKING!!!
Clearly the only way for them to have productive meetings in future is for them all to be in the room together, with everyone armed with lethal weapons.
I'm sure I heard Gollum in there losing his sh!t. "We are trying to have a teams meeting you fool!" 🤣
The thing is Jackie Weaver had no right to kick out the fucking chair of the council smh
Jackie Weaver is drunk with power I find her incorrigible
Should be renamed the Battle of Handforth Parish Council Planning & Environment Committee
Sue's sigh at 14:32 is sumptuous
cyn's entire vocabulary: no, no, nono, no, no......
There is more internal conflict here than that  Prince Andrew interview
Can someone explain to me, an American, who is right and wrong in this ordeal? I ask this because it seems it should be abundantly obvious who is right and wrong in a situation such as this - but the truth is obfuscated to someone unaware of this particular type of governing body.
Turf war? WTF? 😂
Jackie is out of order though? 😂
It sounds like Jackie needs to step down just for trying to take control of the meeting
Sounds like Gollum at 5:50 and 5:57...
"What are YOU talking about?  You don't know what you're TALKING about! "
Aled is a psychopath
Jackie Weaver for Prime Minister
Get Armando Iannucci on this The Thick of It revival🤣
Average Minecraft server staff team.
“You must know the proper law” sets the tone!
This is the NWA from hot Fuzz😂
5:23 - 6:23 - my favourite
What are they even discussing? Is this why the council never gets things done? Also this vid and the comment section is everything and it has made my week
I think its fair to say they've got a few issues in Cheshire East!
Um
honestly Aled's iPad gives me life
Rodger small ? I thought it was John craven lol
Where’s the Chairman gone?
This would be even funnier if it had a baby filter on it..
a subcommittee OF the steering group??
I would like a celebrity-fronted table read of this for charity.
Had more drama in this meeting than most reality tv shows. When's episode 2👀?
5:47 When you are so mad that your morph in to Golem
As bary so graciously put it. The chairman of the council is the chairman of the... Council
BARRY BURKHILL WAS THE MAYOR!? Barry Burkhill has his own Wikipedia page - check it out! I found some pre-2020s lore on Wikipedia but haven't verified all the info.   Also, 'John Michael Smith' ran unopposed for an election, apparently. His name gets more British the more you research him.
This has the same vibe of an Inside #9 episode.
John Smith is absolutely relishing every moment of this 😂 5:06
“Who is Alan Murdoch please?”  “Yes please”
Dolores Jane Umbridge
This video basically sums up what is quickly becoming of Western society as a whole. A bunch of narcissists entrenched in bureaucracy and pettiness, sniping at each other and not giving anything resembling a fuck about the actual reason they exist in the first place.
“READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM”  “Dear me”
Julie’s I pad
John Smith is cute
what a complete cluster fuck
‘In 25 years I’ve never seen ANYTHING like it.” “You’ve not been to Handforth often enough...”
“When do we plan to start?” “Fuck off” 🤣🤣🤣
Here comes the Subpoena!
Who said “Fuck Off” 🤣🤣🤣
"You have no authority here Jackie Weaver. No authority at all"  "Shes kicked him out!" 😂
What an ass !!
Jackfrags brought me here.
The moment they laugh at each other is when the Devil has joined the conversation.
you must know the basic          l o r e
Why are some English people so miserable and unhappy ?
Put your HAND FORTH and bring it back again.   And repeat vigorously. Then you will fit in on this PC.
By what authority does Jackie Weaver remove people from the meeting?
The chairman is a bellend. Thinks he is in the houses of parliament ffs.
Iv watched for 10 minutes and still have no idea what they are discussing or arguing about
None of these people are fit to sit on a council. A load of childish nonsense.
This is comedy gold brilliant
Alan's definitley the Handforth council heartthrob ,the sexual tension between him and Sue is seismic
The comedy timing of Jackie Weaver  is second to none ,"you have no authority here Jackie Weaver " .........shes kicked him out
John smith for P.M
It’s like watching spitting image
Handforth PC Clerk is such a villain
Can I be assured that I won't be kicked out of the comments section please?
Best episode of Midsomer nights ever.
grant Jackie weaver emergency power the build a clone army
This is the reason why the council and other public organisations are in such a mess.  Foolish people ruling, while doing frig-all to sort out real problems.  Typical council meeting, just happened to be captured on social media.
@7:10 that toilet flush 🤣🤣
@9:40 “Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on!” Hahaha
Good old Barry facing the wrong way at 3:16
There was nothing discussed that matters to the town people in the entire meeting. All pettiness and procedures - zero substance.
Thanks, England. We needed that! Love from the US, AKA "the other hot mess." 🤣😂🤣😂
The levels of intellect in this video are astounding. The full spectrum. Simple things such as peoples names as 'iPad' literally help no one.
Aled is an agent of chaos
This is like the watch in hot fuzz
Brian is such a rheumy eyed rascal. Hope he gets his own show.
Non of them have any authority! They’re all self appointed busybodies with nothing better to do ☺️
This is why parish council planning and environment departments never get anything done unless it's for themselves!
So is there a difference between clerk and proper officer? I need to know.
My mums in the parish council a few towns over, I honestly thought ours was juicy 😭😂
Can you imagine being a neighbour  to any of these little englanders ?
11:17 my man be looking like Chevy Chase
Did this meeting agree/resolve anything apart from arranging the date of the next meeting?
0:51 lol he gives he vibes of when the kid told the teacher "good" on that'll teach em.  https://youtu.be/jNBchmFN-GA here's a link if you don't know it
Garish pouncil 😂
Haha omg I love it. Please more!!! Hahahaaaaa
This is why old people shouldn’t be running anything
Who flushed the toilet at 7:12? 😂
Never has such a dramatic coup against a democratically elected chairman been so vividly recorded.
No authority what a cock
vice chairs here...I TAKE CHARGE
4.20 I take charge !!!!
These people make me sick..
were trying to have a teams meeting you fool
Weaver is a bit of a little Hitler at some points! Aled is nuts!
*_YOU HAVE NO POWER HERE, JACKIE WEAVER!!!_*
Bad language = block 🚷 💅
When your meeting is sick and has a fever, the only remedy is Jackie Weaver.
„The chairman of this council is the chairman of the council..“
If you would like to see how to manage a zoom meeting then we reviewed the previous version and showed how it can work better so you can be as good as Jackie Weaver. have a look here: https://youtu.be/hh3yu4bzf8g
Bunch of gammons. Kick them out, Jackie!
free Brittany
So now our taxes go to these people wasting time arguing on Zoom meetings and fighting over stupid shit
Councils always good for a laugh, the nationwide standing joke.
"You HaVe nO AuTHoriTy HeRe"    He sounds like he has a broomstick jammed up his arse.
Grow up
Fucking hell. How can they run a council they can't even work a zoom call properly.
All I can see is that none of them, including jackie, are fit  to run a tea shop never mind a council. If you live there get out quick boy these morons are costing you money! All menopausal including the men ! 🙄🙄🙄
I'd like to know how the hell jackie from whitchurch, shropshire is involved in a cheshire council???????🙄🙄
Aled is the new Jeremy Dewitte from Real World Police
'You have no authority here Jackie Weaver, no authority AT ALL Jackie *click* 👋
YOU HAVE  NO  AUTHORITY HERE
There is a always somone on a zoom meeting with guitars in the background
Even Britney Spears got a mention!
This should definitely become a tv series I would gladly watch this. It be the new Jeramy Kyle show.
“Straight outta Handforth ” 👊🏿
John Smith is the rightful chairman
Aled is a horrible little man
I take charge 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This Handworth Clerk Chairman chappie is a complete and utter bell end! Pompous pratt!
Ian Ball: 'Harish Pouncil'. We've all been there, Ian.
Anyone else think John Smith is the real hero of this meeting? hahah love this whole vibe
That gasp 4:26 is a gift from heaven
0:37 damn Michael Gambon's voice really changed over the years
0:51 peter moore savage mode
Couldn't run a bath 🤔🤪🤣🤣🤣🤣
And was it here in ancient times.....
This is so chaotic omgggg
omg
" Stop talking"!! Oh dear what a bunch of hilarious non entities obsessed with procedure and self importance. Jackie Weaver rocks you guys. Go Jackie!
I could have sworn I heard the guy with the electronic voice box gadget (off Alan partridge)in that clip..
Wheres the chairman gone???.......the chairman of the council is the chairman of the council.
I cant see Jackie weaver..... TRY FACING THE SCREEN..
Spot the Brexit supporter...
Empire builders and joiners.  Total nut jobs.
And I thought HOA's were the worst thing ever. This is what happens when insignificant people get the tiniest bit of power and why nothing ever gets done.
Old fools who STILL believe in authority.
Now all but Weaver are famous for being rude jackasses.   They sacrificed moral character to throw tantrums about *decorum*. The hypocracy! And now us Yanks are laughing hard. Shame on the childish folks who didn't have the sense or wisdom to watch their mouths when they knew they were dopes with respect to technology.
Some say the turf war in East Cheshire has claimed many clerks credentials
This is better than season 8 of Game Of Thrones
0:10 anyone hear that eff off
Jackie Weaver is a national treasure
Can we make this into a TV series please?
5:49 did the exorcist join the meeting? 🤣🤣
I'm so happy for Jackie Weaver. Absolute Hero. Just as I thought COVID ruined the world it helped us discover Jackie Weaver ♥️
0:11 did someone tell the chairman to f**k off?
what a horrible woman
This is why my beloved England is in such a bad way.
Apparently Aled is a solicitor, hard though that is to believe   https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/lawyers-win-zoom-thanks-ex-tlt-parish-councillor-and-cattorney
6:31 He paused with bated breath, waiting for the uproarious laughter he was confident would come. After all, why wouldn't it? "Welcome to Handforth" he had uttered, with such panache and almost legendary comedic timing. He knew this moment would go down in history. They would talk about this for years to come. "That's strange" he thought, as he was met with prolonged silence. They have left themselves on mute, that must be it! They're all laughing for sure, he just couldn't hear it. They will all come off mute in their droves to congratulate him for sure, he knew. But still he waited, waited for the laughter that never came... "May I start?" he uttered, truly defeated.
what the hell am I watching lol
*_I've never seen a more vulgar bundle of bureaucratic Vogons in my entire life_*
"...Handforth is a fast-growing community connecting Cheshire to Greater Manchester, with a major retail centre and luxury car outlets, and easy access to Manchester Airport..."
Coming soon to Netflix
*_Despite what the fake news tell you, Jackie Weaver was indeed the antagonist_*
"We're here to elect a new chair." "I am the chair." *Kicks chair*
John Smith's random laugh at 5:06 = the rest of the world.
PC clerk has the most annoying voice ever.
You have no power here Jackie weaver and read the standing orders       😂😂😂 is the best part of the video.
This is just an episode of The Thick of it
lol boomer town
I've been a local councillor, elected by voters rather than coopted, and this meeting is not that different to the incompetence seen in similar councils around the uk. Which is why I left soon after!!! The whole of this country is governed by similarly comical and cartoonish characters and that's one reason we have a failing system of local government. 99.9% of the public don't appear to care either. It's great entertainment but this kind of idiocy is funded by public money, that you pay for via local taxation...........
"Didn't attend meetings for 6 months, despite there being no meetings"
No f*ck barry Barry has GONE
"When do we plan to start" in the background 3 seconds later "f*** off" 😂😂😂😂
Handforth is just the definition of an idiot, old, white, man, who always thinks he is better than everyone.
Lets be honest here though - Jackie was the fucking problem from the start lol.  Power control at its best, nowonder they all got frustrated as fuck though.
This is the BBC version of Parks and Rec
See this is what happens when the bowling greens and bingo halls are closed. End the lockdown 😂
Sue from the prequel is missed here
Barry Burkhill for PM
we're trying to have a teams meeting you FOOL
Is this the Cobra meeting?  ;)
Where's the Chairman gone, where's the Chairman gone?  Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep!  Comedy Gold.
The comment near the beginning implies that this isnt the first time the meetings have gone awry...
it's the fella sitting with his back to the camera that makes me laugh the most.....hahaha!
This country, is turning into Latin America...with all the temper tantrums....good posting..
No-one talking about the toilet flushing 🤣🤣
We put the disruptive members in the waiting room 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 This is brilliant!
"she just kicked him out" "No don't!"  Calm before the storm 🤣
4:24 The shouting, the gasp, the “dear me” send me every time.
I’m from hamdforth and find this a total embarrassment our village is in total disrepute over this, the waste bins in the village centre are full some hedges have gone Un trimmed for at least 4 weeks due to this there are blackberries mushed into the pavement that have fallen from the bushes, I’m looking to move away if this continues it’s like living on a council estate...
Can't wait for the Netfilix series or any movies of this in a few years time 😂
Barry Burkhill: "what are you talking about, you don't know what your talking about. The chairman of the council is the chairman of the err....er........council"  Me : Who doesn't know what they are talking about? You Barry._
i wanna see Cyn vs Sue next
Surely we need Jackie Weaver to fight against the EU. We could have VDL kicked out of meetings in minutes.
Is it councils like this across the country, full of people of a certain age, who have fenced off all the school playing fields thus removing children’s ability to play outside and have fun with their friends and confining them to their homes?
The idea that wisdom is gained with age is utter bollocks.
What an utter idiot the chairman is. Ignorant of procedures, rude and lacking any decorum. And his arrogant little sidekick is even more laughable
God you can SMELL Brexit all over this
Handforth PC clerk sounds like Winnie the Pooh
Mrs. Doubtfire calm under pressure
Cancel council tax ASAP
"I think if this were to go viral, on the internet or Facebook whatever, it would start a war of words". So true. The whole world watches with baited breath as the Hanworth council boomsquad do some real godddamn muthafkin' damage yeee haw!
Why am I so obsessed with this?
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!!
That's how you make pure comedy.most of these people are on another planet
5:50 Am I hearing Gollum ?
This is comedy parish council goldust! What a brilliant use of technology. 😂😂😂😂
The old man in Aled’s iPad is honestly hilarious, clearly the only one who sees the absurdity of the situation.
The quiet “fuck off” took me out
Did she chuck people out before this lockdown? This is hilarious to watch.
napoleon quote...'' a nation of shopkeepers''..discuss?
Lot's of Clarks living in Handforth Parish.
What is happening?
Julies iPad: You're in the great game now, and the great game is terrifying.
"I'm just in a meeting at the moment..." Utter lack of meeting decorum and discipline.
Jackie Weaver Who is alan murcdoch?  Roger small: Yes please!  🤣🤣🤣
This is the most British ting I have seen 😅
Every time I hear him say, "You have no authority here, Jackie Weaver," I always think of Gandalf saying, "You shall not pass!"
Typical councillors
I reckon Julie's I pad is going to end up like Niles' ex-wife Maris in "Frasier". You never actually see her, just hear about all her quirks and mannerisms through snippets of conversation.
It's like hearing old people facebook comments
Old people dramatically entering frame in low resolution is a genre of vine I'm sad never existed.
I am absolutely howling with laughter. Rediculous as it is. I don't understand the rules of meeting but their outbursts are hilarious.
A lot of big egos here
Sue's too loud.
The first ten seconds are exactly how my GCSE maths classes use to start with me saying ‘fuck off’ under my breath...
Aleds friend is a prick. Read my cOMMENT AND UNDERSTAND IT!!!!
These people do not occupy the same planet as me.
5:47
Peter Moore, the musician that he obviously is, should do a song about all this.
0:10 "Fuck off".
“Julie’s I pad”
Is that a toilet flushing at 07:13?
Anyone here from Alizee?
English, what a bunch of small minded muppets
I hate men.  Poor Jackie
I stand with Jackie Weaver
Long ago, the land of parish council was enveloped in peace and calm. The people of the parish council stood together in harmony. But that was before Handforth PC Clerk attacked. Under the leadership of Handforth PC Clerk, parish council is now under a cloud of disorder and confusion. Our daring hero John Smith rises in an attempt to end the disorder. With the support of his loyal friends Julie’s I Pad and Jackie Weaver, he attempts to end the dictatorship and end the tyranny of Handforth PC Clerk once and for all. It will not be easy as they must fight against Barry Burkhill, Aled’s iPad and even Handforth PC Clerk himself. The team has received unexpected support from Cyn who has decided to aid in the fight against evil. John Smith and his team are brave but will they succeed in their fight against the tyranny of Handforth PC Clerk? Tune in to tomorrow’s episode of the Handforth Parish Council anime to find out
Cannot wait to see the Netflix documentary about this
5:09 "The Chairman... the Chairman of the council is the... is the Chairman of the... of the... uhh.. council."
😂 A gift from god, thank you!
Where is Mr bean
There's so much raging anger and pomposity here. And I love it
Fuck me, these are the most childish old people I've ever seen
I am going to change my name to The Proper Officer!
Season 3 of Staged looks great
This is the most childish and pathetic behaviour I have witnessed in years. Most of you should be utterly ashamed of yourselves.
6:58 - I can't handle the savagery
"READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM" 🤣🤣🤣☠️☠️☠️ Bloody nutter. This is so good
This has HUGE 'Simon Cowell kicking Sharon and Louis out for laughing' vibes.
Jackie Weaver steps up for Olympic Committee Chair for Tokyo Olympics plus Managing  Partner at KMPG in her spare time...
Honestly I've never before seen people gone so mad with so little power
I also want to know if a turf war has indeed broken out and who has authority to mediate.
There are many laughing hyenas around, and they definitely have no authority.
6.01... Golum has now joined the meeting!! 😂🤣😂🤣
Savage at 05:02
Would love to see previous meetings that led up to this.
I hadn't seen this so just sat down and  it came up bloody fantastic I am pissin myself laughing
“Who’s this woman?      Eh.”
this is so fucking funny
Genius. I felt the need to give this the rave treatment... https://youtu.be/IPoW1uEbzqc
"I have a photograph of it" 😂😂 bloody grass
SUBPOENA !! hahahaha what a sad little man
Everything wrong with the way the UK is run in one video.
"When do we plan to start?" F*ck off!" then it just gets even better! Got to check out the memes and mocks of this. If only everyone's team meetings were like this!
The chairman of the council is the chairman of the council.....
“Oops!...I Did It Again” “I'm not that innocent” *by Jackie weaver* aka Britney Spears
Old people turning feral once the bingo is closed for corona
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM
'READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!' 'YOU GOT Thahrttt tb''
A total waste of money, time and oxygen... I hope this lot shuffle off very soon
And now we know why nothing ever gets done!! 🤪
Alens iPad for prime minister
Another national embarrassment to add to the list
Julies iPad is a truly underrated character.
Etiquette for the meeting  Someone speaks and when they have finished someone else speaks. Butting in and talking over people is very bad form!!!
Why does young Aled iPad sound like a gangster from 1940s American movies?
*let's hope Netlfix never sees this, it's got an excellent plot and writing*  Old man 1 - "I hope I do not get thrown out of the meeting like last time"  Old man 2 - "Quite rightly!"
"Mrs Weaver pLeAse" - Aled's iPad
Love Roger Small's quite dramatic introduction.
This chairman is a nightmare
Millions of views and not a single like / dislike. This video is a singularity
Why did they vote him as chair if they don't like him?
LMAO never seen so many people waste so much time arguing about absolutely NOTHING.
Now I’ve seen the prequel I know exactly what is going on
Ladies & gentleman, as a libertarian, I give you; government in action.
Are these people being paid for being this unprofessional?
Peters just there waiting for a high five ✋
Fuck me. Government clearly needs ripping out at the roots, spraying with the harshest chemicals available, and replanting with anything that isn't this nonsense.
"Mrs Weaver, I'm not a cat!"
What drugs are these goons on?
"stop being whatever it is you're trying to be" -- good advice for anyone
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Against the law? In a Parish Council meeting? NUTJOB!
Skullduggery in Handforth
i am the senate
Coming from you from Birkenhead that sounds good!
Priceless!  After 18 minutes was anything decided or voted on , or anything else at all? We used to have sailing club committee meetings when half the time was spent arguing about the "constitution " and what was or wasn't in it and who could say or do what,  that did me for committees!
I’ve had to watch this again angry sub poena man reminds me of Mandy dingles boyfriend in emmerdale - then a few mins down the line flushing this has to be the funniest maddest cracked up stuffed up pompous political I’ve got more authority than you video ever
Jackie gets abuse for 5 mins John: Welcome to Handforth
Maybe just me, but I really cannot see why this became such a big news story. All the TV networks covered it and newspapers too as if it was the funniest thing ever. There are far funnier things on YT to laugh about.
I love how they use the full names instead of just like Jackie lmao
Why is the cackling loon on Aled's iPad so down on Birkenhead?
Actually, once the two troublemakers were kicked out of the meeting, it became a humorous and friendly meeting.
Why does Aled’s iPad have demons in the background
Monty Python is alive and well!
What were they actually supposed to be arguing about?  What was the meeting before my held for
The best thing to come out of Britain since Harry Potter.
Everybody gangsta until you question Jackie Weavers authority
I Pad
Sue was defo trying to get with Alan
I love the awkward silence and then quick look over from Aled at 5:31
Why is there a toilet flush at 7:12?
what a joke they all are
The Chairman starts causing trouble even before the meeting starts which he has said  hasn't started.  Rude bugger!
That Lady after kicking chairman was like "I'm The Senate!"
Where is the chairman!! 🤣
Jackie weaver is power mad
Would love to see January meetings
big up julie's I pad
I think all of us have a little Jackie in our character.  Brilliant video!
Basic law? my ar$e
Jackie is so articulate 😍
Is anyone else amazed that Barry "the chairman of the council is the chairman of the council" Burkhill is the mayor? 😂
John Smith is such a John Smith
5.48 Gollum entered the zoom call 😂😂😂😂
Who the hell are these people? Who do they think they are? Every single one of them should be ashamed of their behaviour. Sums up everything wrong with the sort of people who want to be involved in politics. Sickening.
5:47  Gollum enters the chat
It's when they carve out their own little mostly inconsequential domains and are left to it because nobody really cares that much to scrutinise you that small scale politics gets vicious. The smaller the jurisdiction the more horrific the arguments. Councils, university committees, community groups are full of people who would be tinpot dictators If given half a sniff of power.  The petty divisions always widen until nobody will even look at each other any more.
ngl I'm pretty sure jackie is wrong she should read and understand the standing orders
Aled's dad is such a troll :'D Lives for the chaos
Roger Small, right at the beginning is just casually sharpening a knife. Convince me otherwise.
A very good example of bullying within Cheshire East
9:40 Britney Spears???
Don't know how I stumbled across this but is it a comedy show 😂 no wonder the country is in a mess
This is pure gold!!!!!
Call me Britney Spears from now on! Love it
"Nothing, if not lively, in Handforth." That's for sure. ; )
VIDEO OF THE YEAR.
16:13 is a gem
Who's the genius on Youtube who makes epic rock tracks to funny political moments on TV?  I want him working on this movies soundtrack, ASAP.
They are trying to disrupt usss, but we have the *preciousss* - the standing ordersss! And the subpoenasss!
Top notch thumbnail-editing skills with the Word Art 😂 sure brings back memories
Aleds boyfriend needs to chill out. Spoilt brat
Underrated moment: Ian Ball looking cuffed that he took a photograph of a Zoom name tag
How can I see the previous meeting? Are they all public domain?
@11:22 🤣 « Who’s is Alan » ➡️ « yes please » 🙋🏻‍♂️
Cynthia: No. 😂
“Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on” 😂
This sitcom is absolutely brilliant - that said I am gutted that the Handforth PC clerk was killed off so quickly, just as it was getting good 😌
Even Smeagol is in this
5:30 Here comes the speeder!
When the fools were kicked into the waiting room and the adults tookover what a difference. Seriously that guy shouting at Jackie like a big man is a disgrace. So if the chairman who thinks he’s chosen one, power gone to your head much. Reign it in and grow up children
That old man laughing on Aled's iPad is so funny.
These people were an embarrassment, even if you disagree with someone you don’t act like that it’s pathetic and childish. The guy shouting at that woman is beyond sad, its clear these people are not fit to be leaders within their communities. Not to mention do they not know how to mute themselves
Thanks ArthurTV
What were they even discussing?
I still don't get where the so-called bullying is. So people got animated, big deal.
Ever Decreasing Circles
Wondering why this is in my suggestions and wondering moreso, why I am watching.
You can see why the English need a monarchy: They're not yet ready for democracy.
Lockdown got us all like . . . Haha
Nothing will ever beat the entrance of Roger Small
Did anyone else notice how the chair actually has his name as "Handforth PC Clerk" ? Love it
Funniest meeting I’ve ever witnessed 😂😂🤣🤣
Jackie Weaver is an absolute legend , and a gem !
Annoying people. I would be surprised if anything gets done there.
Absolute chaos 😳😂
John smith for chair man
For the greater good
Scrapping the bottom of the barrel this shit going viral.
when counsellors get sent to the naughty step
Is it just me, or is this just showing all the reasons that we should fill our government with competent/capable young people and not just a bunch of useless fuds who can't even use Zoom properly and lose their minds when they get their feelies hurt
Gotta say. Peter has some cherry axes there.
5:45 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
I've been trying to remember who the guy reminds me of who loses it, and its just come to me: Mike McClean from the Big Breakfast. Not sure anyone agrees, but I'm glad that's off my chest.
Now this is REAL British reality TV
Read them and understand them!!!
This is a MW2 lobby personified in OAP's
Chairman and vice chairman very angry people.  Horrible power seeking bullies
Half of this video is just people saying 'um' lol
Is this an episode of Googlebox?
The gentlemen on Aled's Pad did not appear to be social distancing. Maybe they belong to the same household.
Bunch of pale middle class silver spooners- no wonder why we dont see the point in voting. This meeting cost me how much, Mr P.A.Y.E?
Ian really should get his mic checked
Fly you fools!!!
Jackie weaver is obviously in the wrong here.
This reminds me of James Joyce. Epic. Hope he writes something about this.
Jesus christ......these people could argue in a room on their own.....jumped up miserable tossers with a high opinion of themselves
Who muttered the “fuck off” at the start?! 😂
Non Brits have to realise that apart from the odd bloke flipping his top, most of this is humour. Very similar probably to 1000s of work calls happening across the UK every day!  I'm on one now while typing this!
Kim Woodburn should have been sent instead of Jackie Weaver.
Vice chair in the house!🙌 4:20
The Clerk thought he was speaking with Jackie the Grey. She is now Jackie the White
men like this are the reason that women are rare in these local councils, especially younger women. Bullies.
All aleds iPad characters are underrated
What a joke. These people are running our councils. Then you have younger turds running our country. And the level of disrespect from the men. Shame on all those men that laughed and jeered and shouted. Absolutely awful. Well done Jackie for your positive behaviours. The sad thing is, this behaviour is rife and even worse in parliament. And while we sit here and laugh and feel disgust or whatever, guess what. They're still behaving this way. It can only be fixed by our votes but look at how we've been voting in recent times...STILL keeping these asshalves in control
The meeting needs to be held in accordance with the law. The interloper woman was usless as she had no idea how to handle these experienced committee members within the system they are bound by. The people who complained and brought her in  were obviously out of order too.
Are you serious? This perfectly normal, everyday disorderly Council Meeting goes viral?!...Jackie Weaver is just another Council Member defending her dubius meeting status.....which does not excuse the bellicose ranting of others.
‘When do we plan to start?’ ‘Fuck off’- Brilliant!
I really hope Netflix releases a remake of this, cast with Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, etc, etc.
So many Type A Personalities, I'm convinced a full-blown fight would have broken out if this weren't a zoom call.  And everyone involved weren't 70+.
5:49 is me when I die on warzone final circle
Whose Alan 😂
These people would make a funeral seem like an interesting event
Better than any episode of Parks & Rec 😂
Aled jr’s whispered yells before “we’re trying to have a teams meeting you fool” i can’t cope 😭😂
the intermittent gasps from Julie’s I pad give me life
I can't wait for the children of Mitchell Brook Primary School in Neasden to act this out for Big Fat Quiz of the Year 2021
what a bunch of amateurs
Stick to making jam and putting posters up in the villages
Ah parish British councils i live in a village they dont do a lot hzve no powers and are never seen except for harvest day
this is England ! The real one!
Thank goodness for the nice guy with the guitars!!!
Outrageous the way they just try to talk over Cyn too and make rude regionalist comments about her coming from Birkenhead??  I thought things like that went out with the dark ages.  I know they are meant to be "only joking", but it is yet another way of marginalising her and aiming to make her look unintelligent or irrelevant.  Cyn made some really valuable contributions and wasn't afraid to challenge on several occasions.
I can't stop watching this.
I love John throwing some shade on the Brewerton household's reaction, particularly after he laughed at Sue too 😁
All voted for Brexit no doubt.
John Smith laughing at Jackie weaver and then gets selected and acts as if he is white as snow hmmmmmmmmm
Oh Hiya I’m just in a meeting at the moment
✨🌹✨ I do feel that those who aspire to such roles should “ shadow” those who have been carrying out such roles for many many years. Then they maybe may learn something and their hearts may become somewhat wiser. Local authority business is an absolute nightmare, and Ill tutored minds drawn from the local community, who have absolutely no formal training or prior experience in holding board meetings. It’s got to end in catastrophe really  hasn’t it !! Like giving a monkey a hand grenade !! It’s got to end in catastrophe !! People need to be trained, monitored and tutored to do a job well. Anybody can do anything at all, if of course, you have been trained !! Totally stupid in my view. Totally stupid !  Magistrates are even worse !  Even worse !! Little knowledge of social issues !! Send them to prison !! Send them all to prison !! Terrible people in many ways !! Terrible people !! Power of any kind, without a brain, is an awful thing !  A totally awful thing !! ✨💖✨
Nasty people !!! Nasty nasty people !!!
✨🌹✨ Now I just want to sit in a dark room and think about my childhood. You’ve driven me right into myself, you really have. You’ve all driven me right into myself !!!✨🌹✨💖✨
FACT: Jackie Weaver does not attend meetings. Meetings attend Jackie Weaver!
“They rebadged it you fool”
I think someone's medication isnt working right.
Who’s Alan Murdock? Yes please.
Aled needs serious help!!
Jesus. I’m sure I’ve seen these guys on ‘The Nightmare Neighbour Next Door’ making some poor sod’s life hell because their fence is 3mm higher than regs.
read the comments section READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!
“WE’RE TRYING TO HAVE A TEAMS MEETING YOU FOOL!”
Look! I'm using the internet!
5:48 Gollum has entered the chat
Stop being whatever it is you’re trying to be.  Sounds fair enough.
4:18  man saw his moment to seize unlimited power
I used to work with a woman from Handforth who was exactly like hyacinth bucket from keeping up appearances
Aled screams UKIP
Your NOT the proper officer
Better than the Vicar of Dibley!
Can Alan Murdoch be invited in? Whose Alan Murdoch? I have Alan Murdochs IPad......🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣
Am I the only person here that has absolutely no fuckin idea what’s going on here?
0:10 does someone already say ''fuck off'?
Self important tosh it really is...
“When do we plan to start?” “Fuck off”
Weaver requesting to be called Brittany spears from now on 😂😂😂 get fuc*ed weaver
Well does Jackie Weaver have the authority to call this meeting or not? I NEED TO KNOW
So Hot Fuzz was a documentary...
I think this went viral since I'm watching from the United States and laughing.
Jackie Weaver is actually Meryl Streep, and this is new Hollywood.
(evil noises)
Heard about this and was wondering what it was all about glad I stumbled on this..lol
When do we plan to start? "Fcuk off".
"Chairman.exe encountered an error and had to close"
Jackie Weaver certainly has the power to say Um a lot
Special appearance by Donald Duck at 5:48
Love John Smith
Barry was a bully.  So was his number 2.  This is why Jackie was called in
Vicar of Dibley wishes it could be this funny
Shoutout to David Pincombe who recognised this meeting's potential as a viral video!
This is why our councils don't have any bloody money. It's SO painful to watch.
Dreadful misogyny whilst trying to hide behind procedural nonsense. You show them Jackie! Kick em out!!!!!
Can we have a standalone episode when we find out what happened with Julie's Ipad telephone call - she said she would call back. Im hoping she is the lead negotiator for the new Jaffa Cakes are Biscuits special planning agenda
i love suee tho sue ganngggg
Cyn doesn’t deserve any authority. Ruins the mood
The 'chairman' is such a jobsworth.
When you’re trying to watch a film at the cinema and that one guy at the back won’t shut up  2:16
Gang War!
The biggest mystery of this entire meeting is... who is the chairman?
“Where’s the chairman gone?” “I kicked the twat”
is that Gollum in the background at 6 minutes 🤣🤣🤣
Did any of them know what they were actually supposed to be discussing?
Peter Moore is my hero
Barry got shut down by woman. He will never live it down. Hahaha
High school isn't as bad as this. Or even primary school
You have no authority "Herr JackBoot (old) Weaver" now go play them deep pocket cards to the MSM and get me a cup of Rosy Lee and a ham butty dear........INCOMING  time head the safe place man cave ok  ok shed and hunker down with a kipper for breakfast and a daily dose of ...META TARO..via Tubes of You hole of rabbits , To face who/what ever the day brings....
WILL YOU STOP TALKING will you please listen
NO THEY DONT BECAUSE THE VICE CHAIRS HERE I TAKE CHARGE
Pensioners behaving badly 👍Bless em😆These meetings should be held once a week.
Do we know who is right and who is wrong?
hahaha what a mess, Well done Jackie for being professional
00:10 !!!!!! anyone else hear that ?!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
this is the edited version and it is painful to watch.  So glad i wasn't present for the full meeting,
Didn't want it viral!!  Over 2 million have made that comment irrelevant!
John Smith laughing at them all is brilliant
Jackie Weaver... I've never seen so little power go to someones head.
Reece shearsmith and Steve pemberton need to play the Alad iPad boys...
Hits differently after watching the prequel
That old man laughing ...... he made my day😂😂😂
Stupid Hobbits
Proof that anything can become a meme
“Under the name of the parish council, you’re under arrest”  Jackie weaver: “I am the parish council.”
This is how politics works and it’s pathetic.
The Gollum/"We're trying to have a teams meeting you fool" bit is so strange, who was he even talking to there and what was with that voice?
Good job it didn't go viral - can you imagine!
"You don't know what you're talking about!" proceeds to bumble over what the role of the chairman actually is. Burkhill is a fool.
The 'clerk' or chair shouts "would you stop talking!" like a school teacher that has lost control of his class room.
How quintessentially British omg I had to laugh.
YoU Have NO AuThOrItY hErE jAckiE WeAvEr
John smith takes MVP for this call, good mediator and good laugh
It's scary as a young person to see these types of people have any kind of responsibility over my future
We're trying to have a teams meeting you fool! Sounds like him from League of Gentlemen
Mrs Weaver Please!!!???????
Stop being whatever it is you're trying to be..... what, a boss 😎
If only the Oscars did the best opening sequence, the whispered "fuck off" 10 seconds in would win easily
“Fuck off” 🤣
John Smith you are the true chairman
David knew it would be trouble.
0:11 - "fuck off"
Vice chair was great.  He was so angry
When old people try and use computers
Moral here is always host the meetings.
The best bit is David Pincombe popping up at the end like Nostradamus predicting it will go viral!
Will you stop being whatever it is you're trying to be?
16:13 well that aged well didn’t it
3:53 "It's only the chairman who can remove people from the meeting."  Few seconds later... chairman gets removed from meeting 🤣
5.50  I HAVE NO WORDS IM STILL DYING FFS 😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
To be fair, there are a lot of small and not so small council meetings that go on like this. I’m impressed this one has gone viral.
The most important question -  Has the UN convened an emergency summit yet?
The league of gentlemen should do a Royston Vasey parish meeting
Um
this is way the UK is F&^cked up because of these sill old farts with nothing else todo
Sue has integrity. Can’t say that a lot about many other people in Handforth.
Average age is apparently 81.
Ahaha. Insulting Birkenhead.  LAWLZ
Ha ha ha--that Jackie weaver is sooooo arrogant! She just doesn't get it and ratepayers pay her salary SMH That's what happens when one controls the Zoom :))))) What a DYSFUNCTIONAL council! HOPELESS! Who the F@#$% is the Chair? The Vicar of Dibley ran better meetings :)))
Anyone know of any channels doing episode breakdowns? There’s so many complicated story elements and character dynamics. Maybe I should read the manga.
5:48 has me in tears
10 minutes of drama Barry: Where's the chairman
jackie ur iconic don't listen to the haters
Are these the sort of people who block all the nice houses from being built on Grand Designs?
Britney spears has really aged.
13:40 Wait a second,  how can dude bitch about someone not being at a meeting when there were no meetings held? They've all had too much warm beer.
Beautiful! Hysterical.  I've been at those meetings!
Underrated moment: Julie getting a call during the meeting lol
While this is very funny it is also the reason why Great Britiain is up the shit spout
Jackie fucking weaver everybody
Julie's I pad
People of Handforth........... Good luck.
I'm worried that the neighbourhood plan steering group may have gone rogue. Just as they've lowered the terrorist threat from severe to substantial!. This is not going to end well.....
Presumably Jackie Weaver was brought in as a trouble shooter and all officers and committee members of the council where informed of this, in advance of this EGM.
'Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on. *muted laughter*' has me howling
THE FCKING FLUSHING NOISE MJFNDJSHFKSHF
What was that fckin gollum voice
At what time setting does the toilet flush.  Is that on Julie's iPad?
I hope the ‘Proper Officer’ and ‘Monitoring Officer’ are in the next meeting.
This is what happens when minor officials and busy bodies get any miniscule bit of power. Tbh it looks like the council has been stagnating as when people feel like they are being undermined and can't control themselves / deal with it, they do this.
John Smith and Old man Aled's iPad laughs absolutely send me 😂😂😂
What a bunch of loosers, and they are supposed to be in charge. Play school kids have more manners that bunch of tossers
Does anyone else still not really know what caused all the fuss or is it just me?
Iv done a tier list of the  Handforth Parish Council members on my YouTube channel, if you wanted a quick laugh it’s so funny man  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FQ0sWCLtojM
Jackie weaver the lil Hitler
This is better than Eastenders
- "Alan's iPad or Alan?" - "Yes."  -Edit: Hey, thanks for all of the likes!
Can someone pls explain what's going on?
STOP TALKING!
Toxic chairman aside they’re a lovely bunch.
Youtube recommendations did it again!
um, um, um.......
She’s kicked Barry out so I’m leaving
Handforth PC Clerk 'when do we plan to start?....... Roger Smail' Fuck offf' (blandwich breath)
Someone shouting good riddance when that women answers her phone in the meeting
Power trippy woman, supported by more power trippy women in the background /
I nominate Jackie weaver as the new carrol baskin.
What the fack is this?! Why are those people in positions of power, they are in marasmatic age, they are more rude than a transgender feminist at Crowder's table and they have zero knowledge of their material.
Jackie Weaver would you plz listen👹😁
Here we go some tantrum about something.....🙄😆😆🤣
Random tiger growl at 7:13
Thats alot of Brexiteers in one Zoom!!!
And the meeting was called to address the bullying of some of the men 😂 You couldn't make it up 😅😂
This is like Cluedo
A bunch of old age "I WANT TO BE ON THE TELE" PENSIONERS
I must make up at least 1 million of the views
"can I ask you to be respectful to Jackie" all start laughing
Hilarious. Jumped up old white guys.
You know how people go to sites of famous movies for tours? Looking forward to touring this parish soon!
Victor Mildew as the “Parish Clerk”
The Parish Council will decide your fate.  Jackie Weaver: I am the Council.  4:22  what anyone is here for.
YOU HAVE NO POWER HERE!!!!!!!
I want to know how much authority Julie's iPad has??
"When do we plan to start"..... "fuck off" - it's at this point that it dawned on me, you will only be able to watch this once for the first time so go and get a drink and some popcorn, this shit is gonna be good :P
Jackie trains councillors, this lot will be getting a refresher course.
He hasn’t attended a meeting in 6 months, since last November that fact there haven’t been any meetings isn’t relevant
Bring Me the Head of Alan Murdoch!
Nice to see that the Chair and Vice-Chair  lead by force and not by example.
Those men, Barry and Aled, and whoever the hyena was with him, need to be voted out immediately. Full of their own self-importance and acting like 5-year-olds. Appalling.
Oh the sexual tension on display!!
I love how Julie just took that call, unmuted, with zero craps given
Absolutely hilarious! 😂  I'm now finding myself telling my homeschooling kids (when they don't understand something), 'READ IT AND UNDERSTAND IT' 😆
Let’s not forget John Smith was laughing at Jackie and Sue when it all kicked off.   Never trust John Smith.
LOL This is what happens when our older people used our computers haha :D
5:20 is the peak moment
2:15 Big yikes. That outburst was so full of vitriol. No place for anyone talking to other people like this.
This is the older generation
love this show but i wish Handforth PC Clerk hadn’t been killed off so early
Is this a sketch?????? Good lord!!!!
Lord preserve us. I suppose that's what happens in villages. Not very polite are they?
This is like Game of Thrones
The chairman was worried and rightly so from being thrown out again.
Jackie Weaver is kinda annoying.
5:49 Gollum
They really put the grandma from the Lorax in here and thought we wouldn’t notice smh
Very well edited and cut!
When a group of boomers are forced to use technology, comedy gold! 😂🤣
3:48 That's a bit strong
Unintelligible Tantrum Noises.
She clearly is utterly clueless, no wonder the others were getting so frustrated and angry
✨ Dream cast for upcoming BBC  miniseries "The Parish" ✨ Jackie - Dame Judi Dench (Duh. She's already fighting for the role). John Smith - Bradley Walsh or Alan Davies (the confused yet wholesome everyman) Julie's iPad - Dame Emma Thompson (comedy gold) Chairmen Brian - Jim Broadbent (tell me he's not born for the role) Sue - Imelda Staunton (a no nonsense icon) Alan Brewerton - Andy Serkis (let's face it, Brewerton is literally just Gollum) Brewerton Snr - Sir Anthony Hopkins (he has the maniacal laughing down to a T) Cynthia - Dame Helen Mirren (obviously) Guitar Guy Peter - Simon Pegg or Sir Ben Kingsley (can we merge them?) Alan - Chris Eccleston or Bill Nighy (both suave and would love to swing on a whirly chair while cracking a naughty step joke) Ian - Sir Kenneth Branagh (posh, opinionated and confused by the mute button) Ashley - Surprise mystery cameo from HRH Princess Anne
This has made my day 🤣🤣🤣
Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on!
Sue wants Alan BAD.
click this button repeatedly for a laugh 14:32
Some Rightmove analyst next month, "What the hell has happened to the property values in Handforth Parish?"
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM
how did Jackie Weaver become a hero? she's awful! i totally agree with the REAL chairman - she has no authority but acts like the Queen!
I would love to know  their opinions on Brexit, no still better, have a debate!
This video highlights why this country is a joke, jumped up no marks given a little bit of power achieving absolutely nothing, all in the name of democracy pmsl.
I don't see anything at all wrong with anything Cllr Tolver did in this meeting before he was thrown out. Weaver was there to take minutes not to run the meeting
I was running clans on runescape with hundreds of members and 100+ concurrent players PKIng on a Saturday when I was around 13, and these set of doofuses can’t even have 5 people organised enough to make any progress. Can’t wait til their generation dies off, my generation inherits what ashes of the country remain and we can finally start making progress in the world
Definitely turn subtitles on.... it adds so much to the production. The way some framed the video of them facing backwards as if working and then turned around dramatically to make a point was brilliant. The Lady from Birkenhead rules! She was fabulous
0:10 coughs subtly
Jesus Christ is coming soon   It isn’t too late to follow him
My favourite bit:  Roger Small;: "Can I formulate an official reply to that letter?"  John Smith: “Thank you, Roger. Yes, we will be *interrupted by a noise that sounds like someone on the bog having a particularly bad one* …sry, We will be elaborating on that as well.”  Poignant.
Roy cropper's (coronation street) type of Netflix and chill
0:10
This is my favourite anime
She has no authority to do any of this and is bossing around everyone illegally...She is typical of whats going on today....madame dictator with no mandate...
No wonder Britain has built half the number of houses needed for the last few decades.
The vice chairman in the background “I’m going to subpoena everybody” 😂
Gollum joins at 5:48
This deserves its own BBC drama. I think that a new Midsummer Murder plot is unfolding right here.  People are so bitchy and biting aren’t they? .....  You are all VOLUNTEERS ..... supposed to be working for the common good, and some men really don’t want to admit that it is 2021 do they? ..... Having been involved in the board of a Housing Association I can safely say never again. The job was fantastic, and real help was available for the tenants.... but blocked at every turn by people like this.  Mostly old men, who loved the sound of their own voice and didn’t want to listen to any other point of view then their own despite the fact that they weren’t going to be impacted at all.
I can’t  tell you how many times i have watched this
"A councillor didn't attend a meeting for six months... the fact no meetings were held, is irrelevant".  Hahahhahahaa.
Boot Jackie. She's a power grabbing joke
*zoom meeting between the most pathetic and petty people in England.
Every single one of these people voted Leave. Change my mind.
You're MUTED IAN
Shocking! how can such children be members of a council?! shocking!
Boot the chairman and vice, make John smith the chairman, sue vice and then make Alan Murdoch a councillor. All in favour say aye
I want to see a fight between the Vice Chair and Ronnie Pickering.
I was thrown out of the meeting.  *quite rightly*
😂 what a complete shit show 😂 this is how society fails
I want to see the last meeting, the one referenced where the false PC Clerk of Handforth gets booted out😂
“The law has been broken!”  “Coming from you from Birkenhead!”  Absolutely anything that came from Aled slowly losing his mind, whispering through gritted teeth implying he was that apoplectic with rage that he forgot people could still hear him and going full Basil Fawlty by the end.   The low-key flirtatious banter between Sue and Alan   Cyn disagreeing and objecting to absolutely any suggestion from either side  Absolutely stunning stuff.
The reason for Brexit in a nutshell
Is this a sample of what goes on at council meetings? Silly old men trying to wield power...what a set of arse holes,sack the lot! And if they get paid for this then make them pay it back.
Jackie weaver I'd a power hungry n o b
British democracy at work....🤣🤣no wonder it took 4 years for Brixit.
Please can somebody add levan polka and vibe cat to this video
Lawful good: Barry Chaotic good: Jackie Weaver Neutral good: Sue  True Neutral: Alan’s iPad Lawful Neutral: John Smith Chaotic Neutral: Peter  True Evil: Jackie Weaver Lawful Evil: Chairman Chaotic Evil: Aled and Golem  *Irredeemable Evil: Cyn*
Angry pompous little people filled with petty grievances towards one another. The whole thing is pathetic. And to think it’s a PARISH council! Marvellous Christians this lot are.
All sat in front of computers and iPad but get up to check the date on a calendar :D
Jackie wants to be the big dog it seems Also a good thing it wasn’t a face to face meeting it would of ended up as a free for all brawl there would of been chairs flying Jackie dropping an elbow drop off a cabinet to aled through a table
Black people get castigated for this kind of behaviour, now,  white people can feel what it's like to have your rights denied and then cancelled; You're not so in control are you?  Cancel culture isn't new to black people, it's always been our way of life.
Which one is Julie's ipad?
The “fuck off” at 0:11 really sets the tone for the whole meeting
"6:06 you have no power here, gandalf the grey"
I am interested in seeing the email that Ian Ball reports being in possession of and reflecting the chair saying he has taken over as clerk.
Ban zoom calls for government and professional offices, let them use hazard suits, spacesuits, etc.
Gollum turning up at 5:50 is EVERYTHING
"Could I ask you to be respectful to Jacie Weaver please?" *(Sarcastic laughter)*
Jesus, no wonder nothing gets done in this country what a bunch of dithering, self-serving wasters.
I want to know more about these people incl. political party. I especially want to know more about Peter Moore, and why he is in this meeting along with other members of the public. There’s only like 4 of them.
Have we just witnessed a coup. That Jackie Weaver is a witch.
2.9 million views - congratulations! Love this.
What is her issue? what an idiot. People like that wind me up so much lmao.
Watching this again with captions on is too good 😂😂😂
Wtf did I just watch?
I love this video so much I had to make this tshirt 🙂   https://etsy.me/36SQdFb
my parish council here can be bad but NOTHING like that! the kind of thing you see with the parish council here is the same stuff you see in the house of commons. This those "men" are acting like 3 year olds who have just been told No to the sweets that are bad for them.
Parish council meetings all a load of tosh, you discuss if your lucky, then they still do ‘exactly as they wish ‘
Having watched the full length video and a lot of other videos dating back to 2015, I can tell you the following:  - Aled is actually the younger, left-hand-side figure in the 'Aled's iPad' mise en scène. This is not even him at his angriest. In another video he reads out a piece of legal advice he has been given. When Alex Murdoch asks if they can have a copy of it he refuses on grounds of confidentiality despite the fact he has just been recorded reading it out. He also warns that if anyone emails him asking for a copy he will have them prosecuted for 'molestation'. When the other councillors laugh at him for saying this he responds 'TRY IT'. He also mentioned in the full-length video that he has failed a lawsuit against the Parish Council in the High Court. Let's hope they have Zoom.  - Brian Tolver (the chairman in this video but whose username is 'Handforth PC Clerk') wasn't always the head honcho. As recently as 2017 he was a marginal and crumpled figure given to disrupting meetings by sending them down meaningless tangents. At one point a member of the public alleged they had been 'warned off' from attending the meetings and Brian investigated the mystery with all the zeal and subtlety of Columbo (although obviously not quite as well dressed).  - The viral video is only the tip of the iceberg of the seething contempt that Pete Moore has for Brian Tolver and which he is not remotely shy about vocalising. I will bet money his is the voice that says 'fuck off' at the start of the call when Tolver's giant face is visible.  - The power struggle has been going for at least a year with Tolver, Aled, and Barry Burkhill versus everyone else. Since July, Cheshire East Council (the level of government immediately above) have been investigating reports of war in the HPC and this has already resulted in what Jackie W describes as 'the most strongly-worded letter I have ever seen a monitoring officer send a parish council', as well as Jackie herself being dispatched as a roving troubleshooter.  - According the the HPC website, the next meeting is due to take place on 11th Feb and one of the motions due to be debated is whether or not the council should fund a local production of Dick Whittington.  - Cyn and Sue clearly both fancy a piece of Alex Murdoch and a love triangle storyline is almost certain to develop.  - I still don't know who the old geezer next to Aled is who laughs 'like a hyena'.  - John Smith is a really, really solid, great guy who is a credit to Handforth (and it's environs).  I live about seven miles from Handforth. If anyone wants me to do a bit of local investigating, feel free to direct me...
Kids
Now you see the violence inherited in the system. Well I thought we were an autonomous collective..
The eroticism of power.
Chairman: “You have no authority here, Jackie Weaver. No authority at all.”  Jackie Weaver: “Bye, Felicia.”
Dreadful woman
“The greater good”
Good old British comedy gold! 👌😂😂🤣, god help us! 🇬🇧
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE
Lockdown getting to everyone.... Love the gollum bit 😂😂😂
7:13 a toilet has now entered the meeting 🚽
I didn't know Reece Shearsmith and Eric Clapton were members of the Council
wtf is this, omegalul
I'm sure the chairman is still cursing under his breath.
you cant make this shit up
The whole lot of them need sacking
First time I’ve ever heard being from Birkenhead being used as an insult. Daniel Craig is from the Wirral. Bet he wouldn’t have insulted him. I’m team Cynthia.
My fav part is when the person on alds iPad having and rant and the old guy is just like okay 😂 trying to calm him down but ends up kicking off and gets kicked out anyway 😂
At one point I thought the person on Aleds iPad called Jackie fat then I realised he actually said do u not get it. I thought things had taken a new level 😂
Like a Monty Python sketch.
(gasp)
What a horrible behavior, how disrepecful to other. No manners. Laughing at coworkers? Horrible men.
Nice bit of gurning by Cllr Tolvey at 41 secs.
What in the entire fuck is this
Is this a windup? Heard so much about it and just lost ten minutes of my life. Not funny and very boring.zzzzz.
7:13 Gollum got so upset he had to go for a shit
Was that a toilet flushing at 7:36?
Was that Gollum at 5:49-5:58?
...I’d very much like to attend the next Zoom council meeting.
This video is prove that man especially the old ones hate women and are bullying assholes
18.09 There is a vacancy... all those brave enough may apply 🤣
In the world of social media be very careful what you say, you may have a much bigger audience one day than you thought (nearly 3 million views!).
A sub-committee of the steering group. Edge of the seat stuff !!
When you think your MP is shite, and you see the alternatives waiting in the wings...
This is what happens when you give a bitter, twisted woman abit of power.
If this is the quality of local councillors there’s not much hope for the rest of us. What a lot of plonkers!
My nan lives in a converted church hall with 5 neighbours and they  formed a company so they're sort of their own landlord and this is  exactly what their meetings are like.
Turf war 😂 like the Godfather with the bosses of the 5 families being hit during the baptism scene
Hello from England, I'm afraid, rumour has it, that the meeting has STILL not actually started
hilarious but at the same time deeply disturbing. portrays in the most RAW way the profound issues that this country has
Wow I didn’t know smeagol was at the meeting, I’m leaving, lol
“My potions are too strong for you Jackie”
She sounds like the people on the phone and eletric companies
Cheers from The States!  English people - - even within the midst of argument - - *still seem like* the sweetest people in the world. lolol  I can't wait to finally make the trip across the pond to watch my beloved City play and match (in person) and meet some of you beautifully polite tea-drinkers.  This whole little meeting made me chuckle... you guys are all so nice - - even when you're trying not to be  Thanks for the entertainment
What a bunch of muppets .
I beseech thee, can someone please provide an English translation of the gollum-like utterances that take place between 5:40 and 6:00. I need it; It is life.
This is what happens when you let the older generation on teams... Idiots.
Only in England.............................      Can't wait for episode 2.
Legal eagle should weigh in on this
Cynthia is boss! Like her..
This is a bunch of male bullies, except Peter and Ian, the laughing and encouraging bullies is unbelievable. They act like kids, shame on them. John Smith comes on and says "apologies to you Jackie Weaver" proceeds to validate the bullying by saying "welcome to Handforth" in other words it’s acceptable here to act like lunatics!  Unbelievable!
UM, UM, UM, UM, UM
That bitter pc clerk.. is very difficult.
Julie's I pad   oh hiyer,  am just in a meeting at the moment,  hilarious
Why dose system of the downs playing in the background, go so well with this video
This just fails to get boring ! ... at any point !! ... We really need to see the Handforth Parish Prequal meeting, if this is the result of that meeting, Then (add deity here) only knows how bad that previous meeting was.  This is better than BBC TV Prime Time .        :) :)
Season 2 Jackie Weaver flies to Myanmar and stages a coup to remove the Burmese military from office - by zoom!
One of the funniest unscripted comedies to have happened in 2021.
A fine piece of British entertainment....just what we need in these "tumultuous times!
This is like the start of a whodunit or midsummer murder....won't go into who would be murdered as social media might say I'm asking for them to be harmed lol
Classic British comedy gold!
All of the councillors are a disgrace and should either resign or be suspended.
Plays out like a Zoom Lockdown episode of The Thick of It 😂😂
4:28 a new character has entered the lobby
Are they using Internet  from 2004?
Plot Twist - All footage recorded at the Thursday evening therapy session held at the Handforth rest home for retired and distressed local government officer's, facilitated by John (Building Manager), and Jackie (guest senior medical practitioner)
Jackie "commence order 66"
Seem to be the only one who thinks some of them are absolute nightmares and would never go near Handforth after this 😅😅
Why is this so funny?! That John Smith loved it as much as me.
this is funny but these people need to be physically removed from any position of power. Also fuck the media and I'm glad you've realised just how much bullshit the news puts out.
this is funny but these people need to be physically removed from any position of power
15:58 Every zoom class I ever teach.  "You're muted"
Chairman explains a point. Clerk immediately recommends replacing the Chairman (Intention before the meeting commenced). Clerk's style of democracy is modeled on the Democratic Republic of North Korea.
It reminds me of discord 😅
This is like a plotline for Midsummer Murders.
Way to go Jackie! Grace under pressure.
David’s foretelling is commendable 16:14
For a parish, these lot really do have a potty mouth
Sue's passive aggressive throat clearing at 14:32 deserves more attention
What’s the deal with this? What’s the problem
Coming soon, the Peter Kay version of parish politics lol
hahaha
By the looks of it Jackie weaver overstepped her boundries. How can you remove the chairman and vice chairman?  Isn't that mutiny or insurrection?
Bunch of complete sausages who when push comes to shove get there pens out lol.l old out of touch poor old foges with fuck all to do....... Yes that's who attemp to run our councils
Handforth PC Clerk woke up that day and chose violence
Fuck Jackie off the old battle axe
And these people make decisions in our communities, very sad really, my children behave better
Is Jackie Weaver really QAnon?
Holy flippin flip, retire already!
Best of British 🤣🤣
Cynthia needs to be chair. Only person willing to make decisions with two finely executed "NOs"
Jackie Weaver is a bully. She does not respect established laws and protocols. How she is being applauded after this shit show is beyond me.
This needs timestamps
Does anyone else think we should get an adaptation of this and have Jackie Weaver played by Jacki Weaver?
"A subcommittee of the steering group?" "No a subcommittee of the panningeshfkfhsgsdje" "No"  Wonder why your planning applications take so long people?  #committeesofcommittees
“We’re trying to have a teams meeting you FOOL”
5:48 that guy turns into Smeagol.
This is what technoblade would do
Why is this trending
Good job they are not face to face in a room hand bags at dawn
Just a bunch of bored, angry old duffers drinking too much coffee. Not much to see really.
This is beautiful!
Absolutely stunned by what the English, supposedly a funny people, think is amusing nowadays.
The guy on Aled's iPad looks and sounds like a Reece Shearsmith character.
Long may zoom meetings reign much easier to get rid of very obnoxious people
This should be a midsummer murders episode
Was Jackie actually the chairman? If not..that raises a few questions
We’re trying to have a teams meeting YOU FOOL
John smith just laughing at all the confrontation is me
Why do I feel like I know these people
Bloke with guitars. Alright mate so you’re a bit musical. Having to lean at an unnatural angle so you can get your face in but must show your instruments !
Can someone please explain what’s going on? 😂
Five minutes in and I'm not on Jackie Weaver's side
"And the wheel," said the Captain, "What about this wheel thingy? It sounds a terribly interesting project." "Ah," said the marketing girl, "Well, we're having a little difficulty there." "Difficulty?" exclaimed Ford. "Difficulty? What do you mean, difficulty? It's the single simplest machine in the entire Universe!" The marketing girl soured him with a look. "Alright, Mr. Wiseguy," she said, "if you're so clever, you tell us what colour it should be."  - Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.  These people would be on the same ship.
@0:06 “When do we plan to start?” *whispers under breath* “fuckoff” 😂
Women!Lol
A 18 minute expose of every British stereotype out there.  quite good fun~  You can see where JRR Tolkien got a lot of inspiration from
@handort Mr Herbert from southpark🤣
I think all council meetings should be recorded and on the internet, really if your local councillors or mp behaved like some of these people, I suspect your vote may well be given to another candidate.
This is like the British version of Chernobyl politicking.
Jackie Weaver actually did have the authority
Gollum at 6.00 - “I’m on a teams meeting - give me the ring!!”
The next meeting should be fun.
Clearly the one with the teams reigns supreme
Jackie learned from Big Tech: don’t need to be voted in just need to control the servers.
THEODEN: YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE JACKIE WEAVER!
I literally almost died at 7:11...  "Thank you Roger, yes, we will be--" "AHAHAHAHAHA!" "--we will be elaborating on that as well."
so this is why shit doesnt get done LOL amazing
Just hope none of these Muppets have bred ,middle class power crazed wannabes
Oh god it’s terrible! Why are they all talking over each other?!
lol Jackies a bit of a laugh they all seem nice just maybe tking themeselves bit 2 serious they should all get togther nd laugh life 2 short lol
No you cannnnnnt
school yard bullying at their age is laughable, fairplay to jackie weaver, woman of the people xx
The toilet flush at 7:12 🤣🤣
This is better than Game of Thrones...
I believe the word is 'coup'. A bit like watching Putin anointing puppet chairmen. Perhaps one of the first couple of chairs could boldly outflank her by learning to convene a zoom mtng.
All zoom meetings should began with someone asking 'when do we plan to start?' followed by a random muttered  'fu(k off'
I ship Sue with Member-Of-The-Public-Alan, the chemistry there is undeniable 💘
I lost it at 2:16 lmfao old codger got so angry
Will you stop being whatever it is your trying to be 🤣 I’m dead
Honestly I don’t know why I’m here or why this video has happened or the context
Thats’s illegal JACKIE!!!!
The next time someone questions my authority, I will interject and say, "You will refer to me as Britney Spears from now on."
Chairman: Mwhahahahahaha! You have no authority here, Jackie Weaver! Jackie: I shall draw you, Chairman, as poison is drawn from a wound!
John Smith so deserves to be a Clark!! He's just nervous, give him time. Fingers crossed for season two. Also love the plot twist of Jackie Weaver going from villain to hero
This needs to be a show...
It makes me proud to know that provincial management in our fair country in such outstanding order.
I love when he says "fuck off" at the start hahahaha
0:09 cheeky bugger gave himself the clerk title
16:13.  Oops
Read the standing orders! READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!!!
Jackie Weaver needs to named a Saint after all this!! 😂
For me the quiet fury of Peter Moore at beginning is telling. I also love his guitar collection lol.
Gandalf: “We’re trying to have a Teams meeting you fools!”  *Falls into the chasm at Khazad-Dum*
I think this is the funniest video I’ve ever seen. I can’t even begin to explain why I think it’s funny but it gets funnier every time I watch it.
Boomers
Can't wait for part 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yet more proof boomers shouldn't be in charge of anything. Shouldn't even be allowed to vote.
Why is this in my recommendations 😂😂😂
How are you meant to attend a meeting is a meeting isn’t happening?
"One of the Councillors from the west ward has missed 6 months of meetings.  The fact no meetings has been held in six months is irrelevant".   Most underrated line lol
"Please could Alan Murdoch be brought back into the meeting?" "Who is is Alan Murdoch, please?"  "Yes, please." Is underrated 😂
I’m laughing so hard I’m crying. I thought our govt was hilarious but y’all a damn TRIP and this comment thread is absolutely hysterical 😂😂 Really tho all govt is bad.
16.12 was a prediction and a half by the way, but there is no war of words, jackie weaver is a tyrant, read them and understand them
OMG THERE'S MORE ->>> https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCainybXnQGprt73RVXS6UGQ/videos  AND IT'S ALL BAADDDD
this is fucking funny
Jackie weaver is a tyrant, that is all
Yeah, those who's speak behalf of the lords name speak the most trash. 🤣
They’re all more concerned about their fictional capitalist statuses, than the subjects at hand. I’m embarrassed to be human.
The fast paced and heady world of local politics in Cheshire people. Wow could it get any more.... Fkin borin
I wanna know what happened last time
John Smith seems to be having a mischievous background, he was joining in with the laughing at Jackie Smith while still condemning the actions of the son and his dad.
Yes please. lol
Jackie Weaver is a Snowflake end of story!
i got 7 minutes in and i wanted to kill myself
I am literally in a big ass headache and confused to why tf this is on trending.
7:12   (evil sounds)
Seen plenty of examples like this at Union meetings and the worse committee meetings are Bowlers and Football clubs
Boomers and technology don't mix well.
Boomers and cat ladies.
This is mildly amusing. Not sure what the fuss is about.
Handforth PC clerk is on smoke
best thing to come out of this batshit town in years tbh
Barry Burkhill for Chairman
I've seen memes shitting on Jackie but... she seems the reasonable one
The comments section makes for as much entertainment as the video itself.  It amazes me that these people are paid for this? and from tax payers money? It absolutely boggles the mind - imagine a business meeting conducted in this fashion...  Having said that, it's a great pilot! When's episode 2 out?
“Rich coming from the chairman who hadn’t held a meeting since March to try and call this one illegal, the man is a complete disgrace”  “Ok thank you Peter”
I cant wait to see the sequel 😂
Why the nasty comment about Birkenhead?
That "fuck off" is absolutely perfect, as is the "quite rightly"  AND the "illegally" just thrown in too.
Has anyone got a copy of the standing orders so we can see who is right and who is wrong? I’m on Team Standing Orders.
Morning Sergeant
11:08 Rodger small I was looking and I was like gosh he is small. Then he came into frame.
ROGER SMALLS FOREHEAD
PETERS HAND
JULIES I PAD
This must be the most stupid meeting in the country if not the World. Arrogant, Disrespectful, Uneducated, Pointless, Waist of time. Shameful, Embarrassing. What is the possible reason for them to be in the room waisting electricity. Don’t tell me they have the power to spend money.
Fascinating. Our left-wing City Council here in Northern California is known for long, long sessions, enriched by blunt and noisy public comment, but council members themselves are rather polite (usually...). Perhaps Handforth is the Janey Godley voiceover of our meetings.
So many gold moments and then there's even an appearance from Gollum! 05:48
This is the power of zoom calls: you can boot people off who are unpleasant, rather than trying to physically remove people from council rooms who don't want to go!
I love the scream whispering. Like no one can hear that!
I was honestly waiting for Peter Moore to bust out his guitar 🎸
Jackie a tyrant
They need replace all of them, for yang professional people. 🤩
"You CAN'T! ... You have no authority here Jackie Weaver, no authority at all!"  Jackie quietly removes him. 😊
all this ancient make believe shite n panto play is why councils are fucking useless and a waste of money
Jackie a fucking jobs worth
Why is no one talking about the man who predicted this would go viral and Jackie then saying “it’s not going to be finished this side of Christmas”.   Nostradamus levels of predictions.
julie's i pad was the true clerk all along
So are we just going to ignore the demonic possession at 5:47 or...?
Obviously everyone here is pretty rude.  However was the chairman right in terms of law?  Without understanding the context here we could be witnessing an illegal takeover.  So Jacqui clearly is running the zoom session but I suspect here she has just taken over the meeting by excluding others.  However these guys might be awful.  Clubs can be just as toxic.
Why do I think of Monty Python when I see this? 😅
As a Vice Chair myself he was correct 😂
Ian coming in w the receipts
Alan's Ipad survived He was accidentally placed in the naughty room
What sort of name is Aled 😭
If you ask Alexa if Jackie Weaver has authority, Alexa will ask if you actually mean Britney Spears! 😂
I want the full thing
This is what I pay taxes for...? - A group of oldies having a barney!
WE STAN SUEEEE FOR RESPECT!!!!
Good work Roger, John, Sue and Cyn. The people at the beginning should be disgusted at their behaviour.
5:53 "We're trying to have a teams meeting you fool"        *is on zoom*
The cackle of John Smith at 5:06 is legendary 😂
Nobody is mentioning the amazing thumbnail that has professionally been put together 😭
On the 7th day god created Jackie weaver to vanquish the demons from the handforth parish council
Windows 95 graphics in the thumbnail 🤣
Is Apple sponsoring Handforth Parish Council (and ENVIRONS)?
Can’t believe this hasn’t been scripted by Armando Iannucci 😂
Unfortunately there are many little committees like this, Parish Councils, Resident Associations, where self important people of a certain generation who let positions go to their head rather than focus on representing communities appropriately.
I have to say  that Jackie Weaver reminds me of a younger Liz Smith
The mumbled fuck off is golden
yeah that's cool but what's the difference between a clerk and a proper officer?
‘Who is Alan Murdoch?’  ‘Yes please’
I went to a parish council meeting once. It was just as pathetic as this and everyone was in the same room. It was a load of pompous people just like this. They should be ashamed of themselves. Love the guy that sounds like something out of the Exorsist!
There seems to be a plot to oust the council chair. My guess is the clerk is operating the account intended for the chair in her own name while the chair has been assigned to clerks account. The clerk has the virtual powers that the chair should have. Also explains the strange name discrepancy i.e. the chair being called the clerk of the council. @8:04 laugh of guilt...? 7:23 for the beginning of the relevant bit.  The argument about the chair allegedly sending a message to everyone stating that he was becoming the clerk. That video suggests the opposite, rather that he was convinced of being the chair himself and that Jackie was assumed to be the role of clerk. Why on earth would he do such a thing and then behave in that way? Let me know what you think...
Why is Peter Moore so angry at the beginning of this?
I genuinely don't think I'll ever forget this, historic moment in UK history
People wanting their bit of power
Not sure if that was hilarious, or frightening!  A rollercoaster of emotions right now... Oh Dear! *fans face, sips tea*
Children children please! There are enough sweeties for everyone! This is a classic example of why I haven’t an ounce of respect for local councillors! All they do is massage their own ego’s!
Does David Lynch know about this?
Jackie Weaver must be stopped
Can anyone here explain why Jackie is getting so much praise for kicking a chairman out of a meeting for no reason?
We do not want a turf war breaking out...
Um Karen Um is that Um you Karen???????
Waiting for the 6 part Netflix documentary on this
I love the part when the guy in the background turns into Gollum xD
Yer man the "clerk" is a disrupter, an anarchist and is def a MAGA type
Is John smith Bradly Walsh? 😅
The toilet flush at 10.54😂😂😂 says it all about this meeting 😂
Does anyone know where I can get a Clerk of Handforth Parish Council badge?
Sue should be chairwoman, and Jackie the vice chairwoman!
😂😂 hearing that person in the background say “F*** O**” near the start made me laugh so much. 😂😂
5:20 lol
The panic in Vice Chair (Aled’s?) voice after the Chair gets booted is unreal.   It’s like he’s watching a skyscraper full of sick children toppling over onto a home for injured animals and there’s nothing he can do about it.   Sheer terror.
I feel like I am watching a trailer from  The Hobbit movie 🙄
This is absolute comedy gold. Funniest thing all Lockdown.  Thankyou HPC.
Hysterical
Boring, boring, boring ....
Best ipad commercial i've ever seen
Dolores Jackie Umbridge
The office
I suspect this is a meeting of people in advanced stage of Alzheimer’s. It’s rude of us to poke fun at this group of diminished octogenarians.
Did someone say ‘fuck off’ under their breath in the beginning?????? 😭😭😭😭😭😭
All my homies hate Birkenhead
Is Linda Blair in the meeting at around 5:50?  I am sure I can hear voices of an exorcised soul.  "YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY!"  CLICK!
what the fuck is going on here. it seems like its alot of time wasted on internal politics and alliances on the committee while seeking the head chair. this is nothing more than seeing kids in a playground bitching over pointless shit. prime example why all councils around the uk are laughing stocks.
The pompous old dinosaurs are hilarious
If only Richard Curtis had put this into The Vicar of Dibley.
Jackie is truly terrifying.
Clerk: challenge Jackie Weaver Jackie Weaver: So you have chosen death
This is Vicar of Dibley stuff. Where's Jim?
In May 2019 it would appear that there were a total of 13 candidates for the 7 available seats on the Handforth Parish Council and it was therefore a properly contested democratic election, unlike many parishes in England where unfortunately insufficient candidates put their names forward for the seats available. Every parish, district and county council has essential Standing Orders that all councillors and clerks should follow. It would appear that Jackie Weaver was asked by certain Handforth councillors to 'help' the council but in fact her presence was the equivalent of throwing a grenade into the room. As has been stated elsewhere Jackie Weaver had no authority to remove democratically elected councillors from the meeting. That could only be undertaken by following the correct procedure contained in the Standing Orders that would have been based on a vote by the councillors present. For someone, who I assume is in a well paid role within the local association of local councils, it would appear that Jackie Weaver has very little understanding of council procedures. By ejecting the Handforth Chair from a previous meeting and from this one she single handedly created this disastrous parish council meeting that has now gone viral. No wonder the Chair and Vice-Chair were furious, no matter the history behind the case. Democracy was not well served by this fiasco, however entertaining.
I love the muttered F off at the very start
Cyn is a misery faced party pooper
Middle class children playing at being grownups
It’s crazy how you can put 400 college students in a zoom room and it’s infinitely more civilized😂
Why has Jackie weaver been blocked? She just had an interview with sky news 🤣🤣🤣
Russia and China are only trotting after her
I was hooked from the first moments.
When do we plan to start... F off 🤣🤣🤣
We all wish we were John Smith sitting on the call laughing.
“When do we plan to start?”..... “Fuck off”
This makes my uni meetings look like the oval office.
Chairman - "When do we plan to start?"  Anonymous whisper - "FUCK OFF!" "
One can only imagine the email threads between this bunch
I bet their Christmas parties are fun.
DVD Chapters 6:06 Aled just wants to watch the world burn...
Now now, children, play nicely 😕
Can't wait for episode 2 !!!
Herdyn mě sem poslal. If žalud sees this we won zulul.
This is why nothing ever gets solved in these stupid meetings with all this pontificating nonsense
If 'politics can be fun to watch too' was a video
This is up the road from my house and it’s hilarious😂
Ladies and gentlemen, a fine display of your taxes at work. What a shambles.
If you enjoy Handforth Parish Council meetings, you will LOVE the infamous 'Troggs Tape' LOL....
In cinemas Summer 2021

Battle of the boomers
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!
How do ppl that seem to have animosity got to be together in the first place?
Too damn funny.
There is great miniature railway in Handforth! Well worth a visit!
Power mad little people x
Wherein we learn the proper pronunciation of "clark." Thank you mother England.
I love how the whisperers are just positive they are 100% stealth.
little britain......burocratic little toads, no wonder nothing gets done.
Gollum makes an appearances
This doesn’t even seem real omfg!
Does anyone else have the Sex Pistols roaring around in the back of your head?
Black tea is a gateway drug to Robert's Rules of Order.
Golem at 6:00 lol
Jokes aside, she cannot remove people just because wants to and can. If it was not a virtual meeting, you cannot throw out people because you want to
Takeaway: He whoeth is Zoom master rules all the world.
Jackie: "We did as you may recall put the disruptive members into the waiting room."  #strong
Seems like “um “ & “uh” are  a staple part of the community 😂😂
Hands up if you haven’t a clue what this meeting was about. That’s 18 minutes and 9 seconds of my life I’m not getting back 😂😂😂
i hate cyn
Bunch of snob crazy disrepectful appalling people😌
https://youtu.be/BWfGxEWru1U
Did he say F off at the start!?
Does anyone else want to watch Hot Fuzz after seeing this?
Need Miss Marple to sort this one out!!
When did Gollun join the meeting?
I've read the standing orders, and Cllrs. Brewerton, Burkhill and Tolver actually do appear to be in breach on standing orders 4.10; 4.11; 4.12; 4.13iii and 10(A). Perhaps they should "READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!"  Handforth Parish Council Standing Orders (19/06/2019): 4.10 You must promote and support high standards of conduct when serving as a Member of the council, by leadership and example, championing the interests of the community.   4.11 You should uphold the law and, on all occasions, act in accordance with the trust that the public is entitled to place in you.   4.12 You must treat others with courtesy. You should engage with colleagues and staff in a manner that underpins mutual respect and courtesy, essential to good local government.   4.13 You must not:          (iii) bully any person, including other Members, officers of the council or members of the public   10 Disorderly conduct A No person shall obstruct the transaction of business at a meeting or behave offensively or improperly.
The best opening to a meeting ever: "When do we plan to start?" "Fuck off"
By God this is jam packed with absolute gems
I love the quiet guys who suddenly burst out laughing or shout FACK OFF
The greater good...
Just watched the first 2 minutes. The level of animosity and aggression in the meeting is horrible, and that's before it even starts. Decided not to watch any more because I found the level of toxicity emanating from this video was having a quite an effect - painful and depressing.. YUK!
Went from carol basking to Jackie weaver
Probably the greatest political drama I’ve ever seen, thick of it - no, house of cards - never. The twists the turns, the drama, love it!
This is great, my grandmother used to live in Handforth.
And people say Capitol Hill was the most dramatic power struggle of 2021...
Bunch of geriatric 1st graders, seriously, no different than watching my youngest child's bullshit online schooling, especially when the teacher steps out.
Can we get Dexy's midnight runners to do a jackie weaver remix 😉
I'd love to see the transcript for the chat on this zoom call 😅
That cyn is a spoil sport, Jesus
ALED IS THE UNSUNG HERO HERE!!!!
If you watch the whole meeting you see she was totally at fault. She lied that the chair was planning to stop the meeting, and that she had to kick him out to stop him doing that. Yet there is nothing to support her dishonest claim. Then she undermines the democracy of the meeting by kicking out people that she disagrees with, so that any decisions made are not reflective of the full views. Then to try and excuse her totally overstepping her minute taking role, she tries to make out that she was a victim of sexist behaviour, when she was the one who totally stopped a man from talking, without him even having the chance to say what, as chair, he wanted to say. Judging by the number of self satisfied interviews she has since given she is a frustrated nobody desperate for attention and loving being in the limelight, and trying to turn attention away from her incompetence in ruining a meeting. Let's hope she is banned from attending meetings, to prevent further self publicising activities by this odious person.
You should have seen the chaos at last year's oddly shaped vegetable competition.
5:30 the most delightful utterance of "SUBPOENA" you will ever hear
5:18 Perfect Laugh!
jokes
That "chairman" is an arsenal hole
BA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA What is this? HA HA HA HA HA
So, the people in the beginning may have been rude but I believe they were bringing up legitimate points.
11:24  Who is Alan Murdoch please?  Yes please!  AHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAKSJAJAHAHAJANHHJ. YOU COULDN’T WRITE THIS!
Are we ready to start...   Fuck off.  Sets the tone perfectly,   Only good thing to happen in 2020, you have no authority
Some people take the role seriously and rightly so, I cannot see why a clerk can decide who should speak even on a Parish council there are rule which don't seem to be followed
Epitome of British Parish Council meetings
The audible toilet flush at around 7:15 is a masterstroke.
“I think if this goes viral on the internet it will start a war of words” @16:13   David Pincombe has better vision than Iniesta🤣
5:49 Gollum, you doing OK?
Sorry I've come into this half way through, where's Inspector Barnaby? Do we know who did it yet? My money is on John Smith, it's not Aled too obvious surely?
Oh this is a bit sad really .....after the wonderful work Captain Tom Moore did to promote the importance of the role of older people’s voice in society some of the men in positions of responsibility at Handforth Parish Council just reinforce the stereotypes.
Too many commenters don't know the difference between having authority to dismiss and the technical ability to censor.
The fact that the folk on this ere video have even the smallest amount in of authority within British society ..  is a concern.
@ 10 seconds. The Sly F@ck off 🤣 Who is flushing the Loo?@ 7:11🤣 The Fact, no meetings were held is irrelevant🤣 You haven't been to Handforth often enough🤣 Bless every one of them. Legends🤣
We should disband the UN and put these fellas in charge of the whole thing
i came to this video to see if theirs comments about the thumbnail
Pathetic representation of the community
David pincombe foreshadowed this 😂
The councillor missed six months meetings. The fact that there were no meetings held is irrelevant 😂🤣😂
Somebody clipped up the sequel to this meeting: https://youtu.be/AU9fqj3MGCw 👍👍🤣
This is very British.
Wtf is this. Seems like an office style parody 😂
Idiots
Why did she boot them out rather than just mute them?
This is why nothing ever gets done in any council anywhere in England.
Jackie Weaver, straight up gangster 😎 🤘
You can see Jakie's hubris from space.
Julie's I Pad and whoever says "Here comes the subpoena!" are clearly Reece Shearsmith from The League of Gentlemen Zoom-bombing.
It's not bullying
She's a right cow
What ever that was from Aleds iPad at 5:49 sounded like the meeting had descended into demonic possession! 😱
Julie's iPad
Stoneybridge
Ah so that's where my taxes went.
16:20 Foreshadowing!
Everytime I watch this I have a new favourite quote.
An example of bullying and how not to behave.  Jees
Neanderthal men
If this is what all council meetings are like no wonder nothing ever gets done
C
"You have no authority Jackie Weaver" Jackie Weaver "Does that give you power over me???" "You're not in charge!!!" Jackie Weaver "Do you feel in charge??"
The meeting was about the blight of the living statue.
OMG I just watched a video where Aled's breakdown at 5:43 has been turned into Gollum form LOTR 🤣🤣🤣
We don't want a turf war breaking out pmsl!
the clerk of the parish council sounds like Baron Greenback from Dangermouse
I can't get over the name John Smith, the most generic British name ever.
This is more intense than game of thrones red wedding
So funny lol. They should all be on the Telly lol
not the toilet flush at 7:11 😭
What a nightmare lol
Tonight's motion:- 'Handforth Parish Council vs Handforth Parish Council'  🧐🤪🤐😎🤣
Poor Jackie...
John Smith is the true neutral we all need, but don't have.
5:57 Did Gollum enter the chat?
lol you can feel the anger between them. kinda funny and wholesome to see old people fighting
love pete’s background
Um, what the uhm? Are these um, people um, actually uhm? Um, are they adults? Do they um have any idea, uhm, how to hold a meeting. Uhm? Who is on the uhm Committee uhm and uhm are they legally uhm going to GET ON WITH IT! What a sh*t show. Oh and I am the real Britney Spears by the way #JustSoYouKnow
Wow these guys run things ,what a bunch of knob heads
Staring roles   Trisha Paytas as Jackie Weaver Jeffree Star as “Handforth Pc Clerk”  Shane Dawson as Aled’s iPad  Ryland Adams as unnamed guy via Aled’s iPad Hair by Jay as Barry Burkill
This was better without the subtitles - really nice compliation but I'm sure there were no subtitles yesterday? :)
What a sad waste of public funding!!
The moment they said it would be easy to alter the constitution they made an enemy of America. Hanford Parish prepare for war!
JOIN THE DOTS UP FUNNY HOW THIS HAS GONE VIRUL IN THESE TIMES OF BULLSHIT CULLING DONT TAKE ME FOR NO FOOL
The old boy is right he’s stating facts
Old ppl just vibing between themselves.
IF THIS HAS NOT BEEN STAGED FOR DEEPER PYOP DARKER MEANING AS A MEAN TO AN END THEN THEY HAVE JUST FELL FOR A PYOP OPPERATION TO GAIN FREEDOM OF SPEECH LAWS SO TO PUT OUT THAT IF YOU CAUSE INJURY AND NO REMERDY THEN IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE THE PUPPET MASTERS WILL USE THIS AS A SPRING BOARD TO TAKE AWAY YOUR LAST MEANS OF HUMAN CONTACT AND IF IT IS ORGANIC IN ANYWAY THEN IT IS AND HAS BEEN USED FOR THE MASTERS GAIN AS ABOVE TALK ABOUT A PISS UP IN A BREWREY AND THIS IS HOW THE HOUSE OF PAL GO ON BEING INBREDS STILL GOOD FOR A LAUGH WHILE YOU DO WHAT YOU ARE TOLD SO THIS IS ARE ENTERTAMENT FOR THE NEW NORMEL FUCK OFF JUST LIKE THE FREEMASON SAID LIE IS JUST ALL BUT A STAGE SO I SAY TAKE HEED AND STOP WALKING THE PLANK GO ON AND GODBLESS
Jackie weaver sure it isn’t Karen Weaver 😂😂😂😂
0548 to 0600 Demon gets Exorcised followed by Gollum then Smeagol. You FOOL ! Perfection.
There are many good reasons why I do not live in the UK any longer...the outstanding contender is this unbelievable performance. Hideous old blokes stuffed with pomposity who's principal beef is that that they have lost control. Nasty and horrible.
Wot a shit show
The best of English.
quite strange they never really made any decisions.  What a disgrace.
That Aled chap is such a lunatic!
Has Jackie read the rules ?
I just love the complete meltdown at Aled's 🤣
Better than any script from the office, if zoom meetings were a regular occurrence, back then...comedy gold with a true villain.
🤣hilarious
A cross-section of some of the worst the English have to offer up. It's not the hoodies you need to worry about, it's these jumped up dicks with too much time on their hands.
https://youtu.be/S4aquqAZs-E
Take a shot every time Jackie Weaver says: "um"
How can we watch the next one? I have a feeling the sequel will be even better.
No Zoom meeting of a council would be complete without a toilet flush, a "f@%k off" and a recommendation for a Subcommittee of the Committee.
Power corrupts, and as demonstrated in Handforth absolute power corrupts absolutely 🤣🤣🤣
I think the Met need to send Simon Pegg and Nick Frost down from Sanford to Handforth. These lot need sorting out by sgt Nicholas Angel.
Ganging up on the token Londoner at 11:58 🤣
new concept for a UK Reality TV show: Get 8 old people to agree on the colour of the carpet
Lockdown has driven everyone mad.
I want to know when the Alderman is joining the Zoom...Kiss the Alderman, Kiss the Alderman, Kiss the Alderman!
btec game of thrones
“Councillor Burkill, we’ve been through this...” 😂
IM PISSING MYSELF
Why is no one talking about the toilet flushing in the background
Jackie Weaver I am the senete 😂.
Brexit pales into insignificance after watching this.
Who was it that called Julie? Will we find out in part 2? Stay tuned!
Do they actually get anything done !!! Hilarious!!! 😂 from a fellow scouser!!! *you're muted!!!
I've worked in a local council in North London and it's true that many of the higher-ups are a bunch of pathetic children throwing tantrums. Lots of good people too, but it would have been great if we'd been able to mute the idiots like Jacki did here
When are they meeting next? I want to watch live
‘I didn’t make a chance to a make a comment as I was on the naughty step’  ‘Is there any room on it?’   ‘Not anymore, no 😂’    This is golden 😂
‘Sorry, I didn’t realise I was disruptive, I was being muted, how can I be disruptive when I was muted? 😂’  ‘You’re always disruptive’   ‘Only when I’m looking at you 😂’
'Will you stop being, whatever it is, you're trying to be'   I need this on a T-shirt
I am Julie. The minute meetings get out of hand. I shift for meself 😂
I love democracy.
And this type of small minded petty twat are the ones making important decisions in every town in our country, no wonder town centres are dying and stupidity reigns.
Team Jackie Weaver. Click 'Like'. 🔥
They need the Vicar of Dibley. This is gonna get Midsomer murders
'We're trying to have a Teams meeting you Fool' said like some demon😂
0:21 Encourages people to switch off their microphones probably because somebody has muttered f.ck off 🤣
im literally confused at the 18 minutes i spent watching this it starts when Jackie Weaver goes full on tinpot dictator removing the chairman and after that it goes off the deep end to which im left feeling lost as to what i was witnessing.
The I ironic thing is this is the group of people who dicide if you can have your shed or not! The talk in Hollywood is thay are planning a version of west wing...the Hanford parish council episodes....explosive stuff Thanks to pandemic thay have been exposed! We knew all long.....just needed the proof! It will be same in every council in uk  Comedy gold cant stop watching
Typical woke hijacking of democracy.
This is mainly just a bunch of old people trying to use technology, but badly.
CLASSIC OLD MAN ON ZOOM
...why am i here?
A Britney Spears impersonator, a man speaking in tongues, Julie’s I Pad, this video has everything I never knew I wanted.
"Yes Please"
John Smith for office!
What a shower of fannies.
PLEASE JOIN MY BAGUETTE FAMILLY!!! IT WOULD MEAN THE WORLD TO ME <3
Petition for this year's "I'm A Celebrity" to just feature members of Handforth Parish Council
😳
You have no authority here Jackie Weaver
Holy fuck, that was ~ T E N S E ~
I think Jackie wants more control than she really has....   When they go back to normal meetings me thinks Jackie will be voted out 😂
The Struggle is Real 😂😂😂💁🏼‍♀️🥳
What a disgrace and embarassement.....is it any wonder our youth of today behave the way they do given these people as role models.....should be so embarrassed with yourselves...
The low quality, low angel camera, mics cutting out, random background noises...the fact that it's its so inconsequential but they act like it's a COBRA meeting. The Boomerness of it. Outstanding.
6:04 Emperor Palpatine has entered the chat
Haven't got a brain cell between them....frightening to think these people have  a say over your town... Wow!
Please refer to me as BrItNeY sPeArS from now on 😂😂😂😂😂
Like Lord of the Flies with pensioners...
Anyone else confused 😀
this is the whitest thing I've ever seen XD
how did i end up here watching this?
John Smith: (tentatively) Can...we... make this recording...available? YouTube: Yes
Rumour has it that the actual meeting has still not started
FIRST TIME SOMEBODY BECOMES #2 ON TRENDING TAHT IS NOT FAMOUS PROBABLY
To explain for anyone overseas, Parish Councils here usual discuss village footpaths that have slightly overgrown hedges, if the village hall needs a new sign, local dog waste bins, anyone parking their cars inconsiderately, a possible new bench for the park, etc.
The most generic name imaginable: John Smith 😭
Parish committee just a bunch of busy bods
I’ve watched this 4 times now and it gets funnier each time 🤣😂
This is deffo how Americans see us English😂😂😂😂.
Middle England at its best. No filmmaker could do it better .
Last week we were all waiting for Bridgerton S2, now we just want The Parish Counsel!
Sue asking for everyone to be respectful to Jackie weaver and Aled’s iPad laughing in her face is a very underrated moment
Wonderful haha
I can see Julie Waters playing a part in a the play of this
“We trying to have a Teams meeting you fool!l pmsl
I have tears of laughter rolling down my cheeks. Even the truly amazing and much missed Victoria Wood could not have invented anything as hilarious as this. Thanks for posting the edited highlights..I don't think my sanity would have survived the full version intact. Meanwhile Jackie Weaver is the Dorian Gray of pop music...just don't ever sing this to Aled Jackie https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-u5WLJ9Yk4
Brewerton at 5.50 throwing the biggest hissy fit is bloody hilarious.  Ooh he sounds like a right charmer NOT!!
It was doomed when the Chair didn't take control from the begining. He shouldn't have let anyone to clerk the meeting without his permission. Why on earth did he allow the meeting to take place if he considered illegal?
“Turf war” 😳
I'm glad these people are not part of the EU anymore.
This shit happens ALL the time. The Thick of it was a documentary.
Did Smeagle enter this teams meeting at 5:49?!
Why is this #2 trending?
YOU HAVE NO POWER HERE JACKIE WEAVER
This should be a tourist advert for Britain
How are these people and why is this trending?  I watched the video and I'm confused why people think it's funny ? Am i missing something?
MEHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!
Good council
Love her
Pahahaha. I heard all about this on Jeremy Vine. This is too funny.
If this doesn't get a BAFTA then Britain is truly broken. I need a sequel - and a prequel - IMMEDIATELY!!
She is on it with the technology
David knew this was going viral lol
Lol
Barry Burkhill king of stating the obvious. “The chairman of the council is..... the chairman of the council”. What a genius. Glad he is serving.
The sad thing is, everywhere you look in this country there are complete nutjobs like this making decisions affecting millions of peoples lives...Comedy Gold? A tragicomedy for sure
as deatheater: "we're trying to have a teams meeting you *fool* "
I'll take youths over this lot any day
This is the new Tiger King!
They should all resign with immediate effect.
I wonder will these parish councillors either get relected to their posts once an election comes or decide to go for a higher office like a parliamentary seat for instance
Karen’s , all of them 🤯 and these people are meant to be in control of stuff ? , absolute disgusting breed of people
Bruh who is the wrong in this? Is Jackie Weaver abusing her power? I’m confused. xD
Bloody love these comments also. 😂 Literally crying with laughter.
John Smith is underrated
"Could I ask you to be respectful to Jackie Weaver please?" "HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
give it another 30 years and we will eventually have some clued up ppl in charge when dealing with technology.
The guy on the left on Aled's i pad reminds me of the ghastly Derek Hatton who was emperor of Liverpool in the 1980s
4:24: My phone asking me to accept the Terms and Conditions
5:46 - Gollum has entered the Zoom meeting.
These people are horrid
Could Alan Murdoch be brought back into the meeting? Who is Alan Murdoch? Lol
this like something out of the thick of it😂😂
DOWN WITH THIS SORT OF THING!  :-)  That was just ridiculously funny.  NO-ONE talked about anything!  How can you do that for so long?!  Does anyone know what the meeting was about?
This gets funnier the more I watch it.
Julies I pad is the true star of this zoom!!!!
Chairman: “You have no authority here Jackie Weaver, no authority at all!” Jackie Weaver: CLICK  ❌ 😏
If you're going to pronounce it clArk then spell it that way FFS! #SMH #EnglishOrthographySucks
I don’t know why, but when it comes up on the screen as Julie’s IPAD it cracks me up 🤣
Over-hyped, actually quite boring. Like listening to paint dry.
"you have no authority here At...alll!! ..................................................... ......................................................  lol lol lol
My favourite part 13:31 😂
I need the full version because wow this is shakespearian 🎭😂
Absolute gold. Thank you so much! 😂😂
Peter Moore will be doing his Britain’s got talent audition later. He can play 3 guitars simultaneously
I understand the first six minutes is abuse - but what are they talking about over the ensuing 12 minutes?!  Perhaps the editing muddied the waters.
18:09 of not worth the bother
Priceless, just brilliant, vicar of Dibley after the watershed, the chair and vice compete loon buckets , so funny 😂😂😂
5.45 the deputy councillor sounds possessed 😂😂🤣🤣🤪🤣🤣
READ THE STANDING ORDERS!!!!!
Does Jackie Walker have any authority? Other than controlling the meeting buttons. It seems pretty odd to have a secretary eject the chairman.
Better than the council meetings of King's Landing
Jackie Weaver Vs Jordan Peterson. It's the debate we've all been waiting for.
I love this. So incredibly British.
‘We don’t want a turf war breaking out’ lmao
Wait. So one person got into trouble for not attending meetings that were never held?
Dont mess with the person who arranged the meeting, they can kick you out!! Haha
‘You have no authority here, Jackie Weaver’ Jackie Weaver: I’m about to end this whole man’s career.
Myanmar's government is more stable than this
That thumbnail gave me a stroke
were trying to have a team meter hereeeeeeeeee!!!! x3
Geriatrics can't use a laptop let alone run a small village 😂
Can I vote ronnie pickering onto this committee
There are so many layers to this, it's fantastic. From the 'fuck off' at the beginning, to the video itself being 240p. I'm in hysterics watching this, thank you for uploading.
HAHAHAHA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5nCijyuWiM Another example.
😂😂
What a load of drivel
This really has made my day thankyou i needed a good laugh
So this is a parish council meeting is it, shocking, sack them all, Idiots
“Coming from you in Birkenhead that sounds good”.  Magic. Muddle. Confusion. Insults. Chaos. Who deleted the Chairman? In the library, with the lead piping?
Number 1 on trending LMAOOO
Why is there no one below the age of 50 😩
Did they agree upon anything, to get anything done?
Someone needs to do a thug life on this
Definitely my favourite episode of The Vicar of Dibley
Hilarious and worrying at the same time. Then again its as I expected and I'm not really surprised .I've lived in that area and to think we pay for those jumped up balloons to make decisions is beyond a joke. People that should be nowhere near technology or a council position. Vote for Julies i pad!  :)
Old people using technology is hilarious.
Is it only me who watched this and thought it was a scripted pilot for a comedy sitcom? It’s so hilariously dis-functional and horrible. I cannot believe that these are grownups discussing local politics, especially the men. The old crusties at the start are horrible men.
I am here to start a war of words and also a turf war.
I was here at 1000 views
Are they gonna get their own TV interview and milk this like the four lads in jeans.
Brexit explained in 18 minutes.
"welcome to handforth"
Just goes to show how some people can make themselves so important, backfiring into hilarity LOL.
USA coup: Storm the captial building  UK coup: change your name to clerk
“WE’RE TRYING TO HAVE A TEAMS MEETING YOU FOOL”  Like Voldemort talking to Wormtail
EVIL SOUNDS  This is amazing!
This is legit what older people are like in England, full of rage with absolutely nothing to say.
That Jackie Weaver is an absolute bully. Fancy talking and treating a senior citizen like that, disgraceful behaviour
This was roughly what happened in the EU with its vaccines programme.
“You have no power here, Jackie weaver” Jackie: “now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”
This is why i am not on councils ptas ect... but this should be put on tv bedt comedy ever
Game of Thrones, Handforth edition.
5:49, Joe Pesci is vowing to get his ownback
Wow what a bunch of insufferable *words I probably should not write*. Jackie has the patience of a saint, bless her ❤
I think lockdown has gone to these guys head.... appalling behaviour!!!! Well Done to Jackie...good for you.....
I think lockdown has 0
This is literally a jerryatric discord mod dispute
Councillors! Does it exemplify what most residents think of them?
The History of the decline and fall of the Chairman of the Hanforth Empire
I didn’t know John Smith was a real person
"Read the standing orders... READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!!"
The Vicar of Dibley should make a new episode inspired by this.
Gollum joins meeting at 5:48
Whenever I die on Warzone: "Severe lag on the system!"
Julie being completely out of order. She does not let ppl talk, talk over ppl and clearly cant stop or kick chairman.
The first two lines of dialogue does it for me, as i do that at work.
Can't stop watching it. It's the funniest thing I've seen in a long time. I was having a crap day until I saw this 🤣🤣🤣
Jackie Weaver is the worst person. You know she was the meeting host and always will be  Absolute control freak, doesn’t listen to anyone, throws people out as she sees fit, interrupts everyone... nah hate her  Get her out
lmao this is what happens when u give tech to old ppl 😂🐐
Straight to the gulag
I want to know what issue they are actually trying to solve...if only the govt were this passionate lol
This is probably the first video number 1 trending that is in 240p quality in about 11 years.
We've always known this about them, here in God's Favourite, Cheshire West.
What a bunch of utter jobsworths.
Frankly they might as well remove all other videos on YouTube. This is the only video we need. And Julie’s iPad agrees.
And that children, is how technology can be used to overturn democracy.
Are these people getting paid for this ?
This is the casting for UK house of cards.
" we don't want to create tension"  Proceeds to ask if they can made the video public. 🤣🤣🤣
This is why u don’t vote labour
Should do wonders for the house prices in Handforth!
8:04 devilish laugh coming from Jackie here
I think Jackie Weaver speaks for us all when she says, "I have never seen such a strongly worded letter from a Monitoring Officer to a Local Council. 25 years - I've never seen anything like it."  John Smith's deadbeat reply: "You've not been to Handforth often enough!"  It's funny because it's so true!
Art
Boomers: Kids these days have no respect.  Also Boomers:
The chairman of the council is the chairman...of the council. 🤔
cant wait for the prequel of this masterpiece! rs rs
Hours long meeting. Nothing happens. No content. Yeah, typical video conference during the pandemic.
Oh my this is gold
All you talking about a ‘Jackie Weaver’ when the real hero here is clearly ‘Britney Spears’
God bless you Jakie Weaver
Don’t know who is legally right or wrong on this situation but the  “chair/clerk” and the “vice chair” we’re just disgraceful.
Um, Jackie Weaver, um ....
Si ce rahat e asta ?
6:03 is emperor Palpatine, right? Surely it's actially Emperor Palpatine...
Has no-one here ever said anything stupid and cringe-worthy?  Can you imagine that moment being video-ed and going viral so that the whole world can laugh at you?  Can you imagine for just ONE MINUTE what the people in this video are feeling this morning?  Of course they are being idiots.  But for pity's sake - stop sharing this.   It is nothing but cruel.
40 years ago this could have been a Monty Python sketch.
Roger Small talks like Glen from The Thick Of It
It’s kind of adorable that Jackie refers to Britney Spears like she’s still current 🥺
British people in a nutshell 😆
Ok zoomer
Can't see the funny side of this. These muppets are spending public money and making decisions affecting people. This crap is going on all over the country. Pathetic.
I wanna know why this got number 1 trending, football matches, fashion YouTubers,  and all sorts of celebrity video, and we get a parish council video.
I LIVE IN HANDFORTH BLOODY HELL
Boomer fighting each other lol
6:03 he sounds like if Anton Lesser played Gollum
Proof that there is no relation between age and wisdom.
Why is this trending?
5:47 - Homeboy went full Gollum. Being vice chairman must be his precious
This is tax payers  money well spent if you want to see a comedy show
Bloody boomers
Why did the one guy turn into Satan ? 😂😂
16:19 “I think if this goes viral on the um on the internet Facebook whatever “ 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think Jackie  weaver needs to be arrested and charged with unlawful conduct of removing legally appointed representatives. Unfortunately if nothing happens we have betrayed all those that have died for this country
Ian being so pleased with himself when he says he has a photograph of the chairman’s name on zoom is my favourite
Although funny at beginning..what a lot of hot air. No wonder things take so long. Just get on with it and stop talking bullshit
#1 on trending... 🤣
The most underrated part of this entire video is "one of the councillors did not attend a meeting for 6 months... The fact that there were no meetings held is irrelevant"  Honourable mention to Aled's iPad's gollum impression
This is excruciating
I've had a chance to reflect on this, surely  JW should've muted Julie's iPad when she took a call. Julie's iPad was clearly a Zoom novice. After that it descended into chaos. Questionable hosting skills there JW. I'm still #teamjackie though
I need to move to handforth
Peter Moore the real hero here
“who is alan Murdoch” “yes please”
This helps explain why the UK looks like such an unplanned mess, despite complex planning applications and building regulations. What a sad little country.
John Smith appears to be in a concrete bunker.
Jackie Weaver  Take your L
pov: you came here from trending
This has been best "TV"for a long time
“Could Alan  Murdock be brought in to the meeting please”  “Whose Alan Murdock?”  “Yes please”
The new star wars films look amazing
Maybe these stubborn old gits should stop barking at women then they can take part in their utterly meaningless little club
...And finally, Jackie Weaver blocked herself, and all was quiet.
Absolute gold. Note how some cannot help smacking others over the head with the rulebook, even when they seem to be dead wrong. The lesson: make sure you really do know the rules inside out so you can demolish idiots/those channelling satanic forces if you have to.
Chairman: You can’t kick me out! The Chairman has left the chat... Literally
on a serious note, these people are making decisions for their town!! worrying.
good to know taxpayer money is going towards comedy
'We don't want a turf war', oh chairman, a parish council is always a turf war!
Very funny. Any chance of making this a regular viewing
The Chairman is actually Winnie the Pooh
Jackie weaver was on a power trip
“We’re trying to have a teams meeting you fool!” That man has severe issues and sounded like he was speaking in tongues before his melt down
Is this British communication culture? Oh my gosh.
Bless her, she dealt with that very well
Number -1 on trending what!!!!
I work as an archivist with local authority records. I have to meet committees like this every other day and I can assure you this is not an isolated incident. The disrespect, bullying and sense of entitlement is real.
This has to be turned into a Netflix series!
Wankers, one and all!
Can you imagine being married to one of these blokes that's been booted off. I bet they do nothing but moan about this Parish Council! Their wives are the real heroes!  This is what happens when you retire, nothing to do except local politics 😉
Nice to see democracy in action duly administered by a cross-sectoon of the current British public...
It is awful behaviour . They need coaching.  You’d start with 1-2-1 and then slowly explain each point of view.. trying to bring some consensus. Mbti would help. I’m not sure if they have the desire to change. Adkar. Make them aware, create some desire for change x
Suddenly an episode of Midsomer Murders becomes much more feasible.
This is the second meeting they had that evening. The first one - which was the one that actually started at 7 - can be found here https://youtu.be/Q-JYna5dOEo
Cyn just shoots down everything that Sue says, doesn't she?
5.48 Gollum angrily accuses man of stealing his Handforth PC Clerk title
5:48 When did Gollum become a parish councillor?!
Why is there a council planning meeting on yt trending with 2.3 million views in a day
This is hilarious but honestly they should be ashamed of themselves, they should know better than to conduct themselves so unprofessionally, if they behaved like that anywhere else they’d be lucky to still have a job at the end of it.
These men have never heard of using by their inside voice.
This is why councils need more young staff
You ARE the weakest link. Good bye!!!
Pathetic petty politics, some of these people should be ashamed of themselves!
Absolutely disgraceful and unprofessional, all should be sacked. I have never heard or seen such a waste of tax payers money. You should all hang your heads in shame. No wonder it takes forever for anything to happen!!!!
The misogyny drips off the screen 🥰🤗 we love to see it 😑
I didn’t know staged season 3 was out already
And we have morons like this up and down the country running councils
Only 1 thing makes people act so vindictive  ££££££££ sex
"...stop being whatever you are trying to be!...That's great advice for them all (except Jackie bless her)
Adults behaving worse than kids. I wouldn't trust any of these people to get anything done, but serve there own ego... Especially Jacki Weaver!
What a bunch of Idiots, to think these muppets are incharge of a parish council🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Barry Burkhill’s dramatic silent backwards facing entrance is everything 😭
Bruh this has gone viral woah!
Jacki Wheaver is the only bully in this meeting. She can call herself Britney if she wants, but I would probably call her out for her bullying instead.
Well can see which people where the problem in this council. 2nd Tuesday in January.   C U NEXT TUESDAY,  then.
This is amazing. I may watch the extended edition.
Julie’s Ipad for chair 🪑💪🏼
Getting hot fuzz vibes of this lot!!
The gollum guy reminds me of Reece thingy off off league of gentleman and inside number 9
I once went to a National Students Union Conference, and it was just like this...for 2 days!  It is peeps like this that run the country :) cracks me up
"Please refer to e as Brittany Spears from now on." Iconic.
Old lad at 03:17 is my role model. That is the way to approach these Zoom meetings. Looking at anything else!
These people need to take courses on how to use the tech properly, and to mute themselves each time they finish speaking.
17:04 “can we make a recording available...that’s if you want to be bored shh...” Oh John smith. You hero.
8 secs in Chairman: 'When do we plan to start'? Unknown: 'Fuck off!' It wasn't going to get any better after that. Or so I thought.
How is this real 🙈 it’s like every experience melted in to one
Please Handford!.. make this a weekly series!!..  People would come!.. 🤣🤣🤣
Don't these people know that 1000's of people are dying ?  They are pathetic. Sack them all and start again.
Jackie weaver is watching
“Who is Alan Murdock?” “Yes please”......
Can we refer to Alan’s iPad as Roy Hodgson yet?
@ 5.50 Jackie Weaver expels demons .. 😱🤣🤣 @16: 24 Merlin ups the game by predicting the future.. 😱🤣🤣
I don’t normally comment twice, the words “turf war”, were spoken at a parish council meeting and it has made my life.
"Appalling behaviour."
My mother lived in Handforth for many many years and this 'meeting' is exactly as expected in a place that cannot agree on anything, anywhere, anytime.
14:18 who dat? A voyeur?
12:31 Jonny Marr from The Smiths.
Best video ever!
It's funny I sat on a parish council for 6 months a few years ago. Worst mistake. In my first meeting they spent 20 minutes debating whether or not someone should be granted permission for a 2 storey extension to their house. I thought they were going to refuse it, but it turned out they had no authority to refuse it anyway, only the district council could do that. So why were they debating it for 20 minutes? Every meeting was like that. Honestly they have no powers at all, I don't see why they even bother meeting. As one of my friends at the time bluntly put it - it's just elderly people looking to pass some time on the way to the grave.
I did not expect to be so thoroughly entertained by this, I need more.
Who says “f*** off” right at the start???
Right, we need to make a Hot Fuzz styled movie out of these people...
Whats really happening here
What is going on on Aled’s iPad?!?
Makes me feel better about my own country... this is worse than many third world countries, including mine.
what a joke. These people are so mismatched and are so unable to even converse at a basic level that they should resign. what a disgrace to their community.
Brilliant!
Read the standing orders .. READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!!! HAHAHHAHAHAAAAAAA
5:48 What’s with fucking Gollum over there?
Unbelievable
THE GREATER GOOD.
I saw the 1.5-hour video Handforth Parish Council video on a message board, and thought it was hilarious. I wanted to share it, but realised people would be put off by the video length, so I made a shortened version.  The media wanted to know where it had come from & why. I have told the truth when asked, yet every report on the subject seems to get it wrong in some way or another, in some there's almost no resemblance to fact at all. It's been a fascinating insight into the media machine.  Some people are getting obsessive over this & badgering two particular teenagers who helped the video get popular. These are teenagers. Much like me, they had nothing to do with the original meeting, so go easy on them, this whole thing is overwhelming.  The focus should be on the video itself, the bullying shown in a meeting that's paid for by taxpayers, and demonstrates how offputting getting involved with local politics can be. Behind the jokes, there's a sad reason this has resonated so much.  I hope those involved in the video are handling their fame/infamy OK. At this point, they've been turned into caricatures, with no intention for any of this to be so public. I know nothing about them personally, but do know that they are humans with lives of their own.
What a bunch of elitist snobs.
Such cry babies
Why do people find this funny?
I really want Legal Eagle to brush up on his knowledge of English Parish Council law so we can get his take on this.  Is there a difference between Clerk and Proper Officer?  Does Jackie Weaver have any power there?  When can points of order be raised?  We need to know!
Peter Moore doesn't say much but always makes very salient points
This is better than an episode of 'Game of Thrones' but very similar
Who was it who said that all politics is local!...If this is true then is it any wonder some governments couldn't organise a piss up in a brewery?...And to think that there are many who think that governments around the world are involved in some master plan to control us!!! Government departments don't even talk to each other, never mind different governments!
“The thing is Brian”  “You mean Chairman”  “Get used to Brian,  Brian”
Meanwhile the meeting never came to a conclusion..... and they chat random mlarky until next time.
So he is the appointed chairman and she is "offering her help to organise a meeting". So he's right, she doesn't have authority in the meeting and she shouldn't be trying to take it by force.   On the other hand, maybe more psychologically able people should be elected! The sort of infantile anger coming from them is ridiculous.
Cant wait for the Turf War sequel
Do non-Brits find this as funny as we do?
What a shower of s**t meeting and shows exactly why parish councillors are waste of space jumped up morons.  My 12 year old black and white cat has more intelligence than their combined brainpower
parish paddling pool mud wrestling is the only way forward  we will call it beef meets
Classic YouTube is back babey
“One of the councilors didn’t attend any meeting for the past six months...the fact that there were no meetings held is irrelevant”
It's a meeting about holding a meeting. When do they actually begin to discuss planning and environment?
bollocks
am I missing something🥱
Even football focus is getting in on the act now 😂😂  https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/55958923
Was Jackie Weaver one of the kids in Michael Apted's 7 Up film series?
The chairman of the council is the chairman of the uh...council.
And they say with age come wisdom
Did jackie weaver record it??
How can I apply to be a member of the Handforth Council? This is now on my bucket list...
Have any of these people ever had sex?
These people may have a parliamentary career in future.... They're clearly nuts, devoid of all intelligence and fashion sense... All they need now is an Internet search history that would make Jimmy savile puke and hey presto..! . MP material.
This pandemic is making people more aggressive
god helps us
John Smith is the true politician 🤣
Chairman “I was thrown out of meeting last time”  Chairman “You must know the basic law”  Jackie Weaver “I AM THE LAW”  Aled’s iPad “she has just kicked him out”  Jackie Weaver (aka Britney Spears) “Oops I did it again”
I want to know what the mysterious object at 5:57 is.
0:10 - that sets the tone lol
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM
“Can we be assured that we wont be thrown out of the meeting like we were last time”  This is not her first time🤣☝️
well, I tried to follow it, tried to be fair, and all i can say is it seems #jackieweaverhastheauthority
So this is uk politics summed up in one video
this is the uk!
cant spell CUCK without the UK!
Wittgenstein (Blue Book): "The chairman of the council is the chairman of the council."
Google village of Carpentersville if you like this.
Good lord, these people are horrible. Poor Jackie
I can't stop watching this - all the way from Philadelphia, it is the best!!!
Drunk on power!
They are just starting on her. I don’t blame her kicking him out.
John Smith sounds like Bob Mortimer
Cyn you horrible thing! Look at these half dead corpse giving us health advice 🤣
Please south park, make an episode on this conference call!
Is this a joke
"You have no authority here, Jackie Weaver"  Jackie - "Huge if true"
Wow what a laughing stock 🤣🤣🤣
It's like seeing my 54 year old sister on FB.
also shout out whoever did the closed captioning lol "unintelligible tantrum noises" 😂😂😂
See you all at the next meeting?
"Can we be assured that we won't be thrown out of the meeting like we were last time?" "No."
"IS THIS THING ON?!" I'm an ex-community councillor (long before the days of lockdowns and Zoom) and it's all farcical, cliquey, self-serving nonsense. Arseholes 😂  Edit: bet Jackie's the Secretary. They are _the worst_ 😡
As a planning commissioner in Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA,  I appreciate this video quite a bit for helping me to feel better about our general proceedings.
Carry On Councillor
Parish councils remind me of school councils   Utterly powerless but act as if they have power
And people say “it’s grim up north”  Once they have seen this, they won’t. This is HILARIOUS 😂😂
New drinking game.  Everytime they mention Chairman take a shot.
It’s even better viewing when pissed
The Minutes are now 404.  Does anyone have a mirror?
Coming to Britbox this Spring, a charming and quaint look at small-town governance:   “Handforth Council: Standing Orders” is a lively, almost realistic, story of democracy in action. Episode 1- “Who’s Zooming Who?”  Episode 2- “How Do You Turn This On?”  Episode 3- “Gotta Run, Luv. I’m on a Council Call”
Thought John Smith was Bradley Walsh for a second, laughs like him aswell
How did these people conquer a quarter of the world?
O give me a pity,  I'm on a committee, Which means that from morning to night We attend and amend and contend and defend,  Without a conclusion in sight.  We confer and concur,  we defer and demur, And reiterate all of our thoughts. We revise the agenda with frequent addenda,  And consider a load of reports.  We compose and propose,  we suppose and oppose,  And the points of procedure are fun. But though various notions  are brought up a motions,  There's terribly little gets done.  We resolve and absolve,  but never dissolve, Since it's out of the question for us. What a shattering pity to end our committee, Where else could we make such a fuss!
"Here comes the subpoena!!!" 😂😂😂
"If this goes viral on the internet... it will start a war of words", so wise David Pincome!  Can't wait for episode 2 'the return of the chairman'.  What a cliffhanger til the next meeting.
Whats winnie the pooh doing here
Oh my... I loathe volunteers who try to take control via pride. Stand up and have some balls and excuse her - she is a mere volunteer. Why'd you give her and power?  But OH MY GOSH - if someone is going to try to declare a thing lawful or not - cite the law. And if it is illegal - prosecute. Get educated and organized... oh - BTW, USA Congress and Senate - you should learn better yourselves!
"You have no authority here Jackie Weaver" .....its like a priest exercising a demon 😂😂😂
This is the most english thing I have ever seen
Statecraft within the subcommittee of the steering group is difficult but necessary business
APPALLING BEHAVIOUR
Is this real ???!!!!😂
I reckon Cyn and Alan are exes and Sue and Alan are very much enthralled in a flirtationship, and because of this Cyn is very jealous hence why she keeps shutting down Sue’s reasonable suggestions.
04:04 .. "shes just kicked him out!? ... "IM IN CHARGE!!!".. "read the standing orders! Read them and understand them!!" Lol
This is such an epic shit show!  Hilarious!
This is performance art. I love it. Those people should not waste their valuable time with politics. The world needs them to continue with this awesome sessions of stand up comedy!!!
Thanks for sharing. This is gold!
I just wish they've recorded it in gallery view
It may be no laughing matter, but I had a good laugh.
READ THE STANDING ORDERS
This is how Sex In The City 2 was written
3:26  What's Julie doing...
Bruh our country is fooked.
Friggin hilarious.  Can’t stop laughing.  All the participants trying to behave like VIPs when, in fact, they all behave like children in a playground.  Jackie Weaver is out of order in kicking out the Chairman.  I think she needs to get a proper job, as a nightclub bouncer as she likes chucking people out.  So friggin funny.  The meeting is not about dealing with community affairs it’s all about inflated egos. 😂😂😂👏👏👏😂😂😂
this is the type of video we’ll look back on in five years and laugh
Bunch of loathsome people
WTF and thats why these places struggle with complete idiots like this. What a shambles complete idiots
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM
@snl a war of words 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Armando Iannucci is somewhere seething he didnt come up with this lmao
We love Jackie weaver
Lol this is no.1 on trending 😂
If I may paraphrase Kissinger, "the reason Parish Council politics are so petty is because the states are so low". Except they're not.
No one:  WatchMojo: Top 10 Handforth Parish Council characters
Wtf is this?  Wonder why UK is on their backfoot when they try and hold meetings like it's 1800.
I thought this was fake, because it was so perfectly bad.
YOU’RE MUTED IAN 😂
John Smith is my fav character. When’s the next episode?
The chair:  Jackie Weaver:  YOU ARE THE WEAKEST LINK GOODBYE
"When do we plan to start?"   "Fuck off!"  Oh yeah. This is gonna be good.
3:01 cracks me up for some reason Julie's Ipad
Basically, she is a pushy minute taker who wants to run the meeting, and disregards the person who has been appointed to run the meeting. As the chairman correctly said, she had no authority.
omg this is #1 trending 🗿
We all need to appreciate the man who had the courage to upload this. 👏
I hated that ugly old turtle Weaver since the first moment and wasn't disappointed by my sharp estimation.
I can only imagine this was exactly like sorting out Brexit with the EU lol☺😠🤣
I thought I heard Gollum at 6:00.
why is this #1 Trending
How did David Pincombe know this was going to go viral?
“Alexa, show me Brexit Britain”
Is there an Episode 2?
how british can this get
Hot Fuzz was a documentary.
Jackie Weaver
Many of them aren't fit to be Parish Councillors. They don't have proper knowledge of their own standing orders, probably because most of them can't be bothered to read them.
Yo they are ganging up on a women
14:32 that "uggghh" sound Sue made is what I too make at mere mention of politics
14:31 what is that noise she made 😭
Directed by Amando Iannucci
5:48 Gollum has entered the chat 😂😂😂
"The tranquilizing drug of gradualism." ~ MLK
9:54 JW: "would we be minded to let them back in to the meeting" JS: "I'm afraid I would be loth for that to happen" 😆
Jackie Weaver has no legal right to control the meeting. Who invited her to participate?  She has a flawed knowledge of Local Govt knowledge and should not have been allowed to control it in the way she did,. She epitomizes  why NALC are a self serving bearocracy
I see "Karen's" aren't exclusive to the US.
Handforth Tea ☕️
Jamie Weaver aka Lady Cersei “Off with their Heads!”.
@5:50 I will vote for Vice Councilman Smeagol EVERY.TIME.
bro was sounding like golem 5 mins in
Half these have one foot in the grave no wonder some English law is so backwards these are the Muppets behind the scenes
If he tries to shut down the normal people ONE MORE TIME with rudeness and "....WILL YOU PLEASE...WOMAN..." I’m going to charter a plane to England and START the anger management lessons with him. But, as we can all see...it’s going to be a long, long process. 😂
whos Alan Murdock please  yes please
"One of the counsillors hasn't attended a meeting in six months. The fact that we haven't had a meeting since last March is irrelevant." Bitch what?
Here I was thinking my government was the most dysfunctional, but then came along the English, and suddenly things don't seem so bad here...
This is literally a high school class room and Jackie weaver is the teachers 😂
The best Friday night laugh 😹
If only the (Un)Electoral Commission would hold public meetings. ENGLISH INDEPENDENCE PARTY was unlawfully banned, by refusing to admit statutory Annual Return from EIP Secretary, as they did not recognize them, even though they were on this publicly available register as such ~ They refuse to meet with us, or answer the phone, or explain any concerns in detail.  Merely applying PPERA isn't sufficient for these draconian law-unto-themselves! At the heart of this lies a british-colonial, racist bias against England having its own Independence Referendum. By removing parties from ballot papers, they remove real choice.
Hahahahahahahahahahahhaah salutes from Colombia hahahahahahahahahahahaha those baby boomers LMAO
This is the funniest thing I've seen in a long time. I seriously couldn't stop laughing.  The problem is that the internet and covid is making everyone crazy.  It's especially funny because I find Brits to be the most civilized people in the world.
17:02 "can we make this recording available?" Ooh, I don't know... let's see....
😈
British Comedy Gold!  Like something out of Monty Python lol
It's like waiting for Godot, in hell.
No one likes jackie weaver in this meeting
Mate the thumbnail
This is the best thing to ever happen to the internet 😂😂😂😂
So, erm... did they actually achieve anything that night? 😂😂 Apart from a viral internet sensation of course!
7:11  John: "Thank you Roger yes we will be-"  **Gates of hell open**  - "sorry we will be elaborating on that as well."
People are laughing but if you ask me this bears all the hallmarks of a coup d’etat.  If she can swat aside the best political minds in Handforth and ride roughshod over the democratic process to install her lackeys and lickspittles there what chance has that hapless duffer Boris got?
Amazing, you've managed to show us what all the layers of hell look like in under 20 minutes
Sanditon. Period drama. Handforth. Drama, period.
big up Cynthia, best character arc 😌
‘May i interject?’- what a waste of words.. just interject.
I thought this was a meme😄 initialy
"You have no authority here Jackie Weaver"  Jackie: "So you have chosen death."
6:27 welcome to Handforth, you will never leave
When it cut to John Smith's hair for a split second at 16:33! I died.
I still don’t know what a point of order is
‘When do we plan to start’  ‘Fuck Off’  Cuts with impeccable timing to black screen and ‘Jackie Weaver’   That’s some next level Tarantino shit right there.
Picture this Jackie weaver is caesar and the rest of the council members are the roman Senate
Armando Iannucci must be pushing his fist into his mouth every time he sees this.
So does Jackie Weaver have authority or not?
Beautiful
This made me screech 🤣
It's a shame the minutes have been removed from that website. Did anybody save a copy? Æ
Why did this blow up ?
https://youtu.be/ds9ubRaQcHY  WHAT THE HECK1!!
JOHN SMITH WITH JOKER ENERGY
Sue: *suggests literally anything Cyn: NO no no No NO
Chairman: “The council will decide your fate.” Jackie Weaver: “I *am* the council.”
"Here comes the subpoena" gets my every time
"Can you be respectful to Jackie Weaver please?"  **unexplained manic laughing**
Haha they even realized this could go viral. 😂💀
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo3Z397QPhs
Please can a few more councils share their meetings. lets face it look at the British Cabinet  so what did we expect at the lowest level of government a reflection of the British Cabinet  under Johnson  mmmm  yes
4:18 Aled's iPad: "Read the standing orders. READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!!"  Jackie Weaver?: "Ghasp! Appalling behaviour."  🤣🤣🤣  👏👏👏 good show!
I have no clue what's going on but I love it.
I am from Turkey but I feel like I am watching my older relatives :D I love these people :))))
"My first point is to apologise to Jackie. Welcome to Handforth"  👌
This is the best Monty Python skit i've seen in years....
'youre muted Ian...'
Methinks the boys were enjoying behaving like sexist idiots against a woman
Jackie Weaver, what a little minx!! - "Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on" lmfao
Forget Noah Centenino’s Game Stop movie we need an adaptation of this
https://youtu.be/Lxzjfua9qrw
Is this an out take from The Office ? 🤣😂🤣
5:49  Ancient demon assumes form
What the hell is going on at 12:16 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jackie should be the House of Commons Speaker.  Order!
Jackie Weaver is gangsta !
This needs to be a series. Including a prequel. Why was the Chair kicked out last time? So many questions! Unbelievable video
WHY IS THIS ON TRENDING
WHO IS ALAN MURDOCH OR OTHERWISE KNOWN AS ALANS IPAD
I ship sue and Alan
The sequel will be unbelievable,  How will the rebels formulate their plan to take down jackie weaver? Will cyn become power hungry and cause unrest within the committee? Is sue a double agent? So many questions to be answered
The voice of that self-appointed clerk sounds like he's hanging on to life by the skin of his teeth...so unpleasant in every way
This clip must be sent into outer space in a capsule summarising the great achievements of humanity.
House of Cards season 7: Jackie Weaver sets out on a quest to seek revenge on the people who betrayed her while successfully rising to chair the illustrious Handforth Parish Council.
Is Jackie Weaver the Clerk or not? I’m confused
John i agree the bullying in Cheshire East is out of control
Mr Handforth PC Clerk is a try hard isn’t he
IAN YOUR MUTED
You know its long to be good when the first thing the chairman asks is if he's going to be kicked out 😂😂
Boomer tech
Who recorded this footage originally though? Is boris using webcams to spy?
Mrs Doubtfire is that you?
Thank you Peter
If they ever dramatise this for the BBC, I want Reece Shearsmith playing the guy on the left of Aled's iPad and Bradley Walsh to play John Smith.
Jesus Christ Jackie
I hope Netflix make a series out of this. Absolute comedy gold
READ and understand it
Omg @ 6:04 when he starts laughing had me dead
Silly frustrated old buggers
Morale of the story: don’t try to be something your not! (In this case it’s chairman of the parish council of handforth)
You ever read a comment and think "Damn, I wish I thought of that"? 😂😂😂
A government coup via Zoom
We don't want a turf war breaking out in handforth 🤣🤣🤣 There will be blood shed over pitted olives and capers in the aisles of Waitrose 🤣🤣🤣
This is like what would happen if all the characters from Cluedo were real people and met each other.
It seems that every British Youtube of any standing is watching this video. We are united against Jackie's Tyranny!
Why is this trending ✋🏾😂😂😂
Plot twist: The original chairman is Richard from the undateables !!
This is chaos
You get exactly what you deserve..
It's like watching Clowns performing in a Circus...... THESE are the ACTUAL people YOU trust. Imma Repeat that.. THESE People. YOU put YOUR faith in. To DO the right thing. Can't even act like adults in a video conference... But OFC YOU trust them............
‘We’re trying to have a teams meeting you fool’ 😂😂😂
I bet Jackie Weaver could ban God from a Zoom call meeting.
This could make a brilliant episode of Inside no.9
*Unintelligible screeching* "were trying to have a teams meeting you fool"
Is that Gollum at around 6min???!!!
The only thing I thank covid for. To think this would never of happened otherwise....
Jackie Weaver is better villain than any GOT character.
I’m so confused. Who was in the wrong 😅😂
God, despite all its faults, I can't help but bloody love England ❤
Final proof that technological determinism is true?
Silly bunch of old farts trying to pretend they are important.
Chill your boots
It's rare, but I must say holy fucking shit. We are not in a meeting.
“When do we plan to start”? ..... 5 seconds later “F**k off” 😳😂😂😂  Democracy at its finest...
0:11 0:48 0:52 2:59 3:45 3:58 4:04 4:14 4:20 4:29 5:19 5:43 5:49 5:51 5:57 6:07 6:49 9:42 9:49 10:30 10:49
It's hilarious 😂
Can Malcom Tucker join part 2
I have watched this so many times and laughed so hard each time!
11:23 “Who’s Alan Murdoch” *”Yes please”*
winnie the pooh got a bit aggressive
7:12 Julie is now on the toilet ha!
'Where's the chairman gone? What have you done with the chairman?'  Barry sounded genuinely concerned for his colleague's safety
5:48 Golem that you?
9:40 iconic moment
David Pincombe predicting this may go viral. 👏🏼👏🏼
5:46 *gollum has entered the chat*
OMG! This should be a Quentin Tarantino movie!
No I'm spartacus I mean chairman of the parish council

Death of Stalin 2
“The chairman of the council is the chairman of the council” *- Barry Burkhill 2021*
Looool
Was someone flushing a toilet at 7:12?
Cynthia shutting Sue's olive branch down without remorse was everything. We stan a brutal queen.
I don’t know what is more painful to watch : the meeting itself or the old people attempted to use technology
What NOT to do on Zoom.
Can we acknowledge how that one guy transformed from JFK to It's Always Sunny's Dennis and Golum? He needs to get out of politics and come to Hollywood.
Love to see the minutes
You know when you've been Weaved.
Oh my, oh my. So funny. Was any council business done at this meeting? So funny.
“Sat there like a laughing Hyena” “You may refer to me as Britney Spears”  HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA!!
If anyone ever asks what it is to be British...
No one talking about Sue’s constant attitude throughout? Iconic.
This is a low quality video of the Houses of Parliament
Gogglebox has been dethrowned. Officially.
LMAO this SCREAMS NORTHERN PEAK OF HUMAN COMMUNICATION
Not gonna lie, I think these old men hate having a woman in charge. I'm not into feminist BS just saying what I see.
Did I hear a toilet flush? Oh my days! 🚽😂🤣😂
The sly “f&£k off” at the start sets the standard for the video nicely!
Meryl Streep to win her fourth Academy award for her stirring portrayal of Jackie Weaver in the 2023 film adaption of this masterpiece
Who is Alan please Yes please
need to have a 'Jackie Weaver has authority' t-shirt
People think American politics is exciting, but English parish politics is where it is really at.
Am I the only one thinking that this Jackie Weaver was also being rude by not letting the first man talk? The man who named himself Handforth PC Man was trying to explain his point and I this woman Jackie Weaver was really speaking on top of him, she did not let him talk...
Cynthia is right to shut down everything Sue says because she's just making a constant pointless noise.
I've just spent the last 30 minutes on Zoopla trying to find somewhere, anywhere, in Handforth to move my entire family. This is the greatest thing I've seen. absolutely
Why is this number 1 on trending?? And why is this so hilarious???🤣🤣🤣
"When do we plan to start?"  "Fuck off..." 🤣
Nice Jackie weaver you are good
I feel just like Jackie Weaver When she had to boot that chairman And she couldn't get that meeting to start And neither could that other guy
One flew over the cuckoo's nest gang.😂😂
Are they saying Clerk or Clark?
Seniors Gone Wild Vol. IX
minutes would be a laugh😃😄
#1 on trending in cryinggggg
the 'Dear me' 4:26 by big man David Pincombe is the unsung hero of this video.
This actually isn’t funny. All these clowns are payed by the taxpayer. What an embarrassing group of morons
Dear God, Boomers behaving badly! What a pedantic bunch of w&nkres!
I guarantee they all voted leave, Tory and love Trump.
When’s the next meeting? I’ll bring the popcorn
You should all be ashamed of yourselves. What an absolute waste of public time and money with behaviour that would embarrass a child of primary school age with ADHD. Although hilarious to view, it is simply shocking to witness from democratic representatives. Hang your heads in shame the lot of you
OMG! I almost pissed myself... This is like a mashup of "Yes, Primeminister" and Chimps throwing their own shit at each other, funniest thing for years!!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
8:10 "Did you say it was a badge?" The idea of someone wearing a badge that said 'Handforth PC clerk' would have sounded ridiculous to anyone at the meeting, less so now!
Cassetteboy where you at?
Netflix, please make this into a series
As an American, I thought only we acted like jack assesses at the local level.  Glad to know our cousins also can act like jack assesses too.  Now I don't feel so depressed.
It made me think of The Casual Vacancy by JK Rowling

Sue, you're killing me. Saying you don't know the date cause you can't find you diary when you're sitting in front of a computer
At the end of the day there are surely rules these things are meant to follow. Has anyone figured out who's fundamentally right or wrong?  The whole thing seems ineffectual 😂
No Chairman were hurt in the making of this zoom meeting....
Its hilarious from start to finish for so many reasons!
Julie's I pad
Did anyone else hear ‘eff off’ right at the beginning of the vid? 🤣🤣🤣
Scenes from parish council meetings on “The Vicar of Dibley” may have proceeded almost as haphazardly as this one, but  were vastly more humorous!  Give them a watch on YouTube.
Username: John Smith
Drink every time Jackie Weaver says um
https://youtu.be/fRD_3vJagxk
John's just there for the drama 5:06
3:58
They need to livestream the next one. Donations won't just fix the church roof Jackie can use the extra doe to take a hit out on the chairman.
Gollum makes an appearance at 5:48
This is a Kingsley Amis novel.
You cannot make this s..t up honestly 🙄😒🤭
I like when Gollum turns up just before 6:00
This is the very best thing on the internet right now. thank you
Rumour is that Handforth PC council is still in Jackie Weavers waiting room....its a real knife fight in Handforth
I thought they were toddlers just to find out that they were adults 🤔
Goes to show that these councils and parishes need some fresh blood
You have no authority here Jackie Weaver only the chairman can kick.    Jackie 360 no scoped him.
jumpscare warning at 10:19 for sue
omg These are grown ass adults!  WTF?  This is too much! LOLOLOL
They’re blocked from their own parish website???  I am HOWLINGG
Jackie isnt playing ,step outta line and you are gone.
And you wonder why councils are generally hopeless if this is a example 😂
haha, thought it was just the parish council in my area like this, but I guess they are the same up and down the whole country.  Totally pointless and waste of money in this day and age. But at least it gives nosey busy bodies something to do when they aren't curtain twitching.
Millions of people have now entertained themselves with those dulcet tones. Fantastic.
Handbags at dawn.
Is that Smegel at 5:50?
It's like a Vicar Of Dibely reboot in the dystopian future of Hanforth, Cheshire East.
The biggest drama is when it's revealed the chairman has appointed himself clerk
Jackie weaver > Carole baskin Original chair man > Ned stark
5:39 to 6:03 One of the most freaky/ scary moments in this cult produced video.  Come on Louis Theroux, I know you've already made calls....
Not only Is this incredibly funny , All there names are  absolutely fantastic ! Everything about this fabulously British footage is remarkable!
Count me on #TeamChairman — without the law, HPC, all is darkness! #JackieWeaverHasNoAuthorityHere #BritishCaroleBaskin #Hanarchy
Can someone please explain what’s happening
"You have no authority here Jakie weaver"  *reveals white robe and staff*
Howling. Love from the Netherlands.
Bruh Why is this number 1 trending, great job YouTube
Brilliant!!!
I feel like someone needs to dub the game of thrones credits at the start. You have no authority here Jackie Weaver no authority at all! Jackie weaver then blocks him with glee. 'Tell the Handforth PC clerk. I want him to know it was me.'
Waiting for house prices to drop drastically in Hanforth
"Dear me!" And that was all David wrote.
Royston vasey looks more appealing than this place 😂
it's the 'laughing hyena' for me
John smiths laugh at 5:09 he’s just pleased to be invited
I'm in charge, right ......
Warped Chairman, Jackie Weaver looms...
If someone photoshopped these guy's faces onto the four lads meme I'm not sure the internet could advance any further
These tiny people with their tiny minds deluded they are more important than they actually are. Stupid little inadequate unimportant little men.
Gollum made a nice appearance there...🤣🤣🤣
What a very unprofessional and embarrassing meeting. What was achieved? Taking phone calls, toilet flushing, talking over each other, no respect. It's about time this sort of meeting and behaviour is stopped.
So was this the season finale or do we have further episodes to look forward to? and here I thought The Expanse season 5 was good...
‘Please can Alan Murdoch be brought back into the meeting’ 😭
David is such a visionary
I can see the film now! The name’s Weaver. Jackie Weaver...
https://youtube.com/channel/UCXTQV2gDN2qWcjaXMa0OOPw
This is what's wrong with protestantism.
JOHN: 'We don't want a turf war breaking out'
I can imagine a sequel of the Hot Fuzz being based in Handforth.
The comments on here are a goldmine.
The old grumpy rude obnoxious chairman and the gobby little vice chairman squirt were a total disgrace. Two jumped up no marks who behave like skidmarks and were OWNED by Jackie Weaver ROFLAMO take that prats!!!!!!!!!! If either of them have grown a pair the only thing they can now do besides holding their heads in utter shame should be to resign ASAP! These two idiots are the LAUGHING STOCK of the WORLD and rightly so ROFLMAO!
Jackie Weaver for PM
Thought John Smith was Bradley Walsh for a sec
I bet John Smith has a life size cut out of John Craven in his house. Along with John Craven.
Only 1.9 million views then
jackie really said “noo NOO I AM THE COUNCIL”
Frickin women.
05:49 GOLEM!
There are more people on this flipping committee than actually LIVE in Handforth!
Is this a new language we don’t know about
'Where have you gone, Jackie Weaver? Our nation turns its lonely eyes to you Weave, weave, weave...'
KARE
This is the beat love it im in ttears
"The chairman of the council....is the....a......chairman of the council"
Funnier than series one but where are David Tennant and Michael Sheen?
Who said "fuc* of*" at the beginning?
These people will end up trying to rearrange the deckchairs on the titanic.
Ive never seen the chairman get kicked out of the meeting.. omg Jackie is unbareable
British politics at its finest
The meeting is at 7pm....but starts around 9
Thumbnail coming straight outta 2008
I'm so addicted to whatever's going on between Alan and Sue... from her passionate "He's a member of the public!" to the interjection of "YES THAT'S HIM" for Alan's iPad as soon as it was announced... to "You're always disruptive" "just by looking at you", to the way he seems to turn her into a giggly schoolgirl... star crossed lovers if I ever saw them :')
Alan is such a flirt 11:57  'just by looking at you'
I want to hear Peter play guitar.
What in the middle class caucasity is this 😂😂 Lockdown was all worth it.
I love how this is number 1 trending UK. What a meeting!
Has this video started the turf war ?
16:12 ha ha
Netflix have just bought the rights. Britney Spears is odds on favourite to play Jackie. And if you think they are roudy in a  Zoom meeting wait until they can actually meet in 2022.
has to get the oscar for zoom calls during lockdown
When is the movie out? 🤣
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM
Number 1 trending lets gooooo
This is what happens when you have too much time on your hands! Life’s too short
So disrespectful, we put Oblivion music in the background... So funny!  This is what you get when you lock people and after a year you give them a chance to talk ...hahaha! What an awful example for younger generations ...haha? Meme material though.
17:15 "if you want to listen to my dulcet tones" The rest of the world: "don't worry we're listening".
Love Ian swooping in at 8:02 with the receipts, and very pleased with himself for it.  Give 'em hell Ian!
The steering group sanctioned by the sub committee will have no authority without the approval of the council clerk via his secretary, once overruled by the chairman who lacks the authority subject to the approval of the sub group appointed by a point of order.
It’s like giving a bunch of baboons an I pad each and watching them wipe their Ass with them . Bunch of fools.
Your muted Ian
Shall we set up a subcommittee for The steering committee ... one person yes, next person yes, next ...no way....
Your subtitles are are wrong, think you need a Manc to do them for you haha
This has become so big it’s time someone fixed the appalling subtitles.
As a man in who lives in handforth, this is everyday here
shout out to my man John Smith taking the piss out of all these melts the entire time
Holy moley its gollum at 5:55 LMAO
Why all public servants are old farts?
We don't want a TERF war breaking out! Pmsl
I TAKE CHARGE
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM
Get you someone who laughs at your jokes like Sue
This was much more fun when the Chairman was in the room. Jackie Weaver really took the fun out...
Councillor Cartman, you’re on mute.
5:50 has a Gremlin taken over the chat at this point?
Who is alan Murdock ? Alan’s ipad
This is the epitome of English dealings.  Entangled in formalities and egos. Bumbling contrarians
Julie’s I pad
Can’t wait for the prequel as we discover why they were thrown out of the first meeting.
This is British politics at its best .
This is the most boomer comment section I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂
I bet John smith is in all of the ladies DMs INCLUDING Jackie Weaver
14:00 'Ashley.... ooh I've said his name now' best british indiscretion since Mannering's 'don't tell em your name Pike!'
Jackie weaver is an ICON
READ THE STANDING ORDERS. READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM🤬🤬🤬🤬
"could I ask you to be respectful to Jackie" "AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
Omg this is amazing
What the middle class does when they're not voting for Brexit.
Going through over 6k comments to try and work out whether Jim Davidson or Peter Kay will use this and have left their OWN comments. 🤣 Whos going to play Jackie Weaver?
What. a joke this lot are.
Those people put Handforth on the map today 😂
9 minutes in and talking absolute shite haha
yiddad2015 subscribe
This is my favorite Monty Python sketch.
Love how everyone hanged up on them after they'd left 😂
Jackie weaver uses “kick from meeting”  It’s super effective.
The Vicar of Dibley meets The Thick of It
"READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!!!"
Feel like Jackie Weaver disrupted their old boys club and they couldn't handle it 😂 she wasn't taking their shit
The council will decide your fate
how did we go from conquering half the world to not even having a proper zoom call.
Joe Orton wrote this 53 years after he died
John Smith's a snake!! 🐍
Thank heavens for John Smith making sure this recording would be available. Where can I watch the meeting from the second Tuesday in January?
These fools think they’re debating in the House of Lords. They’re just Micky Mouse Councillors....
The Queen's Gambit personified
This is why the 27 countries of the European Union cheered when the UK left. The biggest bunch of whining wankers in the world.
John Smith unmuting himself for the sole purpose of laughing at Jackie Weaver 🤣🤣🤣
I've never seen a group of more petty people. I would fit right in and I could learn a thing or two from these weisenheimers.
I don't know the ins & outs of the procedure but Jackie Weaver would not be on my christmas list
What you talking about you don't know what you're talking about   Next sentence   The chairman of the Council...is the chairman of the Council
The real hero here is Barry, facing away from the camera whilst shit hits the fan
Ego’s - that’s all it is!! That’s all it ever is 🙄
what even is a parish council
Thank goodness these dinosaurs are nearly extinct.
Actually devastated the vice chairman left...
JACKIE WEAVER
Not quite The Vicar Of Dibley is it?
Welcome to Little Britain.
"When do we start"  "... faaack off."
I nearly lost my shit when Sue proposed a subcomitee within the steering group of the taskforce for the environments and planning directive.
The chairman of the council..is the chairman of the..........Council
This is chaotic
Ok, this is extraordinary. Wow. Special thanks to Steven Morgan for putting this on the internet
Brexit Britain at its finest 🤣
This is still more organised than Brexit
Lol Jackie Weaver is clueless 😁😁😁
Who is this women at 3:35 under rated
'Fuck off'. incredible
A reminder that the general public would make for awful politicians too 😂
Power tripping old boys who have anger management issues if challenged.
This is typical of people in general, face to face they are civilised, mindful and watch what they say. Over the internet people are often rude and thoughtless.
Julie’s I Pad is a mood
08:00 ever tried to improve your home and someone complains to the council. this is the smarmy pri4ck
I love when everyone is deciding their favourite character and right at the end some Abed like 4th wall break geezer called David Pincombe comes out of nowhere and steals the show
I wonder if its like this at cabinet meetings
Needed this so much! A perfect combination of whispered swearing, in opportune phone call, guy facing the wrong way, angry exchanges, petty rivalries and camaraderie. I laughed until I cried. I have no idea what the meeting was about but it is, without doubt, the most entertaining zoom meeting I’ve ever seen. Go HPC!!!
Ian: “Severe lag on the system.”
"The chairman of the Council is .. the chairman of the Council" - Barry Burkhill. Never change bazza, never change.
3:55 😂😂
Who keeps gasping dramatically in the background whilst shit's kicked right off 😂
Heard this on radio today, come here and is trending no.1, absolute madness
I am now writing a play based on this meeting. This is the greatest piece of modern comedy.
Damn there's so much bureaucracy going on in this thing haha. No wonder the planet is on its arse when people like this are in charge
Hot fuzz Kafkaesque prequel ass video
Dude... these men are absolute children. I just watched a man in his 80s point and laugh at someone. Really?
Do you suppose they think themselves above youths hanging about the parish bus stops? because this really just shows how very incredibly dysfunctional older adults can be.
"... go viral...." he said! 🤣
Old people. 🙄
"JUST THANK GOD IT'S A ZOOM MEETING! "  how true!
This is probably like a government COBRA / SAGE meeting, this is why Britain is such a mess, people like this have decided kids can't go to school and hairdressers and barbers have had to close, our lives are in these sort of petty people's hands!
If someone could over dub this with Jamaican  road man or Irish traveller call out clips I could die happy
I think john and jackie are secretly beatin
I can’t stop laughing and I’m only 2 minutes in. Is this a government intervention to distract us all from reality? *lol*
I really want to read the strongly worded email
THERE'S A PREQUEL!!! Thank you. I needed this.
Boomers aren't human
5:19 best part
British adaptation of Boys N Da Hood.   Warning - Strong Language
5:57 Smegal has entered the meeting...
Some classic baby boomer behaviour all round 😂
I love how the councillors refer to Alan and Peter as just “members of the public” as if they hold some power bestowed upon them by God that makes them far superior haha
Is there anything less efficient in this world than a parish council?
This episode of "The Vicar of Dibley" was directed by Quentin Tarantino
Julie’s I Pad
i'm so confused, whos the bad guy here
This feels like I'm watching a netflix experimental comedy. Where's the curb your enthusiasm music.
This is so stupid. What on earth are they for? It's like a nightmare.
This is funny but quite serious. These fucking boomers are everything that's wrong with this country.
I can’t get enough of that scandalised gasp after Brewerton shouts “READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM”
"I think if this goes viral on the internet..."
18 mins long and not a single useful thing was said. Amazing.
We need Netflix adaptation of this political drama
It’s the “Guess Who’s Chairman Now?” game.
Ok, ok. I give up. I still consider myself a film buff, but one cannot know everything. So who is it? Kubrick? Tarkovsky? Kim ki-duk? Fellini? Hmm, it’s quite surreal... Buñuel? Come on, somebody please tell me who the director of this absolutely brilliant, masterpiece of film-making is!
No wonder nothing ever gets done!  Not as funny as the Goons spoof council meeting.
The way they're laughing at Jackie weaver😂😂
Probably the funniest meeting I've ever seen
I really wished they had let the chairman back in 😂
Why did they have to drag Britney into this? #freebritney
What a horrid man Aled is
"We can't get on the Handforth Parish Council website - we're blocked." So a committee of the Handforth Parish Council has been blocked by their own parish council. 'Wonder why? Do these physically mature individuals have no sense of responsibility at all? 'Still, it's entertainment for the rest of us!
If you're only going to watch a couple minutes of this, start at 3:57 and watch through 6:09
Councillor Burkill = Brian Potter
Jackie Weaver staged a coup!
Why does this feel like a YTP video
This is brilliant 😂
Sue is underrated
Defining phrase of our time “ please mute your microphone “
They're fortunate anyone volunteers to be Clerk - in most committee meetings this is a 'short-straw' role.
Severe lag on the system..
Is this a lost episode of The Vicar of Dibley?
hey this was on my birthday :)
😂😂😂
There needs to be a Steven Spielberg film based on this , a documentary series, a Q&A show and merchandise
Welcome to Handforth
Just so everyone is Clear: The clerk is employed by the council, under section 112 (1) of the Local Government Act 1972, to provide administrative support for the council's activities. Any other staff, although employed by the council, answer to the clerk who is their manager and is responsible for their performance.'Proper officer' is a title used in statute. It refers to the appropriate officer for the relevant function. In town and parish councils, the proper officer is normally the clerk. In financial matters, the proper officer is known as the Responsible Financial Officer.
What is being said at 0:11. I know what I think I heard, but am I alone!  Also when are they releasing the prequels? I want to see why the Handforth PC clerk was the thrown out previously. There’s much more to this than meets the eye,
Most people are thick as fuck
This just goes to show, synonymous with most other councils up and down the land, that we are governed by a load of morons who are so out of touch with the real world. A total bunch of w**k**s.
Pc cleck sounds like a monty python character 😅😅
Bloody Clarks of Handforth!.....
Underrated part; John smith feeling the need to clarify that the bullying is not merely endemic to Chershire East, no, it has reached the ENVIRONS also...
Jackie is a twit I'm glad someone told her 🤣🤣
Now it's time to reenact the whole thing with Helen Mirren, Ian McKellen, Colin Firth, Tilda Swinton, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes... it will win 5 BAFTAs
I dunno about you but I sense a bit of sexual tension between Sue and ‘Alan’s iPad’
What on earth is happening at 05:48 ?
"I'm taking over as clerk of the Parish County."  Beware, a coup d'etat!   "We put the disruptive members in the waiting room." 😂😂😂 HILARIOUS!
No. No, just no. The usage of the word “technology” is inappropriate. It is an insult to the word itself!
Who let the senile residents of Handforth Old People's Home escape?
Pure Christopher Guest
Clark?
Julie's ipad knew she was onto something special
“Jackie Weaver. I’m arresting you on suspicion of unlawfully acting as the proper officer whilst kindly volunteering as the Clerk for this meeting...  You have the right to remain silent. Anything you do say will be recorded and shared on the internet”
A TURF WAR BREAKING OUT omfg
I would PAY to watch their next meeting !! 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Loving the cameo appearance via "Julie's I pad" at 3:07
They are all unprofessional and clearly this is mean girls versus the other mean girls.
Why’s no one talking about dan pincombe only saying “Do me” and that’s it
When's the next episode?
The questions we should ask in  2021 : who is Alan Murdoch and did Julie’s iPad ever call back.
The first time I’ve regretted moving out of handforth
This is how I imagine the old soviet bureau meetings were
Abandon hope all ye who enter here 😳
Blocked from their own website 😂 I’m deceased
THE TURF WAR IS ON!!! I SEE JACKIE TRYING A  HOSTILE TAKEOVER
Roger dramatically turning his chair in the first few seconds
The huff from Julie's ipad following her phone call is a very underrated moment.
Little Britain “LIVE”
I was like did he say F*** OFF Comments section....YES I'm 5 minutes in and this is beautiful 😂😂😂
Jackie be like 'I am the senate!'
Team passive aggressive Vs team aggressive

can anyone explain wtf is this? I dont get it
Wtf is happening 😂😂😂
Gollum is apparently attending off-screen at 5:49
Come, friendly bombs, and fall on Handforth The home of every dreary jobsworth. The cabbages are coming now; The earth exhales.
Can anyone help me find the prequel to this - the previous meeting that Tolvey got kicked off, and references at the start?
Bradley hall?
Batley Townswomen's Guild Presents the Battle of Pearl Harbor
GG Jackie Weaver ... We need regular streams of this parish meeting.
Anyways when's the next episode out
5:46 - 6:00 Gollum and Smeagol have join the call.
Is this Canon?
Cyn is such a negative nelly. Hope they write her out in the next episode
5:49 Im so serious, I cant get past this part without crying. I love British Parks and Rec.
So many unanswered questions.... Why did the chairman claim he was the clerk of Handforth Parish Council on his Zoom ID? Why does Peter Moore hate the chairman so much? Did Jackie Weaver ever read and understand the Standing Orders? Did Julie ever return that call? Does Aled Brewerton know his iPad is being used for such purposes? Did a copy of this video get sent to the monitoring office?   I leave this video with more questions than answers.....
What if Jackie Weaver was the banker from Deal or No Deal?
At 5:50 Gollum joins the chat you can’t see him but you can hear him
This is the perfect 3 am material!
Has that Hot Fuzz village vibes written all over it ... ooo Jackie there’s been a muuuurder
im so confused     how is this no1 trending. I-
This is like the Parish Council in Hot Fuzz, they are straight up murdering the disruptive members of the public.
Why does he sound like Gollem at 5:49?
Who would want to live here?
#teamJackieWeaver
"Can we make the recording of this meeting available?"  Jackie Weaver's famous last words: "I don't see why not?"
I'm confused what dimension am I in
9:20  Jackie "ummmm" weaver
Cantankerous old idiots. Perfect job for the types of people they are. Argumentative!
HILARIOUS 🤣
Comedy gold. Did the vice chair just turn up with his dad? WHO IS ALAN MURDOCH?? The sound of the toilet flushing was pure poetry. Am assuming Jackie will now be running the subcommittee of the steering group.
I watched this several times and still couldn’t spot Piers Morgan?
Oh, baby, baby, I shouldn't have muted you But I must confess, I still believe  I have authority over you, when you lose your mind Oh baby, baby I shouldn't have muted you
"Bare with me a second" followed up by a close up of his tiddy. Iconic
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE...GANDALF STORM CROW
I dont see why this is trending the way it is.🥱
Chairman: They haven’t the guts, the great supine protoplasmic invertebrate jellies!   Jackie Weaver: He has been kicked from the meeting
The chairman of the council is the chairman...  of the council!!
Merch opportunity, they should make badges saying "I am the clerk of the parish council"
Such a small part in the whole charade but Peter Moore is my favourite character. He's so angry, he's absolutely seething. I hope he gets a bigger part in the sequels
T-shirt incoming  YOU HAHE NO AUTHORITY HERE JACKIE WEAVER
How illegal can booting someone out of a zoom meeting be?! I’m dying over here 😭😭😂
not to be dramatic but i would die for jackie
The under the breath "fuck off" was obviously the persons reaction to seeing the chairman has anointed himself the Clerk.
Imagine living next to him... could never be me....
I love this so much omg. Adorable so so so adorabless
“Clerk of Carish Pouncil”
So funny. Love Jackie Weaver
What the hell is Golum doing at a parish council meeting 😂 5:46
Funny I watch this and I think it’s Jackie that is seriously mis-using her power. But watch all the Woke crawlers because she is female.
3:46 The greatest anime betrayal.
*WILL YOU STOP TALKING!!!*
Fact: this is so awesome because with their names appearing every time is like an endless credit role of awesome moments/introductions
I can see a Hollywood blockbuster in the making here! I vote Britney  Spears to play the role of Jackie Weaver &  Tommy Lee Jones to play the  ex-communicated Chairman!!🤣🤣🤣🤣😁😅😅
When's the next episode of this out?
Having worked for some not for external profit organisations in my career - can certainly relate to this type of meeting - power mad some people - very vindictive
hahaha was Little Britain modelled on this lot????
Here before 2 mil
it's marvellous!
Oh god this was hillarious. Really cheered me up.
I hope future releases won't be marred by them being too serious now that people are watching - this gives Channel 4's Gogglebox a run for their money.
In a world of chaos we need a John Smith
The (dramatic exit) at 6:03 is award-worthy  Seriously the captioning is gold
When is the next meeting??? can we all join in???? hahahahahaha
Bercow would have sorted this shambles out.Orrrrddeerrrrrrrr.
Cyn for PM. The woman will not stand for any disruption or laughing like a hyena in any way. Quite right.
Stop doing meetings wrong!
Augh I love my country 😂😂🇬🇧😍🥰
Can someone please explain why she says call me Britney spears?! 😂😂😂
Projection and counter transference...
Such lovely comments.  I hope this goes viral in China.
Glorious 😄
Jackie Weaver: “I AM THE LAW” (Dredd voice)
Is this the world's end council?   Seems about as funny.    Lol
These people are idiots across the board
"Who is Alan Murdoch?" "Yes please" is underrated
Guess whose coming back in a new series... "In the thick of handforth"
Drinking game every time they say Chairman
5:48 Gollum decided to join!
Can we have the prequal 😂
This is the greatest and most pompous nonsense i've seen in my life!  ROFL!
Did someone flush the bog at 7:12? 😂
So this is why shit can't get done. Is this how all council meetings are run? On another note, the men at the beginning of this are disgusting! Is this how they normally react to a woman in charge? They need be booted out!
#1 trending HAHAHAHA
I'm Helens I-pad..can you authorise me please ?
"Welcome to Handforth" 😂🤣😂
He is not the Clark of the Parish Council. He is a very naughty boy!
Beadley hole sent me
I need to see the prequel!
This is the country I live in
Technology and humans in perfect harmony 🙈
I’m the clerk of Handforth Parish Council! No I’m the clerk of Handforth Parish Council. No I’m the clerk of Handforth Parish Council....no you’re not ! I’m the clerk of Handforth Parish Council. No no I’m the clerk of Handforth Parish Council no shut the **** up
"you don't know what you are talking about.. chairman of the council.. is the chairman of the.. um... council".. LOL!!!!
Please can someone do a dub mix of this.
Jackie Weaver is a disgrace. Power to the Vice-Chair!
This was disgraceful! This was clearly a case of men not liking a woman being in charge. They were so rude and very fickle and a stickler for protocol even though the meeting was on zoom. They assumed they knew best. She handled it well.
5:45 Barry. No, Barry, is gone *demonic noises*
😂😂 I love How they say her full name like she is in a witch trial *"Jackie Weaver the committee hath found thee to be a witch and you are sentenced to the ducking pond and may God have mercy on your soul!!"*
I know they’re a bunch of OAP’a who are probably over entitled and pompous but God I would love to be part of their meetings when they meet in person
Now all we need is Piers Morgan .
I hope the voters in Handforth remember this, when the elections for the parish council take place! What a ridiculous way to have your community put on the map!
Game of Thrones : Handforth
I'm so thankful these world class politicians are guiding us through this epidemic.
And I thought things were effed up in the USA. I’m somehow comforted by this insanity.
Comedy gold from Boomers inc. Bless the lot of 'em!
Handforth PC Clerk Handforth Parish Council. Will decide your fate Jackie Weaver: I *am* Handforth Parish Council!!
Julies I pad really was like 👁👄👁. Obsessed with this not getting involved attitude.
What’s up with Aled’s iPad?!
What's that guy wearing on his head at about 3:12 in?
Jackie Weaver is a cross between Dirty Harry and The Terminator. Bravo and beautiful. No messing. Silly little sad sexiest jumped up old men on power trips giving parrish councillors a terrible name.
What's with gollum noise at 5.50 😂😂
You don't get this crap in China.
One question why is this first on trending
Is this village, solely inhabited by Karen's and Kevin's?   Secondly I love the shocked gasp when that pompous ass screams "READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM" Literally dying 4:23
The anger in Peter Moore's face when he says "quite rightly" is something else!
This is fabulous!! Bossy brit OAP takes over with no authority
Chair: you shall not pass!  Jackie: we'll see
5:48 - is that the demon from the Exorcist talking?
If they used a Gallery view it might be easier (and more fun for us)
3 cheers for Peter Moore. How petty is 'the chairman' with his filthy manners. The appalling 'vice chairman' with his vile, misogyny laden ranting. I wouldn't want either of them to 'chair' my garden being mown let alone my community decided upon. Despicable behaviour in this climate.
There are a lot of smug keyboard warriors here who wouldnt be caught dead involved in a council. Lets all be smug and waste our time on youtube comments  instead... actual results are not just hard to comeby but practically impossible.  I just have a softspot for people who get involved in the shitshow that local councils often are. Becuase they are opting in.
Jackie weaver and John Smith must be brother and sister on top of being husband and wife.
Lots of ‘computer says no’ moments in this movie!  Love it! :)
Omg these comments! 🤣🤣
Jackie rules with an iron fist!
Please please ... can the Creature Comforts folk animate this in claymation. That would make our year.
Absolutely brilliant
Can we please have Handforth Council meetings live televised like parliament ?
This is going to turn into a west end smash hit like Hamilton... i guarantee it...
old people are fuckin wild lmao
What a bunch of self-important wind bags. You’re all so out of touch. It’s appalling that any of you have been put in a position of faux-power within the council. It’s no wonder you don’t get anything done if your meetings are conducted in that way. You should all resign and be ashamed.
Cyn says NO
This is like a parody episode of a council meeting - absolutely hilarious. Loved every minute, and Sue? You're a sweetheart.
Woman with no authority decides she is the arbiter of who may attend & what may be said, although she is only a clerk.  I'd call it shocking, but women failing to listen is hardly news.  Be respectful to Jackie Weaver, who is behaving like an absolute tosspot?  Not likely.
"One of the councillors did not attend a meeting for six months... the fact that there were no meetings held, is irrelevant" 13:31
Im *crying* with laughter. Its been such a long time since that happened last - bless you, Handforth Parish Committee.   Why does Jackie get full named so often? Is this some kind of Colin Robinson diss?
Anyone else need subtitles? What are they talking about?? 😆
5:20 - 6:10 just feels like I've stumbled onto a LOTR shitpost - not helped by the Gollum cameo
I think I know what I'll play for our next board meeting.
MISSUS WEAVAH! MISSUS WEAVAH READ THE RULES! READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND!
That old man is basically an old man who is just a old man
Vintage stuff.
Best claim is the it appears the Chairman is trying to claim that she was only there as a member of the Public so he is saying that the Council he runs conducts it's affairs in Chatrooms they have no control over and entrust it to random members of the public to set them up?  That's pretty wild and a damning condemnation of the man if his claim is true he needs to stand down right now, not just as Chair from public office as he has utterly failed.  So I am assuming it is therefore a lie and he needs to stand down for lying and abusing his authority and for the attempted bullying we saw take place.
Gasp at 4:25 😱
When Game of Thrones meets Golden Girls
wtf have i just watched no wonder nothing ever gets done they just all talk shite lmfao
I love how everyone is bashing Jackie the whole time for just being a complete goon, lmao
What actual business have they got through here?? Incredible waste of time. It's a meeting about a meeting about a point of order about a meeting.
Jackie Weaver has now been added to my list of Heroes To Look Up To.
anyone else live in Handforth? 🤩
"We don't want a turf war breaking out"  I want to see the vote on wool-ball drive-bys and pamphlet assaults.
John Smith is a pitiful excuse for a man.
It's why the country is fucked. My dealings over the years with parish councillors has shown me that they are self centered mainly elderly, and corrupt on a small scale. The last one is a parish councillor, who wants the stretch county drainage team to sort her water coming off her property, over that of people's homes being flooded.
surely this is staged
“Would it be, um, acceptable to send a message to them to say if they are prepared to come back and, um, behave in the proper manner, then we would happily have them back in the meeting?”  “No.”
"The chairman of the council is the chairman of the .... council". Well, not wrong
Honestly one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life. The level of pettiness and insistence on pointless beurocracy is so British. Love it.
6 mins in *grabs vodka* this is the best meeting on the internet ever. 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆 Netflix do your thing 👏👏👏
Why is Smeigel talking at 5:57?
I was surprised Eric Potts is on the council board?
Will there be a second season?
5:45 he turns into golum on speed...
Peter's guitar game is strong.
Peter Moore’s short “quite rightly” cameo always makes me die
If I've said it once, I've said it a hundred times: The bullying in Cheshire East and environs is off the charts.
They are in the waiting room - like children on the naughty step 😂
Village politics are hilarious 😂
05:48 Parish Councillors sing Death Metal
For those on this call absolutely fuming, at least they got brexit through. It's so gammon it hurts.
What's the latest on the turf war? 😬
the chairman has the best eyebrows i've ever seen
Me the entire time watching this: 5:05
A total embarrassment. Elected members behaving appallingly. The analogy of don’t know ‘arse from elbow’ springs to mind. This is not a good advert for young people with an interest in politics. There is no respect for each other or different perspectives, and the swearing is wholly unprofessional and offensive. Each person is trying to get one up on the next and it becomes uncomfortable, cringeworthy and then laughable. They should be put before overview and scrutiny for the conduct and behaviour. I would have no confidence in those elected members or Parish Council as a member of that community. Ghastly politics - teenagers could do better and would be more respectful.
Great video but I think that the chemistry between Alan’s IPad and Sue is very forced by the writer
5:49 where did golem come from
I was a member of the management committee of a large community center for years.. Part of the reason for staying for so long was sitting back and watching this kind of event play out.. Flashbacks. Love it.
Gan on, Jackie lass, tak ne shite
Who tf is Jackie weaver
"I'm going to subpoena everybody". Ooo-er!
Absolutely appalling behaviour from all of them! I'd sack the lot of them!
It’s like the table read for an Avenger’s movie.
Was that a toilet flushing at 7:11 ?
"YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE JACKIE WEAVER"
Bless him 🥺
No need for excercise, if i watch this everyday ill have a six pack in no time, goodness thats funny thankyou parish council for bringing so much joy
In the UK this is a Parish Council.   In the USA, this is the National Government.
Can't wait for the film adaptation
Why are they all so old?
Lmao Netflix could never. Quality entertainment. Supreme tea.
This bloke calling himself PC Clerk needs to find a good dentist pronto! Half his gnashers are gone!
So what was the point of the meeting, other than to bicker & shout. Because I heard nothing discussed other than who had what authority or not & whether to allow folks back into the ongoing fiasco. The only thing agreed upon was something to do with a tuesday in January & then it finnished. Did they sort it out or was it just a comedy of errors.
Growing up in Britain I have always had this nagging feeling it's a very very silly country....
Did literally anything get accomplished in this meeting?
I still can't understand what's going on. Who is the chairman? Lol can't wait for part two. The Turf War.
Somebody has to remix this to slim shady.  'Would the real chairman please stand up'
It’s like a sketch written by Ricky gervais 😂
Thank god I live in Wales
Next step for this lot is the House of Commons...did our Cabinet do their work experience  at this council?
This is absolutely amazing. I found it hilarious but with a serious undercurrent of misogyny. The implication is Jackie Weaver has no penis and therefore no authority.
11 seconds in “F**k off” had me in stitches. You know it’s about to kick off.
Game of Thrones season 8 rewrite looking good
The Gollum part thoughhhh 😂😂😂😂  We're trying to have a teams meeting you fool
4:18 We are blessed.
This is brilliant!
Was that Gollum at 5:47 demanding the ring from Frodo?
This is a Harold Pinter type drama
Aled's iPad, are you Paddy McGuiness?
Poor Jackie Weaver
Bradley Hall
Julie's I pad
Fascinating
And to think the people that pay tax in Handforth fund this shit.
I’m six minutes in and aled is my favourite character so far
This is the type of thing we like to see on the trending page
If you could study “parish council meetings” as a subject, this would be an exam question.
Every time someone moans about “kids these days” they should be shown this.
Who's your favourite character?
This has made my day. Lol. The best parts are:  the f**k off at the start. How they all just let Julie answer her phone The gasps at peoples behaviour John Smith just laughing at people Gollum making a rare appearance after the fall in to mount doon.   Haha, this has just fantastic. Can we all attend as members of the public?
My god this is just comedy gold 🤣
I really want a law professional to tell me council parish law after this
Proof adults can and do behave like children in front of a supply teacher. For the same reasons. 😄. An interesting example of primate behaviour.
American here - Looks a lot like the US Congress but with accents.
I saw this at 10,000 view and I came back at a million because it is so good. Chaos! Looooool
Funnnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
David pincombe coming through with the foresight.
John Smith is my spirit animal
13:30 'one of the councillors from the west ward did not attend a meeting for 6 months...the fact that there were no meetings held is irrelevant'  John Smith that logic is as original as your name 😂😂😂. He reminds me of Frank Pickle.
This is the best
I'm blown away by this series. The amount of lore here is incredible, the character arcs were shocking and although we had two canon deaths, this series was amazing
david saw it coming
It's like witnessing a dementia ward after all the patients are woken up in the at 3am.
Nobody: The demon resisting exorcism from the body of an 8 year old girl in the background: 5:48
Hahaha 😂
Old foggies
How did these people conquer the world? I can't imagine them getting anything done at all.
They know how to run a meeting, you've got to 'Hand' it to them 😂😂😂
Why is nobody talking about Peter’s hand being up the whole time he spoke 😂😂😂😂
Netflix: "We're working on a brand new series, coming soon"
5:49 what on earth was that 💀😭
Aled is impressive. He managed to do an impression of both Gollum *and* Smeagol (in their duality) in the space of a few seconds, just like Andy Serkis.
“Serve lag on the system”
Well that’s 18 minutes I won’t get back
Jackie Weaver clearly doesn't have a clue
"Move over Ronny Pickering, I'm Jackie Weaver!"
Please can we see the video of the chairman being slung out of the first meeting? It's like watching a sequel without having seen the first film!
This is the most English argument I've ever seen 😂 oh I love my country! 😂😂😂😅
David Pincombe is a man of culture! He knew this would go viral
Someone needs to add Oblivion music to this
god this gives the same vibe as a parks and rec town meeting and i'm honestly in love.
Jackie weavers a snake 🐍
I can't stop watching Smeagol on Aled's iPad.
Or Charlie Brooker, Jacques Perreti, Stewart Lee....?
Aled Brewerton - "Here come the subpoenas!" 😂
from what I have read: the clerk and the proper officer can be the same person, so the chairman (prior to be ing ejected) seems to not know the law himself. Or have I missed something? perhaps this can be covered in series 2!
The Dibley Parish council were more productive than this lot 😂
"READTHEMANDUNDERSTANDTHEM" said Moses unto his people
Let the war of words commence
Politicians unmuted 😂
When Jackie Weaver's name appears at the start it really looks like the opening credits to the best film ever made.
Voted Sue as Best Girl on Crunchyroll
Literally can’t wait for the next episode 👌🏽
Jackie's eyebrows are iconic
It's just a boys club. Disgusting behaviour.
Did anyone cole from the spiffing brit?
Hahahahaha not laughed so much in a while.  Classic comedy
Can we make this recording available? To 1.3 million people? Well played John Smith
The guys going on about legality, proper officers and standing orders give off the same energy as everybody who kept going on about common law and the Magna Carta during this latest lockdown.
5:47 Gollum.
They remind me of the creepy council from Hot Fuzz😂
Best reality show in 2020 - Love Island Best reality show in 2021: Handforth Parish Council Planning & Environment Committee
England
All the men are just having a laugh I love it
The grasp of the democratic process by FAR too many people in UK is tenuous in the extreme as this recording shows.  Add to that their resort to ''kangaroo courts'' which, in their absence, try, find guilty and execute elements who oppose their right-wing values would out Kafka Mr Kafka himself. What is not revealed is that these Parish Cllrs claim to be ''Independent'' and not aligned to any Party Political group.
What a bunch of bullies. Unacceptable. Good on her.
Am increasingly suspecting Armando Iannucci behind this. Thank you if so!!!x
most sense from Julie's ipad
John smith seems a good guy 😂
Don’t don’t she’s just kicked him out!!
Nice work HADS!
Agent Smith.
Aleds iPad - "don't". Just imagine them down the high street on a Saturday night, Aled getting held back by dad,  "he's not worth it son, just leave it".
This is what council meetings are like folks.   They are a hotbed of politics and back stabbing.
Jackie better read the standing orders, read them and understand them😂😂😂
Obviously this is Handforth Amateur Dramatics Society - and well done you. An hilarious farce! Adorable.
Is this how posh people beef
Things have been pretty rotten of late but this cheered me up no end. Very very amusing! For any foreign national watching this I bet most of them think  this is a typical meeting here in U.K.  All I can say is, yep it probably is, but this ones great!
And the world thought the English were polite.  Not with each other.
@16:15 “ I think if this goes viral on the internet “ . Prophetic words lol  !!!
What a time to be alive
David Firth could have written this.
Ian Ball is the unsung hero in this saga. The photographic evidence of the other gentleman's moniker will be instrumental in how the plot unfolds over the longer term.
Where's the chairman?
(unintelligible tantrum noises)  🤣🤣🤣   He sounded like Gollum 🤣
Me @ everyone forever: you have no authority here Jackie weaver
This is the YouTube algorithm jackpot, we all have the winning ticket 😂
BUREAUCRACY = The art of making the possible impossible whilst implementing the wishes of nobody 😏
"You have no authority here Jackie Weaver" is hands down my favourite movie line of all time.
Can't wait to see the Netflix documentary about this ..
The digital world gone mad.
the more i watch the the better it gets
This is season 8 of game of thrones
There's going to be some awkward moments when their local pub reopens...
Oh my god... that is so embarrassing they should all be removed from council
And this, my friends, is how Brexit happened...
Fantastic.
If this is what they’re like on Zoom, makes you wonder what they’re like IRL
But is a clerk the same as a proper officer?!?
Is that a toilet flush at 7:13?
Brian Tolver "you have no authority here Jackie Weaver"  Jackie Weaver "I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. And ill fucking do you if you don't shut up Brian Fucking Tolver!!!!"
I have absolutely no idea what’s going on  (and neither do they) but I love it!
But why is Jackie weaver always reffered to as Jackie weaver? 😂
The sound Sue made at 14:28 killed me.
This is brilliant 😂😂😂
"When do we plan to start?"...  Father Jack: F*ck off...
JOHN SMITH
At least they got a lot done once Jackie sorted out the disruptive members
I am laughing all the way from Canada lol. Just finish my zoom exam and I needed that laugh lol
So who is the chairman?
I cannot get further than 'QUITE RIGHTLY' without dying
I’m moving to Handforth!!
For some reason you get a lot of ego maniacs in parish communities not sure why
Alan Murdoch is that character that only gets introduced in the third season but is still everyone's favourite
Holy titshake earlier this video had like 50K views now it's at 1 million and #1 on Trending
5:49 "(unintelligible tantrum noises)"
Jackie Weaver; Handforth’s Putin.  I’m sure this meeting must have been scripted for YouTube. British Comedy at its best.
mickey mouse parish council unfortinatly there everywhere and get nothing of any significance done just argueing with each other priceless
Will someone tell me who the fuck is the chairman vice chairman co chairman clerk how does anyone know what’s going on?!?!?
Send this to people that think govt's are capable of world changing conspiracies! haha!
I love that no one on the council knows who the other guy at Aled’s house is.
That chairman was an asshole, she was right to kick him out.
Jackie Weaver is having a great time clearly
Hot fuzz sequel looks good
Imagine how well young people are represented in this area.
What was Julie doing at 3.27?????
6 minutes in when Voldemort tries to join the council 🐍
Gandalf: Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the chairman
this is just perfect comedy
I've sat in school committees and school council meetings, ran by and governed by the students and they have a far far more respectful way to conduct their meetings. The way this meeting began demonstrates all that is wrong with councils up and down the country, some very good counsellors with sound intent and good direction are bullied by long standing bigots who believe their positions are irrefutable and hide behind 'law' to protect their grip on the past
I live in Handforth. I'll be looking out for Jackie Weaver in the local Tesco Express 🤟🤟🤟  For anyone wondering, this IS England right now. I'm so ashamed to be British 🤣🤣🤣
Jackie Weaver reminds me of Dustin Hoffman dressed up in the film Tootsy..but only in looks..she comes across as a jumped up frustrated old bint..
Pompous gits all of them.....do they get paid
What I find most amazing about this is it is 18 minutes long, yet not a single thing was actually said.
This sums up British politics. Embarrassing.
John Smith to be played by Bradley Walsh
someone obviously has an inferiority complex and unable to accept a Female running a meeting
They're fighting over who gets to be Clark Griswold?
“A subcommittee *of* the Steering Group.”
I spent 20 years on a Parish Council and never witnessed such behaviour.
The quality of UK Government :)
Jackie Weaver the Facist dictator of Handforth
Terrifyingly accurate
5:48 ????
This is the most confusing thing I have ever seen 🤔
The poetry of PC Clerk saying you have now power here Jackie , then getting booted out hahahaha
I've still no idea who the chairman is haha😂😂😂
“Turf war” 🤣🤣🤣
I'm sure that Jackie Weaver is a caricature. She's an amalgamation of every officious old public sector spinster I've ever had the misfortune of working or dealing with. BRING BACK THE CHAIRMAN! Ha ha!
sue clearly likes to be heard
watching this and reading all the funny comments has really cheered me up. thanks hilarious
whats with the guy with golums voice?
Did anyone else notice the simmering anger from Guitar Baldy
Cynthia at all times: “NO”
He/They can't do it
big john smith fan icl
Well ive got a photo of it ahahaha what a grass
I like Ian Ball, he’s sharp. Guess you could say he’s...on the Ball
JACKIE WEAVER. The Destroyer, The Creator, But most importantly, The meeting host.
Jackie: We can now elect a new chair Vice Chair: No you cant because im here Jackie: Well we will se about that then wont we!
>MFW I live in Handforth Please I just wanted Councils Abolished.
Bunch of fucking fossils
Fuck knows why we were ever surprised about that referendum result
Who's side are we on, guys? Lol
‘Sat there like a laughing hyena 😠’ -Cyn
My god so many little hitlers. The lot need bining.
"The chairman of the council is the chairman of the council". A very valid point.
"We can't get on, we're blocked."   "We're blocked against what?"  haha this is amazing
This poem seems pretty relevant :D (Credit to AnonyNurse on Facebook)  A Puppet’s Guide to Feeling VERY IMPORTANT   For advancement many puppets have such need, Ambition equalled only by their greed; But narcissists with power as their goal, Oft’ come a cropper on the greasy pole. But, worry not, Young Puppet, there are things To elevate you, (other than your strings); Consider with me now the nitty gritty, Of what it means to be on a committee: The beauty of committees?  Number one - You can sit for hours whilst not a thing gets done. No bright ideas? The easiest solution: Debate at length upon the constitution – And minutes can need hours of revision, (Throw in buzz-words ‘mission statement’, ‘forward vision’)… No-one need know that you don’t have a clue What your committee’s really meant to do; Learn to shuffle papers and look grave, Practise your sneer and curt, dismissive wave And if – a dream come true – you make the Chair, Perfect a crushing ‘over glasses’ stare. Should anyone object and things unravel, Drown out dissenting voices!  Bang your gavel! To make it to the Big ‘Ouse you’re on track, So don’t let being stupid hold you back! Strut down those hallowed corridors – aren’t you curious? For glory, though reflected, still feels glorious! May a polished desk reflect your noble face, May a squishy leather chair your bum embrace! So rest assured, you need no real ability, Just little sense and much less sensibility…                                                               Anony Nurse
I’m 4 mins in and all I hear is ‘where’s the chairman?’ 🤣 these ppl are absolutely uncivilised! It’s hilarious
The opening shot of Roger Small spinning around like a James Bond villain kills me.
Laughing Hyena 😂🤣
Fantastic!!! If only ALL council meetings and members were like this it would be worth paying the council tax in Newbury Berkshire!!!!! More please guys!!!
Its like something from Midsummer Murders, which ones the killer, my money's on Britney Spears. Toxic
Peter Moore is an unsung hero, he's been though some shit you can tell
Aled having a battle with Gollum at 6.05 😭😂
Well this was productive.
I thought Jackie was going to be the villain but turns out she is the hero
Surely this justifies a new juicy soap to rival Corrie, Enders And Emmerdale etc !
17 minutes of nonsense! Did this meeting even have an agenda; i dont really even know what they were talking about!
John Smith is my mood for 2021 😂😂
All my homies hate the chairmen
Jackie Weaver "Erm, Erm, Erm" People say Erm when they are about to lie or tell you some bullshit
Carry on Councillor
🙄🙄🙄
Watching this incompetence is like watching a fly fail to get through an open window..
This is why Britain doesn't have its own version of the Westwing Hha.
when i thought about my home of Cheshire having its moment I didn’t think this would be it
what even is this?
My friday evening sorted 👌 waiting for part 2
Another sunny day on Plague Island
"subcommittee of the steering group" is peak parish politics.
This so chaotic.  I LOVE it😭
"Yeah I'm gonna subpoena everybody"  ??????????????????????????????????????????????????
So I guess the Chairman did actually have a point that Jackie Weaver wasn't acting properly within the framework of the meeting but he put his message across in such a rude, overly authoritative, derogatory and overbearing way that his point just disappeared to be replaced by his old skool Victorian school teacher attitude!!!! He speaks with the arrogance of someone not used to being questioned in life
When everyone was thinking about Cyberpunk, this legendary event took place and nobody knew about it...
Can we all be respectful to Jackie weaver. I mean Britney Spears please! 😂🤣😂🤣😂
“a subcommittee of the steering group”
I'm the chairman of.the council lol
“You have no authority here Jackie Weaver!” Jackie Weaver: *and I took that personally*
What a bunch of clowns !!!....they're not fit for the circus,let alone a council.
And these are the morons who decide planning issues. They're all a disgrace!!
The Gollum like, 'we're having a teams meeting you fool!' is just sublime.
WHO LEAKED IT THOUGH
This is why old people shouldn’t have technology 😂
Glad to see Monty Python is back and better than ever
Jackie Weaver sure pulled a Peppa Pig goodbye on them.
YOU CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN'T!
I hate these men
this is the best thing of 2021
Wow, never in my life I seen a Parish Council Meeting behave like this!  Justice for Jackie Weaver who was trying to referee this meeting. Shocking!
This women is a self important dictator!
"YOU CAN'T!"...  Was anyone else expecting "WELL there's no need for THAT!" in response?
This is why the village grass gets cut in the middle of a drought.
What was your underlying motivation for posting this?
Sub-committee of the sub-committee of the sub-com-  *Fucking Gollum appears*
This is bureaucracy manifest.
idk how you can watch this video and be surprised that a majority of brits voted for brexit
"Do me"
You have no authority Jackie Weaver.....cut off 😂
Give em hell
Its like Sandford in Hot Fuzz lmao
Is handforth PC Clerk an angry Herbert the pervert ?
7:25 Almost 4 precious minutes given over to the topic of Barry having changed his name on Zoom, and how he could have done that.
Jackie Weaver gets things done. Welcome to Tottenham Jackie.  #JoseOut #JackieIn
Omydays this is hilarious 🤣
Wish he'd said "Jackie Weaver.... Welcome to Gunforth"
oh hiya i’m, yeah, i’m just in a meeting at the moment. can i give you a call back when it finishes? okay, alright, bye, byeee!
Way to many egos there me thinks
i’m just wondering why this is #1 on trending
A sub-comittee, we must have a sub-comittee. To report back to this comittee. Jesus wept.
what a thumbnail
Just a typical council meeting in this great country of ours. It's like a Victoria Wood sketch 🤣 Probably similar to a Cabinet meeting
Can I ask who is right?
Andy Burnhams lost his touch
I can't believe that they still use Standing Orders!
6:20  "My...my...my first point is to apologise to Jackie, but welcome to Handforth"  *longest awkward silence as John Smith waits for laughter that never arrives*
This is giving me Vicar of Dibley vibes
Biden is not the real president either
A scene straight out of The Thick Of It! It's just missing Malcolm Tucker 😂
Zoom waiting room is the 21st century detention room where disruptive kids are sent
Just waiting for capt. Mainwaring to arrive and cpl Jones to shout “don’t panic “
he missed the meetings that weren’t held....that’s irrelevant...  🤔🤔🤔🤔.   🤯
5:48: Gollum enters the meeting
Can we have them all on big brother be like a care home
And this ladies and gentlemen is why England is England
Did I hear Jenny Eclair say "I'm sorry I'm in a meeting"......................3:05
This is embarrassing
THE CHAIR "you have no authority here Jackie Weaver; no authority at all!"  JACKIE WEAVER uses Dr Evil's chair switch console
Need to see an animated version of this
Is there a season 2 on Netflix?
Sue definitely fancies Alan
Everyone saying "you're muted Ian" all flustered when this man is the only one following Jackie Weaver's instruction and muting his bloody mic
This might appear funny but we have to bear in mind these idiots hold a lot of power such as planning. We also pay them considerable sums of money via our taxes. They should resign particularly the first Chairman. Disgraceful.
Jackie Weaver acted beyond her post clearly
0:10  0:35 2:20 3:00 3:30 - 6:22 6:52 - 9:45 13:30
Roger Small; turning to the camera set the tone for this chaotic 18 minutes
This is the greatest meeting known to man #Freethechariman
You couldn't write this s**t
Reality in a pandemic. It does not matter anymore who is elected...it matters who can throw you out of the zoom meeting. ;-)
Please tell me someone else thinks Cyn looks like ThatVeganTeacher
That ''Eurghhh'' at 14:32 made me choke on my tea.
All joking aside, if you haven't read the YouTube comments standing orders AND UNDERSTOOD THEM then you have NO AUTHORITY TO COMMENT HERE.
I feel like all of human history led us to this moment. The pinnacle. It made this possible.
16:26 "we don't want a turf war breaking out" bwahahaha
I was hoping for a new episode of League of gentleman  - this will do
I am clark of Handforth parish council
Toilet flush 7.18?
Is that a toilet flushing at 7:10? 😂
No idea where Handforth is but it's on the Map now 🤩
So much for the British « Keep Calm » motto
Are we not going to talk about Julie's iPad?
Typical British absolute chaos very apt for our time  Full of short tempered power crazed nobody's with teeth as yellow as their underwear
I'm gonna go and watch Hot Fuzz again, immediately.
Robin Williams is back!!!
This could only happen in england
Posh people should not be in charge
John Smith just vibing
Now...are we absolutely SURE these aren't actors? Because this is unbelievable!
17:00 without john we wouldn't be here watching this travesty, many thanks to him.
Julie's iPad taking a call at 02:58 and saying she's just in a meeting! ;)
What was this meeting about exactly?
O dear o dear o dear
Their shouting your ‘muted’ at someone who’s muted! 😂
Erm... erm... erm use proper words or don't bother. In total, collectively they must have said erm about 1000 times!
what a bunch of useless ,power crazed , middle class busy bodies :-(
We can be respectful to Jackie and can we?
This is 1 on trending
The EU: "It's been a month and a bit since Brexit, wonder how the UK's getting on?"  The EU: watches video  The EU: "Oh wow. Utter anarchy, then."
...And at 5.57 Gollum (Ala Aled Brewerton) is looking beyond the ring...
This is spiffingly, pompously, hyena laughingly, fantastically, Britishly, Jackie Weaver-ey amazing stuff.
Welcome to Del Boca Vista Cheshire!!! 😎 OMG, that TOILET FLUSH!!! 😂😂😂
"The man is a complete disgrace" "Okay thank you Peter.."  I have cried laughing 🤣🤣
Lmao thanks Chatr
7:20 The proof that this is a legit call
Quintessential English love this
Uks own version of tiger King. We could call it parish Council king and Jackie weaver is the new Carol Baskin lol
Think Mrs Doubtfire handled the situation very well indeed!
4:22 - did Ronnie Pickering enter the meeting?
I can't believe this has made the 6 O'Clock news. Grown ups behaving badly. Absolutely brilliant. 😂😆🤭
They could take this on tour and people would pay to see it live!
This is one for the history books.
What even is a parish council? Is it related to church?
When Mr Small's name appeared on screen showing an empty chair I thought how small is he? ha ha!
What a plonk Jackie Weaver is.
Haha this could become a soap opera- I would seriously watch the adventures of Handforth Council for an hour every evening on itv 😂
Highlight timestamps: 0:08 - under the breath 2:11 - will you stop talking 2:56 - the phone rings 4:04 - read them 5:08 - the chairman is the 5:18 - be respectful 5:41 - Gollum 7:12 - toilet flush 09:36 - Britney  10:35, 13:03  - denied 11:09 - the entrance of Alan Murdoch 13:32 - didn't attend the meetings.. 16:12 - Nostradamus  Please add yours below for me to edit them in
Get jackie as prime minister .bit like maggie thatcher .
If Zoom don’t get this mob , especially Jackie as part of their next advertising campaign. They have missed a golden opportunity . Quick maths
1.2M views in a day I love this country
god I love Sue
Serious stuff
this has made me realise how much i wanna see a vicar of dibley zoom meeting now
"We're trying to have a TEAMS meeting, my precious"
CHAIRMAN: "You can't kick me out" Jackie kicks the Chairman out.
Why does the vice chairman sound like Gollum
So when is the next episode??
18 minutes later and I still haven't figured out what the meeting was about!   Some top class entertainment from 'Aled's iPad' though - and a classic 'fuck off' only ten seconds into this first class parish council comedy gold.   Big up to Jackie for being cool as all while dealing with some utter halfwit geriatrics...
25 years Jackie hasn’t seen a letter like it.... poor Madam Beavers  Christ Ian stop muting
As a resident of Cheshire East I can confirm that this meeting is the perfect example of bullying
Anyone else waiting on the vicar of Dibley popping up?
Is this what my hard earned council tax pays for - utter joke !!!   Not a single clue between them....
David pincombe was right. A war of words has begun. Part two needed
So this is the whingy millennial comment section
So typical...Shes amazing wish we had her in Fuckenham
Really very ridiculous. For heaven's sake, these people are supposed to be adults.
They need to invest in some Zoom hosting training 😂
I know they seem like they turn pretty fast, but it seems like this i clearly not the first time they've been through this before. They pretty much start off on the edge.
this plays out like a D&D encounter
what the fuck are they talking about I feel like I'm listening to someone having a stroke
I still have no idea what this meeting was about 😂😂
“YOU’RE MUTED IAN”
"For political gain". They're on a Parish Council !!! It doesnt get any lower than that unless Sue gets her way and sets up a sub committee.
England in a nutshell
Tbf Jackie going on a banning spree instigated it all by throwing out the chairman
The chairman of the council is the chairman of the ........ er council
This is incredible, best youtube vid of 2021 !!!! Nutcases!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Aled chose violence that day
We truly live in a boomerocracy
"My first point is to apologise to Jackie but welcome to Handforth" :DDD
I've been in so many meetings like this in my life.  Wonderful, simply wonderful!!
05:55 to listen to demon voices from another dimension
"FUCK OFF" 0:11
Jackie is a champ
Cyn: "It's not like walking on eggshells, it's like walking on glass."  She has the best character arc imo
why is this trending
Great video,keep it up!
Starts off petty, goes downhill from there....
Why are council meetings such a big deal? Dear God...
The breakdown at 5:50 is magnificent
04:25 made me laugh so much. "Read the standing orders. AND UNDERSTAND THEM!"
I have no idea what’s happening but thoroughly enjoyed every second of this 😂
Team Chairman and Vice Chairman here. Jackie Weaver is power mad
Oblivion NPC interactions
This might be the closest we ever get to the Vicar of Dibley again
Coming soon to Netflix. HANDFORTH.  THE FINAL MEETING... Starring Dame Judy Dench  as Jackie Weaver  Stephen Graham is "the clerk"  Jodie Comer as Cyn.  Also starring  Matt Lucas as Sue and Sue Perkins is John Smith.  It's the role I was born to play says Dench.
They really could have handled this with an email ...
Has Count Arthur Strong seen this, and if not, why not??!!
Came from Bradley hall
Barry burkhill 😂
Reminds me of trying to play D&D on roll 20
John smith having a liccle giggle and no one else saying anything is so funny to me 5:05
At least my tax payers money has been put to good use for a change! Great entertainment.
a bit of power, completely incompetent.
Absolute scenes
Why is this #1 on Trending?
David Pincombe knew!
This lot need an Urgent Covid Arts Council Grant,  helicoptered into Handforth.   They've put it on the map and for everyone's Summer Staycation Venue.  Wiki informs me that  Handforth-cum-Bosden was part of the Stockport Registration District between 1837 and 1877. Wow !  2,000 houses about to be built. OOpph thats not right. Protest due and soon .  "The Chairman of The Council is ....er ..um...the Chairman....Of ....The...Council.."     The Chairman has a bruising demeanour with as much charisma as Beachy Head, Holyhead, and Birkenhead all rolled into one.  Jackie, Minute that!! . We must have the next meeting broadcast on terrestrial and satellite, shall we say, 1st April 2021 at Noon.   Jackie Weaver is the spouse with the mouse,  the clerk with the bark, she has the power to point & click The Chairman out of the Room & out of Zoom like a piece of dog chewed spam.  Kerrrrrrpowwwwwwwwwww...Click    Wake up Parliament, Wake up Lords, this is the way to engage  .  I don't want to take my own Argos pen to the voting booth..cos there wont be a stubby pencil on a string.  I want to tick or click with my laser mouse. WHO IS ALAN MURDOCH  (to be contd.)  Well done Peter Public Person...no spit or saliva was shared in this meeting..So all in all a result ..There's only one Jackie Weaver
fun to see a microcosm of england devolve into a poorly developed nation.
OH my God.      I've had a laugh I hadn't had in  years.    May not be funny....    And I have experienced these meetings in the USA too, in case it makes you feel better.
I've been to so many meetings like this. We English like to discuss important matters like this. Once I attended a meeting where people discussed whether or not there was a hole in the road and whether or not the hole, if it did in fact exist, was offensive to others. It took us quite a long time to get to the bottom of the matter.
It's like the Spinal Tap of council meetings.
David Pincombe - "I think if this goes viral on the internet..." oooopppss
'shes kicked Barry out'...... even better
“Could you be respectful to Jackie weaver” *hysterical laughing* Some bloke out of nowhere: SUBPOENA
This is hilarious 😂
'I take charge'....... classic
Pitchforks at the ready, councillors.
ILLEGALLY
https://youtu.be/TIom8EYNHaA
1.1 million views in one day?! Wow! I can see why though- mega entertaining. Ive got my popcorn ready.
"DO NOT QUOTE THE DEEP MAGICKS TO ME, JACKIE WEAVER, I WAS THERE WHEN THEY WERE WRITTEN!"
Cyn is a diamond
Thank you coronavirus for giving us this gold!
I have never been prouder of my country XD
5:45 golem
I swear if this masterpiece doesn’t end up in Tate Modern I will riot
Why is this on my recommended
Parish councils are a waste of time.   Nothing ever gets done as an example perfectly shown here.  And an unnecessary addition to our council tax bills.
“That’s rich coming from you in Birkenhead.” 😂😂😂😂
Hilarious!  Love it!!  "Carry On Councillors" lol.
What about the man who holds up the white hand of saruman!
We all know a know-it-all cow like Jackie Weaver
I downloaded this thing but it's so low quality that it downloaded in 2 seconds 😂
Jackie Weaver is a BAD ASS!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣💪💪💪💪💪
5:45 Gollum makes an appearance... 😂
"Appalling behaviour"
Almost 1.2 million views in 2 days. Wow.
John Smith half the internet has now heard your dulcet tones. It’s like a Dad’s Army sketch ..
This is awful behavior!
Assistant to the Regional Manager
The chairman of the council is the chairman of the council 😂😂😂
Wow emmerdale live
She didn’t like it so kicked people out and tried to take over the meeting !! ...
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM  where’s the chairman gone?
Stand up for yourself, leave the meeting, leave her on her tod and start a new meeting under the right processes.  Then ban her from the new session.
You have no authority Jackie weaver, none at all.   She’s just kicked him out
https://youtu.be/xNZFpgEhDWI

https://youtu.be/xNZFpgEhDWI
Why make it avalible. it just makes them look like nincompoops
Welcome to Handforth ;o)
julies i pad my hero
This is comedy gold. I'm surprised no-one was threatened with the comfy chair.
I love how the self-appointed Clerk shouted "will you STOP talking" like a substitute teacher when the class is fucking about
This lot make the Dibley council look sane
Brilliant
Did someone flush the toilet at https://youtu.be/lgGmYeAm0jk?t=433
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!
There's a vacancy? I want in on this shit! 😂
And those people make decisions for us!!!!  So rude and unprofessional hope the Monitoring Officer can sack them!
So Monty Python was reality based
Why does the old bloke at the start sound like Richard from the undatables
This is like a Middle Class version of Game of Thrones, on Zoom
Who is in the right here? Jackie or the councillors?
The chairman of the council is the... the... the uhhh... the chairman of the council!
John smith just laughing along makes it funnier
HERE COMES THE SUBPOENAAAA
When is this on Netflix? for the remaster?
SHES KICKED IMMMM OUT
This is what my local party meetings are Like. Petty moaning and arguing. Pathetic people acting like children over a pack of sweets.
I bet the Jocks will be swizzled with envy at the rise of English Chaoticism....  Nicola Sturgeon, beat this if you can for general ineptitude. We’ve got you on the ropes with our small minded pettiness.
Why has this only come to light now? It was in December
“If this goes viral on the...   ... on the internet or Facebook or whatever”.
@5:53, I'm surprised no one has pointed the brief moment Satan joined the chat.
This feels like a bunch of school kids winding up a supply teacher
This is pathetic. An example of childish adults who cannot communicate with each other.
We’re all coming to visit to see this wonderful place  have you got a cafe and gift shop ?
Jackie Weaver desolve the senate and execute order 66
I hate to see what the Youth council version of this is
Anyone who knows their stuff, who was in right or wrong here? Was it the first guy PC whatever or this Jackie? Or Aled's Pad/Barry
This is like the parish council on Vicar of Dibley lmao
"You have no authority here, Jackie Weaver! NO AUTHORITY AT ALL!"  ~ Jackie Weaver instantly asserts her authority ~
When bureaucracy goes wrong 😂
HaNdFoRtH PaRiSh CoUnCiL
This couldn’t have been written better as a comedy sketch.  From the woman taking a phone call in the meeting; the F off comment; the man stood with his back to the camera 🤣; the chairman being kicked out; Alan bring on the naughty step etc
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM
I don’t think I am mistaken but I’m sure this tribe also double up as the Brexit negotiating team.
I actually found this video heartwarming 🤣
If this is council level, imagine what the government are like.    Who needs a BBC licence, classic British comedy.   By the way it should not be easy to change a constitution,  speak to Americans about that.
5:49 with subtitles is the best...  'unintelligible tantrum noises'
This is wild. Christ
It’s Brexit all over again!
Zoom being so crap adds to it with the delays 😂
The most childish bunch of senior citizens all in one virtual room .  Hilarious
Is he saying "clark" or "clerk"?
The scarey thing is these people were once relevant to our society...
RELEASE THE LETTER!
One of the funniest  things I have ever heard. I must have played this about 5 times now and I can' stop laughing...however some of the amazing and funny comments people have written are nearly as good. Thanks for cheering up my day all of you!!
I would love to see Winston Churchill on a Zoom call.
Schmoyoho should songify this.
‘We did put the disruptive members in the waiting room’  Jackie Weaver - 2020
Petty and utterly shambolic.  God help Us!
“F**k off” is a good way to start a zoom meeting
Why is nobody talking about Julie's I pad's gasp at 3:27 when she realises she's not on mute and everyone heard her phone call.
Did anyone hear at approximately 7:09 Roger Smith, when saying he will formulate an official reply to that letter, the toilet being flushed sound effect? PLEASE SHOW US THIS LETTER.
What a bunch of complete wallies. Does anything ever get done in Handforth?  I was a Parish Councillor myself many years ago and I never encountered anything like this pantomime. Should any of these people really be in office?
I felt compelled to attend a PC meeting as the farmer adjacent was trying to push through a dodgy development on his property. He was chairman and the majority of members were acolytes dependent on him for business or income. An hour in I was losing the will to live, hoping a client of mine would text me as he usually did of an evening for an urgent requirement so I would have the excuse to leave......alas that didn't happen. After two hours of using 20 words where one would suffice on the first agenda item, the no-nonsense tweedy lady District Councillor lost patience and exclaimed: 'stop waffling, get on with it or I'll knock your silly heads together!".  I don't recall the outcome, as by then I was too busy gnawing my own leg off in frustration.
How has it got this bad
See how that guy turns around at the start like he's in an 80's day time soap opera actor.
Jackie is a legend. When I first saw the 2 minute clip I thought she was in the wrong. This video is gold. Go on Britney Spears!
I think that Stephen Graham should play the "read them and understand them" guy in the movie adaptation.
It's like the adult version of playing schools
This is pure comedy.I love it ,makes you proud to be British!!gordblesser !!
The Handforth Parish Council have spoken with one voice: "No, no, no, no, no, no, YES"
I won’t sleep until I know who Julie’s I pad was on the phone to.
this what 3 lockdowns does to people
Welcome to Last of the Summer Wine in 2021. Gold.
My only wish in life is to know if they ever pass any plans ?
The conviction in Sue’s voice when saying that Alan should be let back into the meeting as a member of the public- I’m glad there are still people in government who stand up for the people.
5:50 Gollum has entered the chat
May I present you "The Government".
I have never laughed so much since the start of this pandemic!! Absolute comedy gold give them their own series!!
Are all of these guys paid from Tax payers money?
I second that.
Poor Jackie!!
4:06 "She's just kicked him out!" "Don't."
Never seen anything like it!!!!
Absolutely brilliant
I was not disappointed by the zoom call OR the comments. It kinda reminded me a bit of an awkward sketch in The League of Gentlemen crossed with Midsomer Murders. How wonderfully British 😂
Jackie Weaver: I am the senate Handforth PC Clerk: Not yet
Is that Ian Ball or Angelos Epithemiou???
Why are the like counts disabled, 99.99% likes 0.01% dislikes provided by the people stuck in the zoom waiting room for being naughty lmao
The funniest sitcom pilot in years. I hope they make a full series.
Nevermind the impression of a laughing hyena, I found the impression of Gollum at 5:55 most inappropriate (but also rather good)
My favourite part is when Gollum has a cameo at 5:48 🙊😅
Classic little Englanders, glad I live over the wall.
I am the vice chair!!! 😂😂 What a chunt
RESPECT MY local AUTHORITY
This is like Game of Thrones, you don’t expect all the major characters to be killed off so early, but they are.
I’d like to have a drink with the vice chair
Get this on Netflix!
Did someone whisper ‘f off’ near the start? I need to re-run it. Who’s meant to be in charge there, it’s usually the Chairperson, but it seems more like the Jackie character, do your homework Jackie, before the meeting.
I have to google what point of order is
Trying to work out the Aled READ THE STANDING ORDERS Brewerton set up.  That's presumably his dad he's got cackling manically beside him on the sofa.  So is it his mother or wife he's screaming dog's abuse at off-camera?    Does Mrs Brewrton need an intervention?
What an utter shambles - would recommend.
This has to be a comedy ploy this cannot be real is it lol in stitches
You have no authority here Jackie Weaver
Women like Jackie Weaver are responsible for the downfall of Western Culture.
John Smith "can we make this recording available?" He knew!
What was the point of this meeting?
The first ten seconds is like a cold opening of a found footage horror movie.
anyone else hear the f*ck off after the 'chair' asks when are we planning to start?"
5:48, puzzuzu from exorcist has joined the call. Turns into Gollum after a few seconds. Incredible!
It’s nothing if but lively in Handforth 🤣🤣
Best movie of 2021. Hope the Oscars doesn’t snub this
Hi, could someone tell me what TV show this is and if it's available on VHS? I wish to buy it for my parents.
Why can I not stop watching this?😂😂
wow i hate old people
Doesn’t this just illustrate the worst of middle class England? White, middle aged to elderly, middle class, misogynist bullies. Parish councils just give them the ideal forum to display their ignorance. Certain individuals in this meeting should be ashamed of themselves.
This gets better watching it more than once. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 missed the pantos at Christmas so February panto will do
They should all resign. What a joke. Not one of them is representing their residents interests.
Is... Is this a new BBC3 sitcom?
Handforth Parish Council: the white people are not all right
Politicians in action!   No wonder governments around the world have been creating one clusterf*^k after another in their handling of this pandemic.
The whole meeting seems to be an argument about the argument they had last time :)  Is this the right room for an argument?
Well, Britney was fierce as always
This meeting is more fragile than Cheshire Cheese. I love my home county.
This has to be the best video of 2021, nothing will come close!
WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE A TEAMS MEETING, YOU FOOL!!
Complete fucking CHAOS. Monty Python couldn't have written a better episode. "HE IS NOT THE CLERK OF PARISH COUNCIL!!" thunders one mighty voice above the others. Thunder rumbles in the skies above and a towering dark presence appears above the land. "Who is Alan Murdoch?" "YES, PLEASE!"  WHO <<<<<>>>>>>IS<<<<<>>>>ALAN<<<<>>>>>>MUUUURRRRRDDDDOCH!!!!!??????<<<<<>>>>>>thunders through the firmament as the heavens rumble (cue lightning flashes, Jackie Weaver descends in CHARIOT OF FIRE)
Where are all their carers? To think we've been clapping for them for the last 10 months, yet they've left all these vulnerable people completely unsupervised.
David Pincombe can see in the future my dudes!
Lots of old white men playing at being important
READ THE STANDING ORDERS!  READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!  4:22
The most british thing ever
The descent into chaos happened sooner than I was mentally prepared for
Chairman: "You have no authority here Jackie Weaver"   Jackie: "I derive my power from a higher authority, not from the parish nor the council but from the monitoring office itself! Do not test me!"
Alan Murdoch is massively underrated in all of this. Great addition.
Howling 😂😂😂😂😂
This is just a small council meeting, I cannot even point Handforth on a map! Can you imagine what it is like in Westminster hahaha
Ian's a right little grass isn't he 🤣
Why do they have the most basic names ever 😂😂😂😂😂
It's only been a day and already you can buy underpants bearing the message:  'YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE JACKIE WEAVER!'
The way Cyn rejected Sue’s olive branch was so cold blooded
Johns in the guest WC on his MacBook.
Vulcan being enters the chat at 14:45.
Not a good feeling watching this, I don't think it's just a Handforth issue looking at the members of the council. I need to take more responsibility to find out about who is making decisions on my behalf in our community. Lesson learned
What the fuck is this boomer shit? Who gave them WiFi? Which of their grandchildren downloaded zoom?
Zoom is going to change English Parish Council meetings forever.
not sure flirting with alan, ma’am keep it in ur pants this is a parish council meeting
I was waiting for someone to yell "If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding. How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?"
Trevor sounds like he has a toy whistle stuck in his throat
0:12 “F... off” hahahahahahahaha
And to think we used to rule the world... how did we end up here
The Vicar Of Dibley meets Staged
Is that Chevy Chase at 11:16??😂
This is currently #1 on trending. This is the world I want to live in!
I've never enjoyed reality TV shows before, but this riveting. Do we have the Zoom meeting for January?  I'd hate to miss an episode.
Vicar of Dibley meets the thick of it meets Julie's iPad
This is more parks and rec than actual parks and rec
The very loud toilet flushing....
The "fuck off" under the breath has me falling off my chair hahaha. The timing is just brilliant hahaha
Can't wait for episode 2. When is it?  Tuesday the.....wait my diary is here somewhere!
Why is this no #1 trending?
media students will be analysing this video for years to come. a show stopping piece of cinema
Absolute dross
The “Fuck Off” at the start is priceless
*everyone talking politely*  Sue attempting to destroy everyones ears: "MAAAAAAAAY I"
I've seen more progress made in the Parish Meetings of Dibley.
God save the queen
Welcome to peak democracy
This is perfect. I love it.
11:07 Not gonna lie, I thought that was Roger Small's head - HOW SMALL IS HE?
*is muted* Ian: Sorry, severe lag on the system
If only they'd review some fast food during the meeting, they'd get even more views.
You are muted, Ian 🤣🤣 Story of my life on Teams!   Julie 'Britney' Weaver is a Legend!
5:53 good to see Gollum involved in local council
The squeaky voiced 'chairman' and his acolytes are complete knobheads. Bunch of tiresome, nasty old farts.
Thank you twitter 😂😂😂
Peter Moore is a real one
Wow. Some of those blokes have the manners of salted slugs.
Sequel please !
I just love this!
Jesus Christ no wonder councils across England can't do shite
5:45 reminded me of Steve pemberton off league of gentlemen lol
John smith is real
oh my god has it been taken down????
Underrated line from Ian Ball  8:03 - "I have taken a photograph of it"   *proceeds to look very pleased with himself*
05:48 did he audition for Lord of the Rings and Downfall? He sounds like a mixture of Gollum and Hitler
Is that the F bomb  11 seconds in. I’m crying.
Shame the disrespectful ones are the young ones. The older ones carry themselves with pure class.
This is my favourite play from William Shakesweaver.
"We've been walking on ice here for the last 6 months" "Ice? ice?we've been walking on glass,  my feet are cut to ribbons",  "That's because you're a Scouser".  For everyone wondering how the the country got into such a sorry state, here's the answer. Every local council, every committee, every sub- committee of every steering committee everywhere,  here you all are. Mind your remit now. Just as well the pubs are shut. Classic.
I don't think there will ever be made a video better than this.
I bet this is how the tory government acts in cabinet meetings
David predicting the future
This is a messsss
Anyone know if any of them have given an interview following it going viral?  🤣  I'm guessing 'Handforth Clerk  Guy' won't be too happy!  lmao
Can we be respectful to Jackie weaver Everyone: The funniest shit they’ve ever heard
Remember to stand outside and clap for Jackie Weaver at 8pm tonight 👏🏽👏🏽 #absolutelegend
WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE A TEAMS MEETING YOU FOOL
The sub-committee of the steering group. This is the type of thing that brought down the Soviets.
Like my comment if you like me live in handthorth!!
More bonkers than the vicar of dibley
So chairman, albeit late, shall we get this meeting started?  3:18 cuts to Barry Burkhill. Saying nothing. Facing the other way.   Fucking sensational. Nearly shat myself 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Now I see that Midsummer Murders was based on Handforth village.
John Smith is the leader we need in these dark and troubling times
There's a book/tv show/film in this.
And to think the British invaded all but 22 countries in the world to teach them to be "civilized" and "proper".
Send them all to Myanmar! :)
how the fk can you not attend a meeting that was never held in the first place 🤣
Anyone else getting Vicar of Dibley vibes 😂
Now this is what I call a reality show.
5:49 Golumn enters the chat
This is so English. Small minded pedants trying to score petty points over something that really really doesn’t matter at all....
Thanks goodness “John Smith” had the sense to hide behind an alias!
If this proves anything, it's that you can't survive as a leader if you have a really high voice.
I didn't know Golem was part of the Parish Council.
Imagine being less organised than Minecraft clans ran by 12 year olds.
This is brilliant.
How do these idiots have the jobs they have, honestly embarrassing
The Vice-Chairman needs his own iPad so that he can either into the fray properly!
Tell me, friend when did Aled's Ipad, abandon reason for madness
Let's be real here Peter Moore is the true chad
Oh, yes, and Barry Burkhill - pull yer finger out! You contributed nowt to the whole thing! You weren't even facing the right way!!!
"The chairman of the council is the chairman of the council."
Don't mess with the weaver!!!
To be fair, an equivalent meeting in certain other less fortunate parts of the world would have ended with people firing rocket propelled grenades at each other.
Jumped up over paid clerks, on gold plated ring fenced pensions. All at rate payers expebpnse.
Did I hear someone say at the beginning "Fuck Off"?!!
Man...my small town committee meetings are really going to have to up their game to compete with this splendor
5:41 is one of the funniest things i've seen for a long time
Pompous idiots.  The vice sounds demonic
I've been told by someone that lives there that Tolver declined £4,000 of donated money to buy food for people struggling through lockdowns.  He is abhorrent and now everyone can grapple with understanding why he's been voted in for decades.
"I'm Jackie Weaver!" " No, I'M Jackie Weaver!!!!"
are you the judeans peoples front ?
Can we make this into a play?
Still a better love story than Twilight.
The behaviour is shocking. I think they need to have a rules and regulations meeting ASAP. Preferably overseen by a neutral party. Everyone is behaving like six year olds. It’s appalling and disrespectful
This is one of the funniest things I've seen this week... Like watching a load of kids in an online school class. 🤣😂😂
I pad
I waiting to see the prequel where he was 'quite rightly' thrown out last time
Not many people hear the "fuck off" at the beginning 😂
This will be in everyone's recommended in a few years 😂😂😂
Tag yourselves, I'm Julie's iPad.
With those black and white titles at the start - I thought it was the new Woody Allen movie.
Ok, I’m new here, but this is AMAZING! I’ve never actually seen a meeting about a meeting before. Simply hilarious!
At this point Cynthias just disagreeing with everyone
#PrayForAmerica
priceless! nothing as small minded and bureaucratic as English local politics!
4:20 Anarchy ensues
Hahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣 the lot of them need to grow up!
“When do we plan to start?”  “Phhhhuck off”
Like zoom on acid.
5:50 when did Voldemort turn up to the meeting?
This is like Eddie Booth from Love thy Neighbour. People need to get a life!
OMG!...tiny dictators!....the worlds full of them!....
Hahaha these people are pathetic 😂 but I guess this is their entire world...
"when do we plan to start?" "fuck off" Creasing up over here
Feels like at least a couple of Zoom DnD sessions I've been in
Thanks, I was laughing my a$$ off - I needed it :D
Is this on next week?
nostradamus has nothing on david
Jackie: who’s Allan Murdock Roger:  *YES PLEASE*
I feel like there’s a hidden backstory as to why PC got kicked out of the first meeting, I hope they explore this in the next season
Roger Small;
Can someone explain what they are actually talking about? I can't make sense of this at all. What is the meeting supposed to be about?
These are the people that rule over us.
Sue: 'I haven't got my diary in front of me, sorry'. WHY haven't you got your diary in front of you, Sue? You're in a COMMITTEE meeting! You should ALWAYS have your diary in front of you! For goodness sake, Sue - shape up!!!
The aggression in this is turning hostile 😂
Sue: * makes a point about how if the other memebers behave they can participate * Cyn: NO
This is how Hitler got started. 😂
0:11 who says “f**k off”?😭🤣
This is such a piss take ahah
isnt this paid for by tax payers money? Parish Council. Think I'd be asking for a rebate, a bunch of school kids could do better.
This is like my zoom meetings with my elderly in--laws, Backs of heads, Microphones not muted and various side conversations which they think is only between themselves in the room.
The reboot to Yes Minister's got off to a good start
Let's face it, good job this was on Zoom and not in a physical meeting........and doubly fortunate that they are not in the US with access to firearms.....................just saying......
These are the people who report people for breaking lockdown
9:23 The chairman did it all himself to take over😈
Problem is these people are all old and out of touch now days! But this video is funny lol
8:44 ooooo someone been a little cheeky and tried to take over
Pulling teeth ..... thanks for the entertainment!
“U can’t remove me it’s only the chairman who can remove people from the meeting” Jackie Weaver: sike u thought
Is this real?
When John Smith raises his nose towards the end, he looks a bit like Hannibal Lecter.
Chairman sounds like Richard off the Undateables
This is brilliant
‘When do we plan to start’........🙄’Fuck off’ 🤣🤣🤣🤣genius
This needs to be made into a Netflix series
Reminds me of that education cttee meeting from New York last year.
Haha whats with ‘fuck off’ during the start 🤣
Thank you to whoever put the subtitles, but you don't need to put "ums" in the subtitles!
I just want to say I hope this doesn't go viral too late sir 😂😂
Rip julie’s iPad 😂
"READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM" is the new "as per my last email"
John Smith has covered his walls with the wool left over from his cardigan. If he stands by the wall he's invisible.
I'm gonna ask, what is a 'parish council' and why is it so important that they have "standing orders"?
we need a channel 4 series on local council meetings
Handforth is ruthless.
So if someone was has made a point and someone doesn't like it your thrown out and portrayed as being a nuisance?! I would get rid of this Jackie Weaver!
I'd love to know the history of the parish council and how Jackie Weaver managed to weave her way to the top.
"I take charge!"... Not today sonny jim.. Booted.
God those bullies at the beginning...Horrible. They should be ashamed.
Are these people paid for doing this?
5:45 errrrm aleds iPad just started making my couch float
You have no authority here Jackie Weaver, none at all 😂😅😂😅😂😅😂
No wonder the environment is going down the plug hole . They never even    got around to it. Priceless.
5:25 Aleds IPad starts laughing for no reason like a maniac
Amazing
Why Tf is this in people’s recommended I’m dying here 😂
@4:17 Buffalo Bill, Vice chair, "I TAKE CHARGE..READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM,"   IT READS THE STANDING ORDERS OR IT GETS THE HOSE AGAIN
5:19 SUE WANTS SOME PROPER BEHAVIOUR FROM MR BURKHILL
Surely you’re not allowed to kick the chairmen outta his own meeting?
Typical of Sue to want to set up a sub-committee. It won't be long before she wants a sub-committee for the sub-committee. That's what Sue's like!
Sovereignty returns to the UK
I thought this was in lieu of the 2020 Panto Season
Jackie Weaver looks like a councillor too tbh
I have 3 questions.  Did the meeting actually start?  Did they actually do anything?  Did they claim expenses?
4:19 Jackie: *GASP*
The UK to a tee. Ran by rooms full of self important pseudo-intellectual windbags who love the sounds of their own voices.
She's kicked Barry out ...🤣🤣🤣🤣
John Smith is like Martin Bryce from Ever Decreasing Circles. I bet he's got a clipboard.
eii this is funny as heck 🤣
What a bunch of bullies. Our Teams meetings are never like this.
I'm so confused, who is the chairman?
"You have no power here!"
This is seriously the best thing since Tiger King! They should of left them in the meeting! Haven't laughed so much in my life 😅🤣😅🤣
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE JACKIE WEAVER. Jackie Weaver: boots the chair and vice chair out the meeting 😂  Go on Jackie you legend!! Jackie gives 0 sh*ts 😂😂 👏🏻
Defo feel some tension between sue and cynthia
Wow the anger of some omg wow made my day  glad they got kicked out of the meeting
This how the Communists take over in 2021! The Commissar (Jackie Weaver) just ejects everybody she doesn’t like! Hilarious!
jackie weaver pulled a marie kondo, the chairman sparked no joy so she tossed him to the pit
I don't trust that John Smith bloke. For one thing, he's not called Clark. I'd trust him more if he was called Clark Smith. Or even John Clarke. He also seems like he's been plotting this putsch for a long time. We all know the type.
Love how they switch from their telephone voices to their normal real  life voices. Eg if I can interject here, I would be loathe,
Tories...bin them
This is just fantastic!
Yawn
"I'm going to subpoena E V E R Y B O D Y  !!!"
Wtf is Handworth?
This makes Hot Fuzz look like a documentary
"It's Jackie Weaver Bitch" - Michael Scott.
Can't stand each other in the same building. Can't stand each other at a distance. Can't stand because of old knees and hips.  It's odd because it's these elders that keeps the UK at a stand still, yet they can't even take a stand.
Good laugh that 🤣😂
Sue: "Second Tuesday in January, don't know what the date is... I haven't got my diary in front of me, sorry." Sue's computer: "Am I joke to you?" 17:37
Let's be honest: Everyone viewing this is from the UK
If they're like this on Zoom - what are they like when they meet in person ? (notice how all the blokes gang up on Jackie Weaver)
Anyone else feel like this would be great material for Inside Number Nine? Hehehe.
This is absolute gold
“Welcome to Handforth”
Who's Monica?
They’ll call this “The Coup on Caldy Road” 😂
YOU'RE ON MUTE!
5:48 Gollum time
I think one of the key issues here is a man shouting down a woman.
This is like the bingo Of everything that can go wrong on a zoom call 😂
The petty bureaucracy and arguments are hilarious. I'm British and I've grown up around this sort of stuff all my life.
I am glad this is  #1 trending lol
Vicar of Dibley on meth
Jackie Weaver for PM
I can see why some got exasperated by Jackie Weaver. She says confusing things. She keeps mentioning 'Monica on the screen,' for example: there is no Monica on the screen. She objects to someone calling themselves 'Clark'. There are millions of people called Clark. I think Jackie Weaver needs to take a long hard look at herself.
Clearly heavily edited for entertainment value. 😉
No wonder our roads dont get bloody fixed
reminds me of a late Pinter play
It's real life Hot Fuzz.....Handforth PC killing off all those who oppose them!
5:50 Did he suddenly become possessed?
"We don't want a turf war breaking out."  John Smith, acting (illegal) Chairman, Handforth Parish Council, Thur 10th Dec 2020.
"fuck off" at the beginning is the funniest bit
"Can we be assured that we won't be thrown out of the meeting like we were last time?"  You mean this happened before?! Handforth y'all are wild.
Jackie Weaver sounds like a real PITA. A real Hyacinth Bucket!
If nothing else comes out of 2021, this is enough😂
What was Aled all about? Manic, aggressive and the Golem voice....quite scary in a way. 'Yeeeees, council-master....! '
why are these old white men bullying her
#BritneySpears aka #JackieWeaver Ooops I did it again!
So this is how we lost the empire
She/he who controls the Zoom controls the world.
Most people have a useful role in life. Committee meetings were created for the few who don't.
chairman of the meeting. Gone to soon
It's like a bloody parody!! 😂
We all know a Jackie.....
The hate towards Birkenhead though
I wonder which way these men voted on Brexit?
Jackie Weaver moves her mouth like one of those claymation characters in Wallace and Gromit episodes.
The funny bits really start when Jackie starts kicking the shouty blokes out. They weren't funny, they were rude, sexist, and frankly if Jackie were in a room with them I'd be worried for her physical safety. Good for her, but I can see why she's glad its a Zoom meeting. The misogyny isn't just present, it jumps right out of the Zoom screen and stabs you in the eye with a toasting fork.
😂😂 the funniest thing I've seen in ages. Also shocking behaviour from some of the men!!!! 🤦‍♀️
What a comical excruciating waste of tax payers money
Aled's I pad absolutely slatting Birkenhead!
Not trying to be ageist but the man arguing with Jackie Weaver is at least 97 years old. Enjoy your retirement man Jesus Christ
And this is the reason nothing ever gets agreed at parish council meetings. This behaviour is appalling.
Jackie weaver is like a nazi sjw
The chairman of the council is the chairman of the council.
Almost million views in one day, amazing. I think should sign up for council, looks like a hell of  a fun
This is gold
18 minutes and 9 seconds of my life that I do not consider wasted. Thank you.
Old entitled white men being so rude. Everything that's wrong with local politics.
Ronnie Pickering: "Read the standing orders !"
And this people is the shite that runs our local councils.Gammons out of control. Jackie has the mighty power of REMOVE from meeting.Job done.
Where the hell my chairman gone 😁
Read the standing orders. *READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM*
Alan Murdoch is the most underrated character here. At the 11:25 mark, Jackie Weaver asks the question we're ALL asking as viewers: ''Who IS Alan Murdoch, please?''. It increases the anticipation tenfold before the moment of his big reveal.   And it doesn't disappoint. Alan seems a good-humoured and jovial man, resulting in a MAJOR shift in tone. Also, his dalliance with Sue is quite arousing.
When do we plan to start?  F**k off...  I knew this was going to be good lol
I think it is in the public interest for the Standing Orders to be published so we can become more informed as to the situation.
That's the fifteenth Beatle there with the guitars on his wall. John kicked him out for repeated pedantry over misplaced apostrophes in song lyrics. He's never gotten over it.
How did Ronnie Pickering get elected to Vice Chair ?? https://youtu.be/lgGmYeAm0jk?t=257
Thank you for the comments section.
Is it me but some reason i cant help thinking of the Chuckle Bros 'to you, to me'.
Horrible sad men. They're like a bunch of kids.
Quite rightly 😳
Spice Girls - Girl Power :D
Would you want this shower representing YOUR town??!!! 🤣😂🤣
'When do we plan to start?' 'fuck off'
what the fuc am i watching lol
10 seconds in - EF OFF immediately heard. Excellent start to a meeting
"The chairman of the council is the chairman of the, err, council." Underrated line in my opinion.
Peter Moore seems to have some history with the chairman. I hope we can one day recover the lost footage of the previous meeting so we can see these two titans clashing.
This is the most beautifully english gammon shit I've ever seen
I hope these chaps are ashamed of themselves. One or two clearly need anger management.
11:08 Roger Small is so small we can't even see him sitting on the chair.
This gives me strong Vicar of Dibley vibes.....is this the actual Vicar of Dibley reboot?
Girl someone said Fuck Off two seconds in and I knew it was going in
I haven't laughed so much in ages. It's like something from 'The vicar of Dibley'.
Absolute prime example why nothing gets done in a common sense, practical manner. Instead you have a bunch that have f'all better to do arguing and trying to score points on each other. Only time they can agree is when they want to name streets or 'white elephant' building schemes after themselves.
Jackie your patience is legendary
The “fuck off” under their breath at 0:10 is underrated.
I'm not sure which is more telling, the fact these men have so much time on their hands they can get angry about a parish council meeting or the fact I can't stop watching this! Ha ha
This is such a disgraceful attempt of a meeting!! Is this what goes on at 10 DOWNING ST!! GOD HELP THE BRITS.
They say at the end it might go viral..1 million views and world wide news reports later lol.
Don’t tell them you’re name Pike
3:18
I have been a parish councillor and I have never seen such an appalling display of incompetence in relation to the standing orders.  What?? I'm free to Clerk for you a few hours a week remotely if anyone from Handforth parish council is watching.
6:21 aled with the birkenhead disrespect 😂😂 coming from you HAHHA
This coup was perfectly executed by Jackie, first she eliminates the Chairman, Councillor Burkhill and even the Vice Chair. Then she installs the weak puppet chairman of John Smith.  All hail Jackie Weaver, the power behind the throne of the Handforth Parish Council
"Who is Alan Murdoch please?"  "Yes please."
Jackie Weaver is an absolute boss amongst a mainly white group of middle aged entitled men 😂
You could spin this idea into a sitcom quite easily.
That whisperscream at 5:50 is absolutely excellent. Textbook tantrum.
I work for a local council in London and have never seen anything like this, wtf is the back story to all the drama at the beginning?
im a scouser does anyone else think it would boss if this was a scouse version i do
The chairman of the council is eerrrrrrrr theeee errrr the chairman of the errrrrrNfJFBEbsb councill
This is comedy gold please do more 😂😂😂
16:11 You are now #1 trending David Pincombe. 🤣
Lol the member of public with hand in front of the camera... Hahaha.. And John Smith just tells him to put it down. LOL
Is this even real
This is unbearable.
‘Can we make this recording available..’  Makes recording available to the world.
What's even about 😂😂
Welcome to Royston Vasey
What are you talking about ... you don’t know what you’re talking about
Just shows these minor councils are full  of jumped up arseholes pretending to be major parliamentarians
Its like a cross between The Thick of It and The League of Gentlemen!!!
5:57 did Gollum turn up 😂
Partridgesque - superlative!!!
Jackie weaver really said uno reverse🤚💃
Who said fuck off when he said let’s start the meeting
mrs weaver PLEASEE this is not a proper meeting its not been accorded to the law. what does this even mean does this mean i dont have to go to school meetings because they’re unenforceable by law?!!?? mad
Sue is my spirit animal!
To be fair, I wouldn't normally stick up for the white men, but jackie is totally in the wrong through the whole meeting hahahaha this is just brilliant
"Read the standing orders. Read them and understand them" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You don't know how tempted i am to email the so called  chairman. What a prick. Ashley Comiskey Dawson
I literally have NO idea what's going on but im creasing up
How dare Jackie Weaver remove the Chairman!!!!?!!!?????!!
THIS IS A LOCAL TOWN FOR *LOCAL* PEOPLE
Perhaps Bradley Walsh can star as the chair John Smith in the film?
This is truly the best thing I’ve seen in a year
2020 lockdown must-see entertainment: Tiger King 2021 lockdown must-see entertainment: Handforth Parish Council
my country at its most hilarious 😂
It's like one of those things Rutger Hauer's character says he has seen at the end of Blade Runner.  “I’ve seen things you people wouldn’t believe, Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.  The Handforth parish council committee, I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate.  All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time... to...die.”
Glad to see local government is alive and kicking it the county I was born and raised.
Jackie weaver is going to become the new Carole baskin isn’t she?
Is this real 😂 I can’t believe it 😂best thing Iv watched this year 😂😂
No wonder they haven't got a fuckin clerk is it hahahaha i'm dyin
David: "if this goes viral, it will start a war of words"  Everyone: *please continue to share*
He was kicked out of the last meeting too! Content, NOW.
this is hilarious 🤣🤣 what bullies them 3 were
Almost as good as Monty Python!
All of a sudden Brexit makes sense.
Would hate to think what goes on when Jackie bumps into chair outside the local co-op
Jackie needs to be tamed
So thisssssss is where my council tax goes 🤦🏻‍♀️
Come on who is going to be the hero and remix this!
The Producers of Tiger King should look at this
I’de be pissing myself in the back ground
Jackie Weaver: “I am... inevitable”  *snap*
5:48 - When Jackie's pissed you off so much you turn into Golem.
That town is so 'Hot Fuzz'.
Absolute gold. Everything perfect, the names, the pompousness, the hopeless use of technology, the lack of self-awareness, the parochialism and petty bureaucracy. Good old England!
ahahahaha
He's not the clerk of Handforth Parish Council, he's a very naughty boy.
Bonum commune communitatis
it's like an episode of designated survivor.
It's worth asking yourself, if the country weren't in lockdown due to Covid-19 and the meeting had been held in situ with everyone in physical attendance, would Jackie Weaver have been able to commandeer the meeting and banish the chair and vice chair?  How exactly would she have performed that trick- brought her own security force and ordered the officials carted from the hall?  Some, it seems, are more equal than others.  And one "facilitator" is more equal than all.
"Read them and understand them!!" This is just so British. Self-important, petty arguments about process and positions rather than addressing any matter of substance. Clearly some of the members want to serve their community but for others this is just an ego trip. It is very like many of the committee meetings I have attended over the years. The Vicar of Dibley doesn't get a look in.
this is the future of reality TV post-covid lol 10:52
Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um... Um...Um... Um... Um... Um.. Um...Um...Um... Um... Um...

Where’s the Alderman is all this.
We pay these morons.
I used to live in Cheshire East. There are dark and mysterious forces at play there. But now a champion has arisen, a champion to save us all: behold Jackie Weaver!
Is this just an example of how men override women consistently 🤔
"One councillor has not attended a meeting for 6 months. The fact that there were no meetings is irrelevant"
The most interesting part of this 18 minute video are the opening minutes. Everything else is like any other zoom meeting
A turf war! 🤣🤣🤣
Bossy woman
Is this for real or a Little Britain skit?
That's brilliant!
16:12 We all just gonna ignore the fact this guy is clairvoyant?
Jackie got a bit power hungry
When is the next instalment, I can’t wait!
omggg its #1 on trending 💀💀
John Smith is loving it
Intrigue. Deceit. Attempted coups. "The greater good..."
5:49 gollum joins the committee
The early interjection of Julie's iPad is brilliant
When's the next next meeting?
Jackie Weaver - The new internet Karen. She sounds like a right little jumped up dictator.
Anyone that thinks the government are in the middle of some mastermind conspiracy to control people should watch this and see what the government officers are actually like. They couldn’t mastermind their way into a can of beans
Peter Moore my king
I can’t take this. Everyone is doing too much 😩😂😂😂😂🤣
Takes me back to my first year in England 1977. Typical English and I am really enjoying it.  What a breath of fresh air since covid 19. Did I hear flushing of the toilet ?
Just another reason why fuck all gets done in this backwards country..
Local democracy at its finest.
"You're muted Ian" 😂😂😂😂
Why does this kind of make me think of teachers if they spoke to everyone the way they speak to students
3:58...you’re welcome!
@13.30 mins .. omg .. wtf
A turf war lol this is great stuff.
Is this it? Really? I was told to look for the fuller video cos all the news sites only showed a couple minutes, I was expecting more from all the hype around this.
But what has the Handforth Parish Council ever done for us?
I'm sat watching this like a... like a... laughing hyena...😂
The one thing they actually decided on in the whole meeting: we can't let this recording go viral
My favourite thing is the way John Smith eventually decides to stop laughing and somehow gets elected replacement chair.
This council meeting is more productive than an episode of Question Time.
Prime time TV 📺
John Smith is so John Smith!

This has more bitterness and despair than the Downfall meme.
THIS IS PEAK ZOOM RIGHT HERE LMAOOOO
And now we know why local councils don't get much done.   Little people playing politics and jostling for power instead of working together for the good of their community.
alan murdoch has my heart
I heard the UN Security Council are currently drafting a response to the attempted coup.
Amazing. So much going on at once. It’s like Inception!
euthanasia would be doing a favor to boomers at this point. . . smh. . .
This just re-enforces the Vicar Of Dibley stereotypes of Parish Councils...puffed up individuals full of their own self importance
Who do you think said "fuck off" at the start?
So... Who has authority? Is Jackie from a separate council? Who was Julie talking to? So many questions.
The testosterone in this meeting stinks
At the very start one guy just starts by saying fuck off lol
How on earth is this not scripted? It's so perfect
Frantic googling of the difference between a "clerk" and "proper officer"...
I fucking die when it cuts to Barry Burkhill and he's just not saying anything and is turned the other way
If this is just the Planning and Environment Committee what is a full council meeting like ? Armageddon !
There's people in Myanmar watching this, thinking that our political coups are much more exciting than theirs
The vice chair deffo beats his wife angry  little pipsweak, big 45 years of age old doing a meeting with his dad holding his hand
Should be ashamed of themselves
This needs to be a show. Please netflix make this a real thing i love old people arguing
Jackies talking nonsense
John Smith is the man 😂😂😂 I felt that Laugh hard hahaha
David - ‘if this goes viral on the internet or Facebook then it would cause a war of words’   John - ‘can we make this recording available’   Just perfection 🤣
I have a feeling this would be golden if it was in Scotland 🤣
I cant be the only one that heard the subtle "fuck off" at 0:11
What a bunch of Muppets. 😆😆😆
One million views COME ON PEOPLE
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What a bunch of egotistical power crazy people
Gollum seems to join the call at 5:50
I love this so much
This is absolute gold !
oh what a tangled web we weave Jackie
This .. this .. omg .. this is so bloody English))
This video eradicated Coronavirus from the planet
Have the Police seen this, and have they investigated wihether any laws were broken, as claimed?
These are not paid staff, right?
Can someone please Autotune this meeting?
Handforth Massive 2 ....A turf war looms ....cricket bats & crocquet mallets at the ready.
Alright Cyn calm down
Why would anyone want to be on a council..... Oh yes, their huge ego.
Sue: Would it be acceptable to send a message to them,  to say if they are prepared  to come back and behave in the proper manner, then we would happily have them back in the meeting?  Cyn: No
If my council won’t start having this kind of meeting I won’t attend anymore!
big up handforth🤣
*Alans Ipad has entered the chat*
"Julie's I pad" is the real hero of this story
Jackie Weaver is brilliant in this. Calm with a slight sense of humour.
John's laugh at 5:04 is keeping me going.
Unbelievable! But oh soooo British. Can't wait for the next episode.
There just had to be a John Smith didn't there?
Jackie is a fucking boss.
Jackie didn’t pass the vibe check
Its only a birthday there organising
It'd make a great sitcom...no need for actors :)
Chairman: I am the Clark Council: Not yet Chairman: It’s treason then
I watched 4 times now 🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♂️ never liked a meeting as much as this one 😁🤗 when is the next meeting coming out?
Julie's sighs are brilliant
Jeez these men do not know how to behave and speak to people. This is insane!
Petition to have the strongly worded letter from the Monitoring Officer released into the public domain
Do the people who are objecting have a point and is there a legal aspect to the behaviours and how this is conducted?
I want to meet jackie she's hilarious 🤣🤣
ReAd ThEm aNd UnDerSTAAAAaANd them
What a shambles . They must be all so embarrassed
This is definetely going to be in the next British meme compilation
Ring i like
Sadly this is typical of many local council meetings. Clearly the power no longer lies with the elected representatives but the person who has physical control of the zoom control panel ie the 'mute' button.
My god how I love this
Did Armando Iannucci write this? 😂
Boomers
YESSSS CMONNNN BOYSSSSSSSSSS IM SO GASSED FOR THIS
Give them all a TV series. This is the greatest thing I've ever seen!
Does someone go a bit Exorcist about 1/3 of the way through?! Brilliant people. Jackie for PM.
I think he was thrown out of the meeting
Little England at its worst. (also what do these people even do)?
There has got to be a TV Series in this, it will probably include a Murder or several
Usual busy bodies doing what they do. Probably neighbours from hell, probably all vote conservative, fuck giving them so much air time .
"When do we plan to start?" "Fuck off" "I think we could start any moment chairman"
Ffs Jackie
i love this
This is brilliant I want to visit handsforth when we are allowed 🤣
I can't help but loving the passive-aggresiveness of the Brits. I was drinking water, it turned into tea.
1 million views in it's first day....
"Who _is_ Alan Murdock?"  "Yes please!"
You know shits about to go down when within 10 seconds somebody says ‘fxck off’ under their breath at a parish council meeting
This could be a little Britain sketch, lots of talking about talk, arguing about arguments. Nothing actually said. It's classic. But Jackie Weaver... is some cow.
Whilst this is funny to watch, the attitude of the two guys who got kicked out was disgusting. First class bullying - yeah way to go!
So much diversity in that panel ay
Why do I suddenly feel so proud to be British? This is pure gold, way better than Dad's Army. Much more professional that the Trump Show was on USA TV
#1 on trending!
so the chairman declares himself as a clerk then gets annoyed when no one referred to him as such
Aled's ipad (vice chair) turned into Gollum before storming off..."We're trying to do a Teams call you fool...Where's my PRECIOUS!!!!!"
Jackie weaver deserves a medal for putting up with this

This is incredible. Silly old pricks like this in charge of everything everywhere.   Jackie - you’re a bloody star!
What a bunch of horrible idiots. Ugh.
I just can't wait for Episode 2!! 🤞
Was there a fcku off right at the beginning after "when do we plan to start"?

I wonder why Alan’s iPad got booted initially 😂 I didn’t see him being disruptive   Aled’s iPad on the other hand oh my god is that gollum
This is better than an episode of "The Thick of It" 😂
"Who's Alan Murdoch?". "Yes". Pure good
All I'm seeing here is a great idea for Hot Fuzz part 2....😆
Put your hand down Roger!!! What did they achieve in this meeting???! 🇬🇧👊
Jackie Weaver looks like the cartoon judge out of Pink Floyd's the Wall
I need a sitcom based on the antics of Jackie Weaver
There should make a TV series with calls like this titled "Zoomer Boomers"
Jackie is in charge
I am working from home. Not tied to any office. I want to move to Handforth!!!

"Put yer hand down Peter"
A turf war in the 'hood ... Bloods v Cripps all over again!
“Excuse me. Are you the Judean People's Front?” “Fuck off!”
This just goes to show how white older men think they’re above all.... The behaviour displayed, should it have been a woman, she would have been branded as hysterical, emotionally unstable, unfit for the role and any other such descriptive words that men like to use towards women. Totally disgraceful.
Well, nice to see them all behaving so maturely and tax payer's money well spent on this crowd!! 😂😂😂
You can't remove the chairman!  Jackie: hold my 🍺
APPALING BEHAVIOUR
Someone please leak the zoom link for febs meeting x
Jackie weaver,queen of the Coup d'état.
Funny, funny!!
This should be made into a sitcom
"Shall we make the recording of the zoom meeting available?"  The internet thanks you, Councillor
I'm in hysterics 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I was just like "YESSSS KICK THEM OUT JACKIE!!!" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"The chairmen of the Council is the... er.... chairmen of the ..er.... council"  We are in the presence of a ferocious intellect here. Fantastically executed point well made.
How do I join. Looks great fun
Will this be released as a box set?
So much beige! Just glorious!!
everything about this is so iconic i’m crying with laughter
7:11 mystery toilet flush!! 10:17 <Sue> 14:31 Sue interjects part 2  I also think the way Roger Small's swivel the first few seconds is underrated and comedic genius
A hate to say this but is 5his what happens when a woman doesn't get her own way or knows the rules.
sahakjshakaksggs you fool  ...   AHAHAHAHA
😂😂 It's what 'The Vicar of Dibley' would have been like if it was still made today and had a Zoom Meeting sketch
David knew what he was doing
For crying out loud, Jackie, read the standing orders. Read them!!
5:49 Gollum 😂😂😂😂
What is wrong with these people?! If they can't muster some basic decency while representing the general public then they deserve to be kicked out of the meeting.
Tf is this
* has a meeting on zoom * “WE’RE TRYING TO HAVE A TEAMS MEETING YOU FOOL”
In my opinion, more than one person here is actually an Improper Officer...  (watching from Malta, funniest thing I’ve seen in ages! This is so very British)
How has this got number 1 on trending i will never know. Im not sure if this is a secret coup against the chairman by jackie weaver or is it a dictatorship by the vice chair. We may never know
The way he staged a coup and declared himself clerk
The boomer has done all it has with clear conscience, they knew they were crippling their own progeny. The system died in 2001 - 20 years ago. The boomer knows this but in the boomers narcissistic hubris it's a good thing as the boomer gets to die on top, "the last of the real men" John Wayne in their own imaginations. The "Me Generation" believes castrating their own male children via Cronos esque child consuming behaviors, was a stroke of brilliance as now their sons could never surpass them, to the boomers such a thing is "emasculating". The boomer destroyed their sons & grandsons, and at 65 will saunter into Hooters and disgustingly "flirt" with 19 year old waitresses. Even in their geriatric years they view young men as sexual compition. The utterly depraved creatures make me sick.  TLDR; Boomers couldn't live up to their fathers, so they made sure their sons couldn't live up to them
MRS WEAVER PLEASE!!!!
vice chair thinks he's a copper
All of these people are absolutely awful.
i love watching old people try and zoom because they have no idea how to mute themselves
US: Karen UK: Cyn
Why is this #1 on trending?
Epic
One of them goes all Gollum
Bye Barry, bye Gollum, bye Aled, you're too 'precious'. Tossers!
This video sums up 2020.
We rockin with Jackie weaver ⁉️⁉️
Proper British humour!! 🤣
This will definitely turn into a sketch one day!!!! Pure class 😂
The terf wars begin!
😂
Ya know when John Smith said 'June' at 15.41 I really thought we were getting a new character
Who is it who says fuck off ? 😂😂😂
How many Tories...?
I am the bloody clerk!
Tag yourselves based on your fight personality, I'm John Smith
We're trying to have a Teams meeting you fool! is my new go to at work
When's the next episode? Is this series on Netflix?
"The Chairman of the Council is................. the Chairman of the Council!!" LOL
This needs a Netflix adaptation - this could be the next Tiger King!
Have i just turned on Inside No.9 by mistake?
I was on the edge of my seat when Smeagol joined at 5:47
Absolute appalling behaviour by most if the men in the meeting. No respect at all.  Typical of local and parochial meetings where jumped up people believe they have more power than they really have. Good on you JW for standing up for yourself
‘I love democracy’ -Jackie Weaver
I want to be Jackie Weaver for Halloween.  She is my new super hero.
Did anyone hear a toilet flush at 7.13?
The reason old people should be banned from any key positions unless they pass IQ and tech tests.
Jackie Weaver aka Britney Spears 🤣
And these are the people who are making local decisions.
Kinda sad that this went viral. Bunch of old council members getting nothing done, plus throwing in tech that they barely know how to use xP
"If this goes viral on the internet, its going to start a war of words" John Smith: "I agree, we dont want to prejudice......we dont want to start a turf war"  The absolute compton style scenes as Handsforth descends into chaos, drive-bys, firefights, militia deployment groups, gang signs representing ur territory, Thanks alot Jackie
“We haven’t started the meeting yet, do you want to speak anyway?”  I’m fucking dying  #TeamJackieWeaver
Julie calling her iPad an I pad is the most triggering thing on this video
These are the people who complain to the council when there is a tree growing too far near a pavement of if a neighbours dog is barking in the garden
I love a plot twist I thought Jackie Weaver was going to be the weird star of the show then she actually became the narrator of the farce
Another sexist man eating his own words. I guess Jackie has the authority after all, jackwagon.
5:42
john and jackie are legends
I thought Reece Shearsmith was brilliant as Aled's angry little mate
we put the disruptive members in a waiting room 🤣 The zoom version of a naughty step
Repent to Jesus Christ!  Saint Luke 5:32 KJV I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.   Saint Luke 13:3 KJV I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
This is the video we all needed
Tories at their finest!
These people probably have over 1,000 years worth of Bingo hours between them...
You've seen all the best of the demented chaos in the first 3 mins. The rest is largely incoherent but cheerful banter. Still have no idea what the meeting was trying to achieve. Anyone else have a clue?
Jackie was certainly wearing her ovaries on the outside that evening.
When Emperor palpatine gets demoted on zoom
god i hate this country
5:49 wtf hahahaahah
If the sun was to report this:  JACKIE WEAVER STAGES COUP IN THREAT TO DEMOCRACY
not on jackie weaver. not on at all!
I want a subcommittee of the steering group t shirt
Plot twist David leaked it and it became viral 🤣😂
Are you the proper officer?
I had no idea Golem lived in Handforth..
I don't even understand what they're trying to do... They're getting so caught up in red tape they don't even get on with anything 😭 typical government at any level.  Pathetic bullying though by those guys, glad they're on the internet in all their glory
Glorious!
That Gollum impression was top
Disappointed we lost “READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM” guy so early on. He had all the best lines.
Disappointed we lost “READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM” guy so early on. He had all the best lines.
Talk about everyone throwing their toys out of the Pham
Tempted to sell badges "I'm the clerk of Handforth Parish council". Maybe t shirts too
Britney Spears' meeting goes Toxic
Super Karen to the rescue!
Not as good as the first two series of League Of Gentlemen..
These people make decisions on a council level. It's fucking hilarious and terrifying at the same time.
WELCOME TO HANDFORTH
Birkenhead got violated 😭
The Gollum part is quite frankly arse splittingly hilarious.
When the council chairman thinks he is talking to Jackie Weaver the Grey...  But he is actually talking to Jackie Weaver the White
So much cringe.
People are so obsessed with made up rules that they forgot how to be decent human beings who can converse respectfully to each other. I thought this was a Parish?
Welcome to Brexit Britain.  I think Jackie Weaver did a great job. Where was Nigel Farage in this madness?
*Proceeds to go viral and break the internet
One of best animes I've ever watched
Bizarre and, sadly, rather pathetic!
Is Julian Assange behind the leak?
"You have no authority here jackie weaver" Jackie: "I'm the meeting host" *bans him*
"You have no power here"
Jackie and Cyn istg
No, no, no, no em yes.
I TAKE CHARGE
LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE
I knew I had discovered a diamond in the rut when I heard.  “Can we be assured we won’t be thrown out the meeting like last time”
What a great start to the weekend! Absolutely brilliant!
"coming from you from Birkenhead" 😂😂😂 That is one petty man
This is what a Haribo themed zoom meeting would look like
“When do we plan to start?”  *sigh*  F            U            C           K             O      F      F
Is that (looks at script).....ideal.
"The chairman will decide your fate" "I *AM* the chairman"
All I can say is what a lot of ignorant and arrogant people there are on that council.  I pity the poor people who live in that council area and can now see what a load of nasty people they have elected.   Good on Jackie Weaver for keeping calm and being polite in the face of such abuse.
Julie's I Pad stole the show!
"It will be interesting for other parties of the council to hear it" and the rest of the country.
And this is why brexit happened
You're finally witnessing the absolute chaos of the north-west's elderly residents
the chairman is aggy from the start 🤣🤣🤣
Jackie weaver or emperor palpatine you decide   I am the senate
Been to many such meetings, believe me you leave wanting to blow your brains out. The procedure and processes based discussions are worse then pulling your teeth out.
The video is a metaphor for current events 🇺🇸
Its a laughing joke. 😂😂😂
She was only a clerk to the council but she let the borough surveyer....
We need this as a new reality show, this is proper entertainment
Who is the best Weaver?  Jackie Vs Sigourney
I like the fact that they were holding one councillor in contempt for not attending meetings the last six months...even though there hadn’t been any meetings.
🤣👍"where's my tenalady a laugh a minute @Handforth___parish.....Lol ...👊#NAUGHTY_STEP_ME
is this a monty python sketch?
Councils need young people. No offense to these people but they will be dead in like 10-15 years. Young people understand what is needed
YOU’RE MUTED IAN
Better than an episode of The Vicar of Dibley 😂😂😂😂😂
Sue : a member of the public would like to speak John Smith : sorry? Sue : PETER WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK  She tried but she clearly said f*ck the standing orders here lol
More of these please. They are classics!
No fucks given by Jackie...
The chairman, explaining he'd been thrown out the last meeting, almost made sure he'd be ejected from this one.
Craziest thing about this video is that brits think the letter “e” in clerk makes an “ah” sound
This is hilarious they should put this lot in the House of Lords , at least the Lords would be kept awake with the laughter , they are worth the money for the entertainment value alone !!!
This is better than a comedy programme.  I hope these people aren't paid out of Council Tax.....Go Jackie Weaver !!
I have no idea who is the chairman and deputy chair of this lot, but the simple rule should be that only the chairman or his/her deputy can call a zoom or (as this was) a teams meeting. Clearly Jackie Weaver set the meeting up because she had control of it. Also the chairman should mute all the mics until someone wants to talk.  If the chairman and deputy chairman are really in that position, this is a totally unconstitutional  meeting, simple as that.  Honestly, what a rabble. I am slightly curious to know who is in the right here. If Jacky and mates are not (*edit: the relevant) elected officers they should be removed from the committee for misconduct.
the handforth pc clerk guy sounds like winnie the pooh but with a british accent
I hope nobody in Handforth was waiting for a decision on their planning application😂!!
This is without a doubt the funniest thing I’ve ever seen
I don't even know why I am watching or even what I am looking at, but that is so entertaining!!!!
Never want to be in a meeting as much as this 🤣🤣🤣 brilliant 👏 👌 🙂
This is the most British representation of a zoom meeting
"in 25 years i havent seen anything like this" sounds like an english substitute teacher
Respect to sue, she’s a very mature and charming woman.
Gollum enters the chat at 5:48
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE
Pissed myself watching this.One councillor needs to grow up and grow a pair🤪😱
Britain is such a funny little place
You have no power here, Jackie Weaver "It's treason then"
This is Gold....
This reminds me of my grandparents why are old people so petty? 😂
When’s episode 2 available “ Revenge of the Chairman “ 😂😂
I live in Handforth. What a bloody embarrassment.
These are the types of people that run your local authority all over the country. Muppets all of them. God help us. Making decisions about your lives.
"I take chahge!" "READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!"
Please refer to me as Brittany spears from now on
Cyn the underdog for PM
"Who's Alan Murdoch" that's a steal from Rigsby's line in 'Rising Damp' "Who's Tommy Lawton!" Fecking Genius.
Jackie Weaver is 2021's Carole Baskin
Mute button lol
fuck me, no wonder why shit doesn't get sorted, fucking hell
Now I completely understand why people enter politics. It's by far the easiest way for mental midgets to stroke their fragile egos with delusions of power and authority, without them needing to possess any of the skills required to be useful in the actual real world.
why is this uploaded in 240p>
Gollem has left the building
I LOVE THE DRAMA MICK! I JUST LOVE IT
Alan’s ipad 🤣
I thought Wincanton town council was bad, But even 5 councillors resigning stating differences with the chair, didn’t go viral. It all goes on at council meetings 😂
10 seconds in and the "fuck off" has me dying
So League of Gentlemen! ha ha ha
5:48 I love the bit where Gollum makes an appearance
Oh fuck this will be on Big Fat Quiz Of The Year in December 🤣🤣🤣
All we need is someone playing porn in the background and it would be perfect!
Ok I’ve done some research and Handforth is a small town/village in the north of England near Manchester Airport, and has a population of 6 thousand.
Thought I was watching Vicar of Dibley for moment 😂😂😂
What is happening at minute 6? 😂😂😂 Is that imitation of Gollum on purpose?
Like an episode of Vicsr of Dibley where the characters try to grapple with technology. Who said older people are wiser? Not sure why anyone at Hanworth Parish would want such farcical incompetence being shown to millions!
Jackie weaver is a whole mood
This is comedy gold
Brilliant stuff! The best of British
this is brilliant 😂😂😂 thank you for making me smile today I hope you all see the humour here aswell, british comedy gold lol
Small towners pretending that what they're going is of life and death importance
This is so boomer.
These are the people we are giving up our lives to protect 🤣 we must get them the vaccine so they can meet in person, documented for TV of course
Who the FUCK is the chairman? I still don’t know and it’s frustrating me
Council Members get real ratty when someone is sent in to sort them out, guess they're used to being a big fish in a little pond.
Who says you need a big budget to make great films. I'll be more than happy to watch this for 2 hours 😂
Imagine if an employee called a meeting on behalf of a board of directors then kicked the CEO off despite constantly interrupting and womansplaining, implemented a different set of policies and procedures on behalf of him and elected a new chairman. How very democratic 😂 That's what makes it so funny.
This is British comedy gold! I’m just thinking of the poor wives of most of these male councillors - what horrible people! Peter’s cool tho! 😆
'You have no authority here Jackie' had strong Sauruman vibes.   'You have no power here... Jackie Weaver'.
John Bercow eat your heart out
For a second I thought Molly Sugden (Jackie Weaver) came back to life.
Jackie weaver looks like an English teacher at school
old men shouting down, talking over and putting down women. :-(
"If you disrupt this meeting I will have to remove you from it" >"You can't"  How are these people even in office?! they're behaving like children.
soundtrack for Cold War Steve .............
"Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on" needs to be on a mug urgently. Also I'm a drama lecturer and this dialogue needs to be studied for pacing and interjections 🤣
This just sums up the worst of "Little England". A bunch of trumped-up, ageing, small-c conservatives with too much time on their hands dictating what is acceptable to everyone else. This kind of petty-minded, traffic warden mentality is evident right across British local government. "The Vicar of Dibley" has nothing on these people.
No idea what’s going on lol
Oscars 2021 Best Short Film Nominee
Did Gollum from lord of the rings turn up at 6.00
Everything wrong with the human condition and a slither of elected power within 20 minutes.
I would be lost for that to happen
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE
These are the type of people to post on local community Facebook pages warning about harmless teenagers looking like "they're up to no good".
Dear God the last thing we need is another turf war in Handforth!
Jackie for Chair !   👍
Proves that with age, doesn't come wisdom. Bunch of clowns, all need sacking off.
Good trading ground for a role in the EU Commission?
I can’t believe this real.
This is comedy gold 😂
I kinda feel sorry for Jackie Weaver
Call me Britney Spears from now on !!!!
Someone sign these people up for a TV series!
Sad, this could be Northern Ireland Counsels in a few years time, Egos Bigger Than a House!!!
“We don’t want a turf war breaking out” 😆 Enter music to West Side Story “when you’re a jet you’re a jet...”
"I'm glad it's a Zoom meeting". So are we Jackie, so are we.
5:48 Gollum joins the chat
It's just the tonic people needed right now. All the bad vibes are left on the clip and every response I've seen has been endearing and joyous. Disclaimer: eye rolling is the English way of saying "you're one of us now"!
Hot Fuzz didn't lie old people in small towns are crazy.
This would never happen if the attendees were Londoners.
When John Smith started laughing......!
G'won Jackie LOL
WILL YOU STOP TALKING
Don’t know how I got here but it’s awesome 🤣
This is perfect
3:16 ‘We can’t see Jackie Weaver’ says Barry Burkhill, not knowing where the zoom is coming from
'fuck off' muttered under breath at 0:11
this is why nothing gets done  ;o)
5:45 my god he became possessed 🤣🤣🤣
Someone needs to attach the Vicar Of Dibley intro to this
I no like Cyn! She is very cheeky lady!
Where can I find the previous meeting?????
I  knew something positive would come out of the lockdown
Thought I was looking at the UK government's Covid-19 strategy meeting.
beautiful
Jackie "I am the Senate" Weaver😂😂
this has definitely put Cheshire on the map
Roger Small Semicolon
Small town democracy in action. I WANNA BEEE, E ANARCHY
THIS IS TOO FUNNY SHE IS THE FEMALE VERSION OF SENATOR PALPATINE CROSSED WITH CAROLE BASKIN
"we don't want a turf war breaking out if this goes viral " these guys 😭😂😂😂😂😂😂
Royston Vasey anyone? All so terribly British
Keep in mind this is some piss-pot Parish council in a town of under 7,000. Just goes to show how drunk people can get on their "power"
"Ian your muted!"
This is absolutely sensational 😂😂😂. This needs be a series. Imagine the damage to ensue
Sounds like someone whispered "fuck off" before it even started!
If this is the pilot, when is EP 1? 🤣🤣🤣 Just class
British cinema at its finest!
Parish business is serious business in Cheshire East
This group couldn't organise a piss up in a brewery...reminds  me of The  Peoples front of Judea, Monty Python.
how can people well past there retirement age be running our councils and governments its absurd !! you respect no one else's views other then your own
David Pincombe
Need a LegalEagle law review
Parish councils are rife with old men throwing their weight around. Remove them and re-elect.
Oh man we need celebrity big brother back on get Jackie in the house 😂
It's not just gone to monitoring but also viral
Why does Gollum say “we’re trying to have a teams meeting”
Not as funny as Sandbach Town Council ...Steve crane having his dinner  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmj07q2yAk8
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE BRITNEY SPEARS
Clap for Jackie, 6pm tonight.
Jackie Weaver vs. Eric Cartman  Who has more authority?
Illegaly. Lol.
did we UM try to be UM civil here UM .....UM UM UM UM UM
Reminds me of Best in Show.
David Pincombe knew what was coming - he warned them all about this newfound fame
Cyn is like Jenny on Dragon's den, she's against everything.
"He hasn't attended a meeting for 6 months. The fact that no meetings were held is irrelevant" 😂😂
The impotent officious bluster of that lonely old man, behaving like Napoleon with what little authority has been afforded him is so tragic I'd almost feel bad if he wasn't such a dick.
Jobsworthy and Dads army comes to mind! 🤣
This is shocking!!
Aleds iPad going full on Gollum is just pure gold dust.
Completely lost it when Gollum took over for a minute or so at 5:48.
Jobsworth Dinosaurs
Just like Almondsbury Parish Council. Totally incompetent and shambolic! Taxpayers deserve better!! Next Local Authority Election, vote in UKIP candidates who are fiscally competent.
*Handforth PC Clerk* : It's only the chairman who can remove people from the meeting. You have no authority here, Jackie Weaver.  *Jackie Weaver* : Hold my beer.
Is Aled's mate Smeagol in disguise?
Jackie Weaver is “The One Karen”. The Mecha-Karen, the final boss of Karen’s.
bloated egos are insufferable
British Pensioners doing what they do best, 😂 showing our younger generation how to bully effectively and do bugger all but waffle with self importance. 🤣🤣🤣
Jackie weaver has some explaining to do
Pathetic.
This is by far the funniest thing I have watched since the start of lock down, outstanding performances all round! 😂😂😂
Growing old is compulsory, growing up remains optional.
This is the closest thing to ‘One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s’ the sequel - BAFTA shoe in..
Poor Jackie... she attended a problematic meeting as an impartial "referee" and found national fame! Her name will now be forever linked to an infamous parish council meeting.
The "f*** off" at 0:10 really set the tone haha
"It was a very good example of bullying in Chesire East... And the surrounding environs" is such a Partridge line
Can't wait for the video from the second Tuesday in January!
The neighbourhood plan steering group has never formally been disbanded...I need this on a T-shirt.
Typically British !! 😂👍😷🙄🇬🇧
This is the most boomer thing I’ve ever seen.
How did these people ever manage to conquer one third of the planet?
Thank you  a million times for this, nothing on tv, bit bored ,then found this...laughed til I cried.
If members of the public can join, I'm joining the next one
You laugh at Handforth PC Clerk, but it's people like him who stop tyrannical dictators from rising to power and committing genocide with his absolutely unwavering petulance and bizarre obsession with County law.
Yoooo, at 5:46 I am sure Gollum joins the zoom call.
🤣 🤣 🤣 Just stop it Jackie, u have no authority kicking ppl out, it's only the chairman who can. David's behaviour is absolutely disgusting. U fool 🤣 we trying to have a meeting 🤣 Jackie - byebye 🤣🤣🤣 This is class...Julies Ipad 😜
Jackie Weaver’s real Britney Spears moment was when she pulled an “Oops I Did It Again” and booted 3 different people from the zoom
Is that.... ideal?
Roger planned the greatest entrance in Handforth parish council meeting history, and they cut away at the crucial point, the real crime here.
Not as good you'd hope. Starts well then is dull.
and these people run our country haha and councils not fit to run on a treadmill literally ran by senile old people
Sums up UK Politics. Adults acting like children!
Not a fan of Cyn
Handforth council needs it's own tv channel.
This is the best anime I've seen in years! I still can't believe Handforth PC Clerk was killed off so quickly, truly an emotional scene. 10/10 would recommend.
Wait, the chairman didn't attend the meeting for six months, and the fact that they didn't have meetings for six months is irrelevant? WTF?
18mins later sat here trying to work out if the meeting actually happened...
Turf war!
What the fuck is going on
Nice close up of John Smith’s shirt and cardigan. Lovely weave
That was a good toilet fart at 7:12
This epitomises why women are not suited to politics. And why we see the decline in our liberties and freedom of speech.
This is my job, i am a deputy clerk for a parish council, and you hear these stories from other Clerks all the time with the bullying in our sector. Its terrible, however due to covid and our meetings being digital and online these things are finally being shown to the public how dreadful some people can be. The Clerk Jackie Weaver did certain things wrong, but at the end of the day, the Councillors were bullying, also for a Chairman to then self claim they are a Clerk is just wrong. A Clerk is an employee of the Local Government, and a Chairman/Councillor is an elected member of the public, regardless if you are a political or non political council, you just cannot tell yourself you are Clerk. There are so many things here going on but fingers crossed their council will improve...
18 minutes and I still haven't a clue what the meeting was about 😂
Did Jackie Weaver just stage a coup?
This is the single greatest piece of content ever produced by man.
Did they ever decide on what time the bake sale should start?
Love how I live close to where this occurred. The people in that meeting r a fair representation of folks round here😂
Gollum at about 5:45
Was the strongly worded letter ever sent
5:17 - 6:10 is the best bit I'm sorry, the gollum cameo is HILARIOUS and hilarious "we're trying to have a teams meeting you fool" *wicked cackle*
That's the most ums I've ever heard in 20 minutes.
Is it true Barry burkhill is still looking for sue
Boomers 🙄😂
What a bunch of wast of space people. Why are such old deluded people who clearly can't even get on with each other, having any Control of anything. You should all be ashamed. Retire now.
Justice for chairman Barry
Ricky Gervais could turn this into TV gold!
Ok Boomer(s)
J a c k i e  W E A V E R  😆😆😆😆
john smith is a snake, he laughs with burkhill then pretends that he's on jackie's side 😂
This video should be shown to convert people to anarchy
Imagine coming out of that call and then saying “well I think that went really well tbh”
Anyone have a copy of the minutes? Looks like all the minutes links are now dead.
17:00 "Can we make this recording of the Zoom meeting available?" was the kiss of death
Milhouse: "When are they gonna get to the standing orders?!" *cries*
Waiting room is the gulag
This has been the best comedy sketch i've seen for years. now sack the lot of them
It'l be made into a tv series - heard it here first
Have these people never heard of headphones? What a cacophonous mess.
Jackie doesn't understand the basic law. She is a criminal! She also doesn't know the order from the Bible! She needs God!
5:45 to 6:00 gollem is that you ?
The other man on Aled's Zoom account is Keith Edward William Brewerton by the way, if anyone is interested.
Gold
WE'RE TRYING TO WATCH YOUTUBE YOU *******FFFFOOOOOOOOOOLLLL*********
I'll check back tomorrow when this is rightfully the most viewed video on Youtube Mover over Despacito,  Jackie Weaver has entered the chat
For everyone outside of the UK, this is the most British thing you'll see since Monty Python.
JACKIE PICKERING
Jackie Weaver: Can people mute their mics to reduce background noise? Julie's I Pad: It's time for a revolution
There’s no way this isn’t a scripted comedy
That laugh at 5;25 is definitely the side effect of PFIZER vaccine
There is something so perfectly British about this
thank god for covid
JULIE'S IPAD
Gollum has a guest role in this comedy.
Off with his head! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They need to have a good old fashioned fist fight to settle this once and for all!
What an awful shambles.
The sound of the toilet flushing at one point was amazing,
When's the next race nite to raise funds for the leaking roof? I wanna go coz it'll be quality 😂
05:55 Gollum is even there!
THE GREATER GOOD
I didn't know I needed this
5min 50 sec..we re trying to have a teams meeting YOU FOOL
Karen “2020” - I owned it, no one will topple that”   Jackie “2021” - hold my parish book
Sums up perfectly "local politics" and why most people don't get involved, I spent countless hours witnessing debacles just like this, massive ego's, tiny intellects.....
"On balance, it would appear the disruptive councillors were wrong to say the extraordinary meeting was invalid.  And, on balance, the exact manner of their exclusions was not in accordance with the Standing Orders – though, in the circumstances, the disruptive councillors can hardly complain."
16:12  The prophecy has been fulfilled.
Handforth Parish Council announces next meeting.  Zoom collapses through demand.
4:48 - 5:02 -  guy turns in to Gollum from the Lord of the Rings. "My Precious Teams Meeting!"
It’s like a live action remake of any Facebook comments row
Jackie (aka Britney spears) has gone rogue 😂
"I think if this goes viral... it will start a war of words" Really? 😅 this is the best thing since Sanders and his mittens 😅😅😅
All UK Government is like this to some extent. Probably contributed to the size of the British Empire, as people streamed out of country to get away from governance like this.
The sexual tension between Allen and Sue is underrated.
One of them sounds like Gollum Lord of the Rings. "My Precious Meeting" ha ha
Guy at the start sounds like the Chernobyl fella. "How could I be responsible for this, I was sleeping"
I bet Ronnie Pickering is involved in this
Boomer reality show when?
I want to be on the sub committee of the steering group
who is the angry buffon on Aled's iPad?
Is this the funniest Zoom meeting ever?
Are sure this isn't a casting call for Lord of the Rings? 3:56 PC clerk thinks he's doing a riveting performance of King Theoden. Then Gollum shows up at 5:43 for an oscar winning performance!
“Please refer to me as Britney Spears”!! What a legend
The people of Handforth are paying for this!!!
Jackie Weaver kicks arse !........Carry on up the Council.......Sid James (RIP) eat your heart out......and Kenneth Williams of course......not to mention Barbara Windsor.....all RIP along with Handforth Parish Council.......sorely missed but never forgotten...
"READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM..."
JACKIE WEAVER.
The pointlessness of it all
This has really cheered me up 😆
Liam Fox is good as John Smith....
I’m sorry the last bit of this gose viral it’s gonna cause a war of words so good
This has single handedly saved 2021 🙌🏻🙌🏻 An here for when Ian comes in. With receipts too!
What are you talking about, you don't know what you're talking about.
Ahahaha
Carry on Hanford 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙂
Steven this is gold! Thanks for sharing, I shall be subscribing to your channel. Wish you the best
This is why NOTHING gets done in parish councils.. Truly, parishes are absolutely pointless, as this hillarious show proves..  Just a bunch of biggeted old gits on a power trip!  😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 This is totally REDICULOUS and completely typical.
Would make the Monty Python team throw away their jokebooks! How could they compete with this.
You literally couldn't script this, its absolute comedy gold!!
This is the funniest thing I have seen in ages. They should have their own tv show!
Can anyone confirm if Jackie has read the standing orders?
16:13 who is this man so powerful he predicted the future.
Alan’s Barnet is the best bit !
Jackie Weaver: * breathes * Vice Chair of Handforth PC: wait thats illegal
I love how they're acting like this is the most important meeting ever held
This is the most British thing I've ever seen!
Thanks for making my afternoon. This is too good. Can I join the next one?
5:49 lol someone call a priest. 😆
Wow, Aled's iPad seems like he has anger issues
Greatest thing I've seen since ever.
“No because the vice chairs here, and I take charge. READ THE STANDING ORDERS!!! READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM”   You can’t write this stuff. Thanks Handforth Parish Council for all of your belligerence and dysfunctionality. Made my day.  😂  #sheskickedoutbarryimleaving
Haven't laughed this much since Fawlty Towers. John Cleese would have loved this.
"You have no power here, Chairman the Grey" - Saruman / Jackie Weaver depending on who you ask.
5:45 Gollum entered the zoom, one zoom to rule them all
The guy who was saying he's the vice chairman descended into golem before he got removed 😂
this is a pure farce
"this meeting has been called illegally" It's a parish council meeting, not Parliament.
5:50
SUBPOENA SUBPOENA SUBPOENA SUBPOENA
9:40 “It’s Jackie, bitch.”
omg....*wipes eyes* then in comes Julie at 3:05
Parks and Recreation - UK Edition
5:40
Blimey someone said eff off at the start  ! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is about right. The old guys are like something from The Wheeltappers and Shunters Club. Self important arsholes. Hilarious.
when people love to have power over others - this is what they do. hahaha its just brilliant. No wonder nothing gets done at all
This is the most quintessentially English thing I've ever seen
'Parks and Recreation' UK-style...
Am confused
Can you imagine if this viral clip causes anyone of them to run for the House of Commons
Team "old guy who got kicked"
God I hate this world of online meetings xD
Is that a toilet flush at 07:12?!
(unintelligible tantrum noises)
MRS WEAVER, PLEASE!
Who was Aled calling a fool 🤔🙄. .. anger issues
Is this a new episode of Inside Number 9?
'Sub-committee of the steering group?' - his dismay is palpable.
Jackie Weaver - “I am the senate”
READ THE STANDING ORDERS
My Friday entertainment! Who needs Emmerdale when you have this?! Brilliant 🤣🤣🤣 #teamJackie
Karen Weaver
John Smith is like a knock off Bradley Walsh with glasses
Absolutely hilarious.
Hahahaha havnt laughed like this in a long long while!
They should make this into a weekly soap opera!
The comedic timing is impeccable
Who is alan murdock though really
Handforth is full of wannabe snobs who live off their ‘postcode’ and can’t afford to live somewhere decent.... these councillors prove the point.
awww jackie was so sweet, i feel so sorry for her
Did anything actually get achieved in this meeting?
David Pincombe is so god dammed prescient
Constitution? Law? Illegal? Clerk? Chair? Councillor? Chairman? What? Sub-committe of the steering group????? POLITICAL GAIN? TURF WAR?!1?11?1
A camel is a horse that was designed by a committee
Their needs to be a series on this on Netflix. Absolute comedy gold
I do not need to subscribe as I *live* it
🤣🤣🤣
Weavers off the chain.
What is Jackie Weaver's role?
The “Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on” comment from Jackie being so plainly stated like it was a fact caught me so off guard
This is more like a Royston Vasey Parish Council meeting LMAO
This just shows the misogynistic behaviour of these people
He sounds like gollum
Ian, ian ur muted
"I've never seen such a strongly worded letter... 25 years... never seen anything like it"... you wanna get out a bit more, love!
The Council 🤣 what jokers
Its exactly these kind of underground, illegal, parish meetings that are destroying this country
I’m getting Hot Fuzz vibes from this. There is a collection of retired people in EVERY local area in Britain like this lmao
When someone tried to suggest a sub committee to the steering group 🙆🏽‍♀️😳 like dude read the room! 😂😂😂 you're in the middle of an all out parish coup!
"If" this goes viral 😂😂😂😂
A turf war? Thought this was Handforth, not La Scampia in Naples. When is Jackie going to admit Gennaro?
So is there a difference between Clerk and Proper Officer?
So funny this needs to be on prime time tv is better than some of the TV shows on at the moment
Will Netflix get the serial rights?
'I was kicked out last time'  Guys only line the whole time 'QUITE RIGHTLY'
Comedy of Errors 🤣 add in the toilet flushing in the background. Big up to Jackie!
House prices Handforth plummeting ...  probably not on that many people's des-res list to start with but strike it off now!
It's Jackie's way or the highway!
I have no idea where Handforth is but if I ever see a sign for it I'll put the foot down. Ugly exchanges.
Guess this has started a war of words 😂😂😂
This is ridiculous 😂
5.49 wtf
"Who is this woman?" *loud gasp*
Can we have a livestream of the next meeting please, we need this during these difficult times
It's all very "Allen Bennet" LOL
Jesus and these people have responsibility? little power hungry counselors aren't doing anything at all. Just slating one another & not doing anything for the local community. I hope they're not being paid. What a waste of time, badly handled & farcical mess
Does someone say 'bugger' at the start of this?
this is mint hahahhaahaha
Kindergarten politics... lol
"Ian, you're muted!" The Handforth saga has everything!
"Who is Alan Murdoch please?" "Yes please."
Can we please get an office like show based on this?  This is just intense
Never in the field of human zoom meetings has so little been said by so many  for so long.
😂😂😂👏👏👏👏 Absolute GOLD. Love this!
Every single person in this meeting clicks the Wish advert and purchases the product without a care in the world.
Mate old people always have to make a joke slash comment, cutting someone off
‘STOP TALKING!’
The Americans have Karen, we have Jackie Weaver, no contest.
Bet they voted for the Tories
Was that all scripted by Sartre?
And I thought national politicians were a bunch of buffoons.
Old people and technology 😂😂classic
David Pincombe - AKA THE ORACLE
Puddled bunch of pensioners, and they are the parish council.
david pincombe is onto something
DEMOCRACY IS DEAD...
They should outlaw these kind of people. Also, you can see why the UK is so cyclist unfriendly with desicated coffin dodgers like these making the council local decisions on everything.
Jackie Weaver is the MVP 😅🤣 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 and for anyone who may be confused, She has the authority.
Can we replace mrs browns boys with these please
this is like the beginning of a midsomer murders episode
A “turf war” favours the meeting in godfather 3
"I have a photograph of it", slick moves by Ian, looking forward to seeing it once developed.
If you want a laugh you should watch Central Beds committee meetings.  They are very similar and have an equal number of berks.  They actually ask members to wake up when its time for them  to vote.
It's just back to back bangers!
some proper angry little men in this video. The future of Britain would look a lot better if its multiple levels of government weren't more representative of a bingo hall than the country's population.
not David only chiming in to predict how this would go viral
Typical Tory / Brexiteers. Sooner that ilk die off the better for the world
HPC tier list when? Alan’s iPad is clearly S tier.
Why can I hear Golem at 5:50 lmaooo
They achieved absolutely f all, they should all be sacked and young people replace them. It’s disgusting behaviour. So sad.
“The Vice Chair’s here, I’M IN CHARGE”  One of the most unexpected and aggressive coups of all time.
He's not the Clerk of the Handforth Parish Council Planning & Environment Committee, He's a very naughty boy...
Lol. Gold.
Dance mix please
"Will you stop talking!!??"
Or.... negotiations like these: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_72jEeaC_gE - to take home at weekends...!
This can't be real jesus christ XD
Countrys fcked ..... all I can say.
“I don’t see why not, Chairman.” - famous last words. 🤪
READ THEM UNDERSTAND THEM! I'M IN CHARGE 😂 howling.
This is the pilot episode to The Office follow-up: “The Council“
Has this been written/performed by Robert Popper??
Directed by Quentin tarentino
Birkenhead summed up
''Shut up for a minute, please. Where else can we go? Pollution, the environment. Litter. Dog shit.'' ''Aiming high.'' ''We aimed high, now we're at dog shit.''
Are these people employed or are they volunteers?
Can't stop laughing at this. So funny
This is a riot 😂😂😂
God help the folk of Handforth because the local council are a bunch of narcissists
All my homies hate Jackie Weaver...
"We don't want a turf war breaking out" 🤣🤣🤣
Chaos!!
"Will you stop being whatever it is you're trying to be" big OOF
They're getting expenses for this
"This
WILL YOU ALL STOP TALKING AND LISTEN! IT'S THE LAW. I AM THE ONE WHO KNOCKS
You so know these people all voted for Brexit.
That has to be the most English thing I've ever seen.
"Will you stop being whatever it is you are trying to be" - Handforth PC Clerk. Such wise words, such deep meaning, Ghandi could never. Buddha who?
What a lot of bollocks. This lot couldn’t organise a shag in a brothel.
Jackie Weaver could be 2021's answer to Carole Baskin.
"I've never seen such a strongly worded letter from a Monitoring Officer to a Local Council."    Jackie Weaver
why does gollum drop in and curse the fact hes in a teams meeting
Get rid of councillors  ffs
Authority is not given to you, Jackie, to deny the return of the Chairman!
A very productive meeting
This kind of bureaucratic pontificating by inefficient and complete out of touch lunatics is why nothing ever changes for the better in the UK.
This is why nothing gets done. These lunatics are all insane.
Someone please do a dance remix of this using the best quotes. Some suggestions: F**k off I can't see Jackie Weaver Mrs Weaver please!!! You have no authority here Jackie Weaver She's kicked him out  Read them and understand them!!! Where's the chairman gone? Here comes the subpoena!!!
I’m pretty sure this is the early, unseen pilot of Game of Thrones.
Is this Myanmar Coup d'etat? No wonder we get pot holes in the roads what a bunch off ass holes.
Hilarious! It could have been written for a Dad's Army episode!!
Holy shit this is GOLD
Beats PM q's
5:47 hahahahahha.
This is no Sandford meeting. at least they can decide on the greater good.
This new vicar of dibley is strange
9:51 - That virtual waiting room must be absolute carnage. Big fan of Alan's iPad - seems to cool for all of this nonsense.
Is this the new the office?
It's the UK in microcosm. There's no hope.
"READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!!!!"   My all time favorite line from any movie ever.
Is this the new series of the Vicar of Dibley ?
On the one hand this is hilarious. So much drama in a Parish council meeting lmaoo. But I'm also raging listening to the disgraceful and disrespectful behaviour of these men. Deeply misogynistic.
Jackie Weaver be power trippin9.
A video recording of this is all I would want if trapped on a desert island. To remind me of the alternative
Chairman: The council will decide your fate  Jackie Weaver: I am the council  Aled’s Ipad: Not yet!
We need Britney Spears to chair all public debates
What a lot of gammon
Wondering why people don' trust politicians ! The beauty of bureaucracy !
The next cast of I'm a celebrity.
This dis track is gonna cause one hell of a turf war..
Jackie is like the modern day Hyacinth Bucket🤣🤣
This is England......at its very best. Hillarious
Give me this over a Hollywood thriller any day.
I want HPC on a t shirt
Is Jackie a proper officer? Or a clerk? Or just a volunteer?
5:49 Gollum has entered the chat
How not to run a Zoom Meeting   I'm still not really sure if this is real life and not satire LOL   If this goes viral .....   Who knew!
This has everything.
5:49 gollum joins the meeting 😂
ooooppphhh, this is horrible
We're trying to have a teams meeting you fool!
This is a wonderful example of why nothing gets done in a bureaucracy. I imagine the European Commission is exactly like this, except it’s 18 years not 18 minutes.
Guess when you're old and there's not much going on in your life, you've got to be petty over whatever you can be.
The bullying demonstrated by the chair and vice chair is awful. The rest of the members showed dignity and restraint.
"The chairman of the council is the... erm... chairman of the... erm... council" still better writing than the final series of game of thrones
I love the way they have caught Julie explaining to someone that she can't talk as she is in a meeting, seemingly oblivious that the world is overhearing her
Cyn: "No"
Why is aled impersonating Voldemort 😂😂
We are all Aled’s iPad at 5:26
"I have never seen such a strongly worded letter from a monitoring office to a local council. I've never seen anything like it." RELEASE THE LETTER JACKIE
Nice to see the smooth cogs of democracy at work here
You cant remove the chairman. You have no authority here..... Click.
Boys V. girls.
They need to do a Handforth come Dine with me special, I'd watch it.
Alan's a boy...
We don't want a turf war 🤣🤣🤣
As someone who has been thinking of getting into the local council - this looks fun. Although I do get why Obi Wan wasn't brave enough for politics.
"If this goes viral on the internet, it's gonna start a war of words." Oh boy, I can't wait for the sequel.
Jackie: right chairman's gone, let's pick a new chairman. I vote me 😂
0:06 can we just appreciate Roger Small doing a very artistic half spin to face the camera like the start of a music video.
It ll be bloody night time before the meeting starts !
Just imagine if you upscaled this and formed a union of 27 countries all having meetings about meetings and squabbling among themselves!
What is the actual premise of thus meeting? Croissant pushing beurocracy in its finest form
"25 years I've never seen anything like it." Me neither, Jackie.
OMG this is gold!! .... I literally want an invite to the next meeting!!! - you have just made me realise my teams disastrous Zoom calls are in fact super professional and well organised!!!
Didn't know there was a prequel to HotFuzz, sweet!
The new RickRoll. 👍🏻
“We’re trying to have a teams meeting you fool!”
I always wondered why it takes so long for planning permission to be approved by the council now I know why.
I hope #swedemason does a remix of this.
The biggest joke here is that Parish Councils have absolutely NO POWER when it comes to Planning. All they can do is express an opinion. The decisions on Planning are made at District Council level (or Unitary Council if you live in one of those). Furthermore - are they one of those Councils where the elections were cancelled last year? If so - NONE of them have a democratic mandate & they're all just pretenders to the Parish throne.
Surely the edits in this video make this council look even worse. They might've actually done some work, haha. Although I'm amazed at the egos and the need to speak to others as they are children.
The trouble is these committee meetings are in fact illegal based on the outdated constitutions. There is nothing that allows anything other than face to face contact in the same room. That is why there were no other meetings held mentioned in the video. Many committees I know have operated on force majure (no choice under the current emergency) until the relevant statutes have been changed to allow video conferences.
Here comes the subpoeana! WTF does that even mean
Cyn clamping Sue constantly whenever she makes a point, definitely past beef between them
I love the flushing cistern in the background
This group of people (representatives of a community?) does not get any work done. No wonder the environment is suffering. I don't even think it is funny: it is a total disgrace.
misogynistic idiots, these mens are a reflection of males in the Church.  Absolutely appaling. The egos and judgmental attitude in the Church are why ppl are leaving and Churches are becoming empty.
This is exactly why politics needs stripping out of local government. https://www.flatpackdemocracy.co.uk/ is the way to go.
Loving this 'The Thick of It' lockdown special
Thank you Handforth for such a gift
Pity the residents of this parish council...I would expect that nothing ever gets done but I'm sure they'll stick their noses in everyone's business and interfere to their detriment.
10 seconds in and I’m laughing uncontrollably. The subtle fuck off was amazing
Real life The Thick of it
"If this goes viral..."
The concept of the monitoring office reminds me of the concept of the headmaster that teachers who couldn't control kids at school used to use - a vague and unpleasant nuclear weapon that will stop all the fun.
This a roller coaster from start to finish lmao
I can't stop watching this
This is where The Thick of It gets its material
This is my 3rd watch
Some truly great method acting on display here.
Just what I needed to cheer me up on my birthday! Hilarious!
Brave of them to schedule the next meeting on Microsoft patch Tuesday
“hfajixsjndbwuswndbwl we’re trying to do a teams meeting YOU FOOL”
This is high art
Jackie Weaver is my Queen 👑 ❤️ Handled that like a champ!
Please Join my Church.  I think not.  These ppl are disgusting.  It reflect religion.  No spirutualiry whats so ever.  Just judgmental egocentric maniacs.
Handforth sounds like he’s trying to do a little girl voice it’s so funny when he goes ‘STOP TALKING’
BBC Parliament needs to start showing these meetings 🙏
Poor Ian was muted, lagged, and just managed to get "just um" out before he was unceremoniously cut off.  Perfect comedic timing.
READ THEM & UNDERSTAND THEM...!
She’s kicked him out.....
this is absolute fucking iconic hahahahah
You have no authority Jackie Weaver!  Jackie Weaver: Clicks.... Goodbye 👋
1.75x  !
The most British thing I've ever seen 😁
Why did the one guy turn into gollum
Bunch of power hungry nobody's 😒 😑
“you cant kick me out you don’t have the authority” *kicks him out* omg 😭
David: "I think if this goes viral on the internet or whatever, it's going to start a war of words"  Internet: Strangers bonding together over watching 18 minutes of nothing but pure meme-able content
Brilliant 👏 👏 👏
15:20 John Smith pissing himself at his own joke is where I lost it
People complaining about cinemas being closed and not being able to watch any intense movies, just tune into your local parish council meeting
I hope Julie got back to whoever it was who called her.
Fire them all. Utterly useless
I thought Meryl Streep was wonderful as Jackie Weaver. Bravo!
If this goes viral comment.....lol
Yes- all very funny...... Until you realise that this is a perfect microcosm of how the entire country is 'run'  A bunch of doddery, self-important nitwits discussing what they should be discussing, and who should be discussing it, and in what manner it should be discussed until the discussion is over with the chairman concluding, "Ashleigh- oops, I nearly said his name then, has not attended a meeting in six months. October, November, December, and March. The fact that no meetings were held is irrelevent." (A line that any of the great sit-com writers would be applauded for thinking up) Are we all just going to sit here, imprisoned in our own homes, chuckling at these people until it's all too late?.....
Just waiting for the booted chap to announce he is a free man on the land, operating under common law. Classic stuff.
Please someone make me a badge that says Clerk of Handforth Parish Council?
These men are bullies. Can't deal with a woman holding power.
This is why nothing gets done 😂
This is exactly why nobody volunteers for any sort of office, whether it be the PC, Boy Scouts, Village Hall etc...etc...
“That will be interesting for other parties to hear it.”  And the rest, John.
John Smith is a legend!
This is what happens when a group of self-satisfied, self-serving Tories get together to run things …
A sub committee of the sub committee, 🤣😂🤣
they're fighting in white privelledge 🤣
John smith is my favourite
Execute order 66
Handforth - The place where every resident is actually on Parish Council for the greater good of the community in which everybody hates each other
Teacher to 7 year old Tony Smith:- well Mr Smith, what do you want to be when YOU grow up?  Mr Smith:- I want to be a pilot!  Teacher to 7 year old Hannah Green:- well Miss Green, what do you want to be when YOU grow up?  Miss Green:- I want to be a doctor!  Teacher to 7 year old Jackie Weaver:- well Miss Weaver, what do you want to be when YOU grow up?  Miss Weaver:- I want to be a Proper Officer of a council!  Teacher:- what's that? Is that like a clerk?  Miss Weaver:- NO!! IT'S NOT LIKE A CLERK!!
Can’t wait for handforth the musical.
Boomers: Young people are so disrespectful and argumentitive these days! Also boomers:
I'm guessing that pothole still needs filling then?
This is why we have Brexit and this is why we have Boris Johnson as PM
Booze up...and brewery spring to mind...these people are Lunatics.
05:48 *Gollum has entered the chat*
The cream of British politics
Jackie is a fucking Queen
"Can we make this recording available?" "I don't see why not"  Hi, my name is Twitter.
Painful but entertaining
Welcome to stony bridge
Can someone please explain the outcome of this meeting? Forming a new sub committee isn't an answer by the way.
Can someone please get me some adoption papers to join the Brewerton household. They seem like a right laugh.
5:48 is that Gollum?
David with his finger on the pulse, he knew this was going viral from the start
this is like watching old people WWE
sounds like an Archers plotline
Cyn wrong
A total bunch of blubbering idiots god help the residents of their parish. Clowns
Clearly a lot of things happened before this meeting - accusations of corruption etc and we donn;t know they rights and wrongs of it all, but..what is certainly clear from the video is how rude and obnoxious the old men are from the outset. They were clearly determined the meeting was not going to work and behaved like obnoxious teens from the start. They should be nowhere near a parish council. One has to wonder if those acting most stroppily are those with questions to answer?
Never thought small council meetings would be this entertaining lol
The old guy who got kicked off  'again; was the only one who was speeaking sense. It was a bit like, a Monty Python sketch, loved it......This is how people behave who wannabe councillors and think they are celebrities,,,,,,
5:49 Didn't know Gollum was a member of the council. Must have been in a recent by-election.
“A cocktail of passive aggression, poor internet connection and technological incompetence” - Time Magazine
Ok Google, please show me the definition of jobsworth.
This is a treasure trove for meme creators "...you can call me Britney Spears from now on!"
Laughing so much I’m crying. OMG !!!! Jackie Weaver for PM.  Oh sorry, Britney for PM.
“The chairman of the council is the chairman of the .... council.”
Every stuck up little Village in the UK has these type of people, they are the most up their own **** people you could ever want to meet.  I am gifted as the local electrician with the best customers in the world, but I will not touch several of the local village councilors in several local Villages for all the money on Earth, they are the worst people who crave power, horrible people
Jackie called john a chairman, how many chairman are they
why does the guy at 7:44 look like alex lifeson??
“Oh hiya, I’m just in a meeting at the moment...”
Alan Murdoch such a gyalist 😂
I want to move there. Best laugh I've had in lockdown
Zoom is such a waste of bandwidth. All you need is a pic of someone's face and a chat window. Keyboard chat would do or audio only. Notice that in trying to stream video the audio suffers most. Just bin the video. Seems odd to me that everyone should not have the ability to re-join at will or kick anyone else off for being an absolute arse!
This is pure comedy gold :)
Gollum turning up to the meeting at 6 mins in.
No wonder bugger all gets done at the local level.
You can't win Jackie Weaver. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
Our country is doomed.
Nice for Gollum to make an appearance at 5:50
Wow the budget for the Unfriended franchise has really been hit hasn't it
this is like something from the pen of Lewis Carroll
PRICELESS. last few words. CAN WE MAKE THIS VIDEO AVAILABLE......HANDFORTH is now going to be the Busy Body capital of the U.K. This is better than the WHEELTAPPERS AND SHUNTERS CLUB.    What we need is January's instalment and after this expose February's ZOOM meeting to see what the publicity they have brought onto themselves been discussed.   Brings back Memories of DIBLEY PARISH COUNCIL. David , Hugo, Geraldine and NO NO NO NO Frank. And Mrs Cropley and Owen. All seem to be in attendance in HANDFORTH. Bring on the next Zoom instalment.   I can see the YT comments been read out at all the publicity they have garnered at their next meetings. I'd say the phones in HANDFORTH are hopping today.......
Oh My Word 🤣
Pure comedy gold
"Starring Trevor Horn as Sue." No? Just me, then.
Um ,um - it's a world record for ums.
Julie is in a meeting lol.
This has made lockdown so much better
this is carnage and i love it
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE JACKIE WEAVER!
If this committee was tasked with designing a horse, they'd come up with a 3 legged camel...or a 4 legged one who they'd then mute from working!! hahaha
"We don't want a turf war breaking out" 🤣🤣🤣
Behaviour on both sides was appalling. What's more worrying is the coup d'etat going on, no way would Jackie Weaver get away with this in normal circumstances absolutely appalling. You don't agree bye-bye we will make decisions without you. Democracy in action. What a joke.
Part 2 gonna be a banger....,2nd Tuesday in January
Shouldn’t John Smith get back to hosting The Chase?
Is there somewhere we can get a whos who for this?
We have started the war of words David
Sad little men
how typical of our politics, a collection of angry middle aged idiots
"If this goes viral, it could start a turf war" well bad luck lads
Those men on this parish council are disgraceful.  Jackie deserves an award for having to deal with this lot.
"WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE A TEAMS MEETING YOU FOOL"
Jackie is a queen!
Jackie Weaver is my spirit animal
God no wonder local government is a shambles.
Why do the council have ppl who already have 1 foot in the grave? Surely they should have some 20 year old at least
Roger Small thinks he's reporting on News at Ten 😂😂😂
Infinitely better than Gogglebox
This is better than 'Tiger King". Can't wait for them to meet again....!!!!
7:10 toilet flush?🤣
you couldn’t write something as good as this hahaha
ooh gollums is a parish councillor
The fact that the first shot is someone not facing the right way, you knew it was going to be a wild ride
Heres me thinking Roger Small was too small to be seen on camera 11:07
As someone whom has a grandfather on a local council, I can assure you this is the mere 'tip' of the iceberg when it comes to bitter, petty, tit-for-tat, 'little Englander' politics which clag up  the local wheels of industry. You need 'affordable' homes to sort out housing crisis? No. but, we can quite cheerfully put all our efforts into arguing whether a pothole cover should be x3 inches further away from the corner of someone's drive because a local has deemed it 'an eyesore'.
😂 Class
"We have decided...you are not little orcs."
Love the comment , “stop being what you want to be” haha
#istandwithjackieweaver
i love how roger small; accidentally added a ; to his name but didn't delete it
When's the creature comfort version out 😭
What I love is the humour! Great to see!
Jackie Weaver the control freak
the cackles of an insane man at 6:04
It that Golum off camera?
Know wonder why nothing gets done in England every won Star arguing and nothing gets done. They are Like kids in a sweet shop
Vice Chair is a piece of work
I hearby claim all movie and TV series rights to this content and context.  I has the supremest of authoritaire in this claim
Bureaucracy, bureaucracy, bureaucracy - probably just like the parliament.. bet they all voted Brexit as well.
So...As Jackie hosted the zoom meeting she gets unlimited power?
Jackie Weaver has now been placed in a witness protection programme and given a new identity............Hyacinth Bouquet apparently 😳
And if TV producers do not make a sitcom based around this then they've missed a massive trick.
Cyn talks a lot of sense. She should be the clerk.
Jackie is trying to implement a coup. Free (whoever the many first guy is)!!!!!!
John Smith for PM
Cyn completely blocking those people being brought back in was a disappointment, not gonna lie. I wanted part 2 of the bad guys.
That's the best video I have seen this week. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
jackie is delutional and needs to be stopped
All together now “it’s a member of the public”!
This is just pure unscripted British comedy gold 😂 it's like something the League of Gentlemen have written 😂
“When do we plan to start”  “Fuck off.”
These people couldn't run a piss-up in a brewery.
This made me want to move to Handforth, seems like a bunch of lively chaps over there
Who flushes the toilet at 7:12
Absolutely nothing happens here yet its hilarious
In the first few seconds it already starts with a bang when he muttered “fuck off”
"Sat there like a laughing hyena"
Guys you’re not the EC.... but you could be.
4:22 OOOhh he ain't happy!!  "READ THE STANDING ORDERSS!!! READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM"!!😠😡 *GASP!* 😮
Contrary to popular belief, George R R Martin actually got his inspiration for Game of Thrones from British Parish council meetings.
"Handforth" - soon to be a major HBO miniseries.
The two gammons who piss their pants at the notion of respecting a woman
5:48 what the actual fuck is that?
If this is typical of local councils meeting then no wonder it takes an eternity to get a street light fixed
Short of the words "shut up woman" I honestly find older men who talk like this to women and indeed all people absolutely despicable.
5:50 My preciousssssssss
God forbid if this was happening in person and not on Zoom 😂
Piss up and brewery spring to mind .One council member didn't attend any meetings for six months .The fact that no meetings were held is irrelevant  .You can't make this up hahaha
And this is why nothing gets done in this country
Thanks for uploading this. This is really taking off 👍👍👍👍👍
Point of order to Julie’s iPad!!!
This is a satirical masterpiece, better than the office
You must know the basic law... I’d have thought
Any why is it local councils have such a bad rep...  with this lot in charge...
The men in this video are vile creatures. Total bullies.
This is Brilliant! LOL
I live over seas now but god I love little Britain
“You are on this council, but we don’t grant you the rank of clerk.” - Mace Windu
According to Aled Brewerton (Vice Chair) LinkedIn Profile - he's an experienced solicitor skilled in "dispute resolution" lol
16:18 he knew!!!!
What a joke. Bumbling morons.
3:58 "You have no authority here Jackie Weaver, no authority AT ALL."  "She's just kicked him out!"  Don't fk with Jackie Weaver.
Grumpy old gammons doing what they do best!
When's the next episode ? Can't wait too long
Where’s the cat?
Barry Burkhill, one of the 'Councillors', is also Mayor of Cheshire East Council - phew, that's a relief!!   It is well documented that the Clerk to the Council is also the proper officer. It is not an elected post, it automatically comes with the job of Clerk. Now who doesn't know the law, now who doesn't know what he's talking about!!!
It's treason then
Obviously a total bunch of complete blithering idiots ! A punnet of stuffed mushrooms could have achieved more. The asides made them a laughing stock.  I did however note that Jackie Weaver was the absolute double of chef Rosemary Shrager.  Sending condolences to the people of Handforth for having a Parish Council that couldn't organise a p*** up in a brewery !
Coup d'etat
David Pincombe knew this gold would go viral. Can't wait for the Hanford Parish Council to be sponsored by raid shadow legends!
Alan on his iPad - Roy Hodgson
Sue is the real OG.
Why wasn't John Bercow in this episode? About his level.
Power struggle,pieces are moving,big players making big moves!
Great pilot episode cant wait for the first season
Aled’s iPad putting shame on the family name. I hope Julie’s iPad sorts him out before the next iPad family reunion 😤
Brilliant...
😂
I wonder if  Boris’s meetings are as exciting as this.
the hunger for power here is exceptional.
Trigger happy Jackie kicked him out swiftly.
“Can we make this recording available?”@17:00. Famous last words...
I'd love to be in the council chamber when normality returns.. will the sergeant at arms be called to remove the naughty boys? pmsl
I hate it when you start watching a show half way through. They should at least have had a recap of the previous episode.
You all want to grow up , your old enough
No one:  Julie's iPad: "gaaaaaaasp" 😂🤣
What the fuck are these people doing with their lives?
This is the greatest indie movie of all time
Parish clerks has a lot of power and influence.  Strictly they are ‘Officers’ and the Councillors are ‘Members”. What the Parish Clerk does in this meeting is ‘Undemocratic” and  against the  ‘Standing Orders of Good Governance “   Their reason for Parish Clerks having ‘ undue influence and power’ is because they are in their posts till they decide to resign, whilst the members changes regularly. “Unprofessional Parish Clerks” do bully members and often members with little professional knowledge of ‘ local governance “ can be misled and bullied into submission.  What is shown here is what is actually happening through the parishes.  Note, that here Jackie  has a lot of influence and power.  She is probably well meaning but definitely ‘WRONG” to take over the meeting.
Haha this is mutiny against the chair!
Useless, well-meaning idiots. Made my day 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
sue to win the game of thrones
5:45 Seems like Gollum joined the call.
Brilliant!
We STAN Jackie.
I've fact-checked and the clerk and will be the proper officer, so Jackie is right 😂😂
Alas this is not the exception this is the norm in every Local Council, Local Authority up and down the UK (and to be honest in every part of the world) - you have self elected individuals who believe they are rulers of the world (or their little part of the world) and act accordingly.   While we may all snigger that these antics just realise that people like this and others like them make decisions that affect lives of ordinary hard working people.   I worked in Councils for 7 years and I know how many of the "members" don't have half a brain between them.
I feel we shall soon discover who stole whose broccoli casserole recipe...
Apart from all the funny bits, it shows just how bad councils work and how disrespectful they treat each other. Be aware who you elect.
The chairman of the council is the, the, the.....chairman of the council....
Bet the chairman is great fun at parties......and I bet the Chuckle Brothers really ARE fun at parties...total comedy.....
this is perfect
Jackie Weaver to be on I'm a celeb this year. Calling it!
This is the most British thing I’ve seen for a long long time 😬
Once the vaccine takes effect, these meetings will become redundant, anyway.
'I think that if this goes viral on the internet, or Facebook or whatever, it's going to start a war of words.'  David Pincombe - confirmed prophet.
I always thought The Vicar Of Dibley was a comedy, now I realise it's a documentary.
This is gold 😂😂😂
This is bloody brilliant
Typical England typical middle management chaos....... Where is the the chairman?
Oh wow, some real loudmouth entitled old gits on this call, starting a fight in an empty house! 😂 Makes every other zoom call in history look slick and harmonious. I'd want a stiff drink for a call like that!
John Smith is my spirit animal
these men are all idiots
Go on Jackie
6:14 David Pincombe is clearly a fortune-teller.
John Smith's summary needs printing on T-shirts: "What I would say is that it was a very good example of bullying within Cheshire East... and the environs"
I didn’t know anything about Handforth where I lived would go viral 😂
These are the types of people who should be losing their jobs during all this Covid business.  What a waste!
Just needs Ronnie Pickering to make an appearance. Dying laughing here
Oh god it's my parish...
This would never happen  in China.  China is a harmonious country. People are conditioned by 5000 years of culture to be respectful and follow the party's guiding hand with Mr Xi as the great helmsman and Xi Jingping Thought as our lodestar. Britain is old and stinky.
Typical, they spend more time on petty issues and personal vendettas than getting any meaningful issues solved in the interest of the community they represent.
Hysterical. Tensions are running high in lockdown 😂😂😂
We don't want a turf war breaking out  ;) ...
Julie’s I Pad is just in a meeting, please call her later.
Well I dunno about you. But I need to read the Standing Orders.
As a European this is how I imagine that Brexit was decided.
will you stop being whatever it is you’re trying to be - winnie the pooh
Who is the Smeagol at 5.45?
Jackie Weaver ftw!
Raise a hand when you want to speak; raises his hand on screen :)
But who is the Clerk of the Council? I just want to know........???
What was the meeting about? I've  no idea other than having sub committee of the steering group was considered to be a shit idea😁
I love the guy who is hardly in shot because he is more interested in showing off his guitar collection than positively contributing anything meaningful. I think we've all been stuck in Zoom meeting with someone like that over the past year.
Parish councils, the bain of parishes for years.
These people are pathetic. Apart from Jackie. Jackie wins
IDK if Jackie is acting illegally, but if they are, this is a stupid law and it is hilarious how upset they got.
Crikey, the people you elect, put your trust in, bickering like kiddies in a playgroup. Annalise it and all the key players you see in a gang of kids are there. The bully, the know-all, the playmaker, the pacifist, the calm & logical child...amazing how what you see in a child states with them into 'maturity.' It reminded me so much of the Sports Club meetings I had to attend as the groundsman.  I used to wonder how it could begin at 18.00h and finish 3 to 4 hours later without achieving very much other than inflating some already pumped-up egos.
Most British thing I’ve seen.
Lol and this all within the 'united' kingdom. My advicevis stay clear of anything that requires a chairperson or standing orders. Who do you think you are kidding mr hitler......
The bloke called himself ‘clerk of the council’ on his FaceTime tag.. absolute lad
Jackie Weaver, a true anti-hero
Jackie holds the paid subscription to Zoom, launches a military coup....
Read them and understand them!!!!!
Jackie ain’t no bitch 😂
‘He hasn’t attended a meeting in 6 months.. there haven’t been any meetings held, but that isnt relevant’
Time for the residents of Handforth to call for a new Parish Council.
This is like a cross between the Council of Elrond and Curb Your Enthusiasm.
Welcome to Royston Vasey - You'll never leave.
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE, JACKIE WEAVER
“WE’RE TRYING TO HAVE A TEAMS MEETING YOU FOOL”
5:48       *Gollum has entered the chat*
Useless the lot of them and Jackie Weaver clearly hasn't a clue and is very vindictive.
We don’t want a turf war breaking out!  Peter. Calm down.
Parish Council= A collection of unimportant people trying desperately to give themselves a sense of self importance and control over their local community who usually despise them. As the average lifespan in the UK is increasing there is shortage of these positions so we've had to invent the role of "special constable" to help unimportant people get the sense of power they crave.
I loved this meeting! Sums up most local authority meetings 😂
Brilliant!
"Hiya, I’m Clark of the Parish Council at the moment.  Can I call you back?"
Oh this is priceless comedy.
dam this is better than Eastenders.
Get those guitars in shot mate 😂
How is this the best video I’ve watched so far this year?
this has improved my 2021 😭
Absolutely brilliant!!
“When do we plan to start?” “...f**k off...”
is this a leak of a cabinet meeting?
US Politics has the Capitol Hill riots, UK politics has this
And that’s how nothing is done. All the time and energy is put into the efforts of taking control and establishing the order of action...
Barry Burkill is an under appreciated character. Arguably deserves a spin-off.
Why do they all just hate each other 😂😂
@6:53  Led Zeppelin shows up to the meeting to accuse people of being bullies when they tried to simply enforce the rules!🤣🤣
I could watch this all day, this is superb!
13:32"He haven't attended a meeting in 6 months, there was no meetings but thats irrelevant "How can he attend a meeting if there was no meetings? lol.
I thought Hot Fuzz was over exaggerating these small town councils. But I guess it's pretty lively.
Finally the UKs answer to Tiger King.
"can we make this recording available?"  Wish granted
I thought the toilet flush was a nice touch 😂
hilarious,...This is surely a bbc comedy. You cann't be serious!!
WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY QUENTIN TARINTINO
You're on mute Ian!  hahahaha
Go on Barry Burkhall!
"Oh, hiya! I'm... Yeah, I'm just in a meeting at the moment. Can I give you a call back when it finishes? Ok, all right, bye! Bye!" 3:02
OLD FOLK NEED TO KNOW WHEN TO HANG UP THEIR GLOVES AND CALL IT A DAY
Alan, member of the public, coming in with the comic relief and sex appeal. Has everyone giggling.  Peter, member of the public, makes John giggle affectionately. I smell a will-they-won't-they romance on the cards.  Looking forward to seeing where this is going. Especially with Cyn shutting down all of Sue's ideas, developing a bitter rivalry.
this is Shakespeare
“We don’t want a turf war breaking out”
They should put this on HBO instead of Series 8 of Game of Thrones
Odds on Roger Small having a massive Schlong
DOES THESE PPL GET PAID FOR THIS?
Nice one Jackie Weaver 👏👍
House of cards (UK) pilot episode
Cyn is a Karen
What’s said at 5:30, sounds like “here comes the subpoena!”? 😂
"No they can't because the Vice Chair's here. I take charge! Read the standing orders! READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!" 4:18
Wow that was one angry man... I think he needs a few anger management sessions
Great example of how woeful subtitles generated by speech-recognition software can be - handful instead of Handforth and Monica instead of moniker
What a load of bollocks
What a joke, these jokers have actual.power. Inept and tied up in legalese, waste of time.
5:49 for what I can only assume was the Devil being exorcised from Aled.
This is typical British democracy mob rule. Then like communist china kicking out the chair of the meeting 👏👏 well done your now reduced to a meme and a laughing stock 😆 😄
Soviet style takeover by Jackie weaver 💪🏽
Jackie Karen Weaver doesn't throw footballs back over her garden fence, steps in front of cars she perceives as driving too fast, leaves her shopping cart in a parking space, hates anyone under the age of 30, tells children off in the park for swearing and being too loud... please carry this on
Half a million views - and counting!  I think it is safe to say that this has put Handforth on the map. :)
Jackie Weaver might be my favourite character on YouTube!
Is this the new Mike Leigh film?
F***ing hilarious!
"He failed to attend the last 4 meetings. The fact that there were no meetings held is irrelevant" :D :D :D :D
He's NOT the Clerk of the Parish Council, he's a very naughty boy!
oh my god. best thing.
This just gets better and better
Who is Alan Murdoch?
This is gold! Bloomin eck Jackie
Comedy Gold
"We're trying to have a Teams meeting, you fool. We're trying to have a Teams meeting, you fool!" 5:50
God help us now we are out of europe and have to decide things ourselves in meetings
England is full of people like this, unfortunately
Roger Small is the spit of Michael Aspall
Jackie weaver is clearly pulling the strings
"READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!" Aled's son/friend has no chill, haha.
This is everything wrong with village Britain and Local councils and councillors, bunch of morons, absolutely pathetic
THESE VERY "small" COUNCILS 😅😅😅 PROB ZOOMING ABOUT THE TEA BAGS FOR 2025 VILLAGE FAIR.
Man becomes gollum at 5:56
I hope to God they bring out episode 2
By far the most entertaining TV of this lockdown. Pure comedy gold. Can’t wait for the next episode!
I bet Cyn is fun at parties lmao
"The chairman of the council is the chairman of the.... er ..... council."
I'm watching this from Iraq
5:50 Aled’s audition for the part of Gollum in lord of the rings
This is so hilarious and also tragic.
I think jCkie weaver has a agenda maybe a few back handers underthe table for planning and so forth 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔think!!!
And you wonder why this country is going down the toilet.
This is the best bit of telly I've watched in months!  When can I expect the next episode?
0:10 - "fuck off" 🤣
When he turns in Golem!
Julies IPad is MOTM
Apologies to Jackie Weaver but welcome to Handforth!
I think Jackie weaver hasn't got a clue what she's doing, she probably takes to Facebook to report people's posts.
Whats the name of tbe individual who made the Birkenhead comment?
John smith is loving it
This has made my day.  Whoever started it gets my vote!  Just what we need in these gloomy days x
13:53 - the fact that there were no meetings held is irrelevant! :D
(muted chuckling) gold.
Funniest Thing I've seen in quite a while 😂😂😂
This is an absolute masterpiece. “The Chairman of the Council is the... is the Chairman of the... of the... of the Council.” Crying 😭😭
VOTE JACKIE!
This is hilarious pure entertainment.😆🤣
Never Mind The Ballots, will the real Parish Clerk please step forward...
Sexagenarian rule...
God I forgot how bitchy meeting can be ....brilliant
this is magnificent
What a bunch of immature little misogynistic pigs
'I have NEVER seen such a strongly worded letter from a monitoring officer to a local council' OMG This is brilliant!
haha funny thing is this is how i imagine PC would be like lol
Just sums up the arrogant geriatric fools who infest the parish councils, in general they have no experience or knowledge but vast egos, sadly normal people do not go on these councils because they have to actually work for a living and in any case that unless you are in the right clique you will be ignored and abused.
I’m from Cheshire and I’m really not surprised this happened. Why are they so angry ? 😂
16:16 - How did David know? I think he's a mole.
16:10 the turf war has begun!!
All the Dibley characters are here...just not quite so likeable. Bit like a cross with Royston Vasey
New series of Little Britain. Is the clerk a LOCAL?
"Let's propose that we set up a sub-committee of the committee for that very thing." Bureaucracy in all its splendor.
Please call me Britney Spears from now on 🤣🤣
He missed the meetings but the fact no meeting was held is irrelevant ... what? 😂😂
Ian the mute
'You have no authority here, Jackie Weaver'. One minute later and he's kicked out of the group lol
What did that meeting actually achieve?
5:49 the voice of Gollum appears
That's fucking illegal.
Lenin dissolves the First Duma (1918)
I can't wait to find out that these are in fact the Handforth Players and this is the greatest piece of amateur dramatics ever performed.
I don’t know what’s worse. The meeting of stuffy old people or people in the comments that actually know what’s even going on 😂😂😂😂  I’m so fucking lost right now
He's not the clerk of the parish council, he's a very naughty boy.
This lot couldn't run a piss up in a brewery .....
You have no authority here Jackie Weaver, none at all........(press exit here) 😂😂😂😂😂😂.  Julies I pad 'I'm just in a meeting at the moment'......lol why does everyone above 50 forget to mute lol
People with to much power after discovering they could communicate via zoom. Power crazy liberals
This is hilarious  HILARIOUS  We, the people need this  in our lives right now  Let's treasure these oddballs who walk among us I love Jackie for being Jackie
John Smith's laughing could not be better timed!
16:33 head down - sums up my feelings at this anti-democratic shower of buffoons.
Typical gynocracy
This is class
"he did not attend meetings for 6 months, the fact there were no meetings during that time however is irrelevant"
Haven't got my diary infront of me...ffs
You could not write a better comedy sketch!
Jackie: "I have never seen such a strongly-worded letter from a monitoring officer to a local council. 25 years, I've never seen anything like it." John: "You've not been to Handforth often enough." This is gold, but is anyone else now desperate to see this letter!? And also, that wonderful moment at 17:02 when it dawns on John that if they make the recording publicly available, they're all going to become overnight celebrities and put Handforth on the map. You can almost see the little Hollywood signs light up in his eyes.
Jackie Weaver did what Trump supporters tried and failed to do in the Capitol.
Jacky Weaver and her followers later assassinated John Smith in the senate chamber, declaring the death of the Republic and declaring herself First Consul.
This was excellent 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I watched it twice 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 You're Not the CHaIr JaCKiE 😂😂😂😂😂 absolute hilarious.  Who shared this 🤔😂😂😂 I'm guessing the guy at the end who asked for the video to be available...sneaky fish 😂😂😂  I love being British 😂😂😂
Looking forward to the next episode...
"When do we plan to start?" .... "Fuck off"
Enjoy the authority Jackie, I hope it makes you very happy
14.42.... Peter..... yeah, but look at my collection of guitars and amps!
*On Zoom* "We're trying to have a Teams meeting you fool!
*READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM*
If Brexit was a zoom
00:07 Chairman - "When do we plan to start?"  ".... Fuck off."
I work for a local authority. Transferring to Hanforth ASAP. Way more fun than our meetings.
I want to be on a parish council committee like this! Where can I sign up??!
I have to deal with parish councils as part of my job. The amount of big egos in such an ineffectual organisation never ceases to astound me.
David predicting it would go viral is uncanny. The war has begun.
This is everything you need to know about understanding who the English are :)
5:55 was that Golem?
"YOU'RE ON MUTE!"
Who needs Netflix? This is entertaining, we need MORE
They kicked Barry!!!
It's impossible for armando ianucci to write an original satire anymore because real life has become one. On a more serious not Zoom is making billions off these 'meetings' and 'Zoom' is now part of the vocabulary like 'Google'. It's a company cashing in on stupidity.
“The chairman of the council is the chairman of the... of the uhhh... council.”  Thanks for clearing that up for me Barry.
13:33 John Smith says a councillor missed 6 meetings, when only 4 had been held. Apparently missing meetings that haven’t been held, goes against you 🤔
JUST A THOUGHT WATCHING THAT  "did anything get sorted out "
Genuinely one of the greatest things I've ever seen.
Absolute classic British comedy. Fucking fantastic 😂 😂
“You have no authority here Jackie” ...... kicks him out with 1 click 😂 brilliant!👏🏻 big babies!
You people pay for this. These people live comfortable lives off your backs. I'm not sure who I hate more.
As soon as I heard "fuck off" I knew I was in for a good time!
Is this really the best democracy has to offer?
This is so much better than Netflix.
Read the standing orders!!! Aleds Ipad has Ronnie Pickering vibes
The whole spectacle is priceless, but I was well and truly brought up short when Smith pointed out that "One of the councillors from the West Ward did not attend a meeting for six months... the fact that there were no meetings held is irrelevant." Absolutely Pythonesque.
"I'm just glad it's a Zoom meeting!"
They should all give permission for this to be shown in full on Saturday evening TV. Ratings would go through the roof.
When setting up a sub committee it is critical to decide which committee, group or sub committee, it is a sub committee of (12:47).
I was waiting for “Jackie Weaver, You shall not pass”
Julie's call at the start was wonderful.
Democracy at work! 😂😂.... hope this lot aren't organising the vaccine roll out!
I hope these fine clowns are all volunteers, however I’m certain this is representative of salaried more senior governing bodies.  Needs Elon Musk to DynoRod the whole show. Painful to watch.
I'm desperate to know how someone can attend a meeting which didn't take place
Peter Kay... This should be giving you some AMAZING ideas!!!
It starts magnificently with someone saying “Oh f**k off” to an innocent question about when the meeting starts.   And actually gets better from there.
Isn't Handforth the next village along from Royston Vasey?
From a Handforth resident.... does anyone have a house for rent anywhere else in the country?
I 'observed' a recent community council meeting here in North Wales & it completely put me off ever thinking of volunteering for this when I retire. They spent a whole hour debating whether meetings should take place over Gotomeeting or Zoom - then deferred it to the next meeting!!
Reminds me of Life of Brian
Comedy gold!!! 🤣 🤣
Is this real life?
5:47 Gollum enters the chat
5:08 "The chairman of the council is the chairman of the, uh, council." He knows too much...
This is how to hold a coup!
so I pay tax to give these people wages? wtf
John smith is lovin it
4:22...Shit got real.
6:30 welcome to Handforth🤣
I’d love to know how these people are feeling now it’s gone viral, I hope they see the funny side of it all. 😂
It's like the directors cut of the Vicar of Dibly
Is this the only episode? I can't find the previous on Netflix.
Welcome to En-gland's little empire...
@0:11 "F**k off" Great start!
The guys who are left are clearly butt kissing!
John helped this meeting a lot. By the end people were laughing and joking unlike the beginning when it was a joke lol
If a young writer submitted this for a radio-4 comedy, it would be rejected out of hand by the producers for being utterly unrealistic.  How often fact is stranger than fiction!
"You have no power here Jackie the Grey" LOTR The Handford Parish Edition
Comedy gold. I hope the BBC commission a series soon 🤣
Surely this isn't real...
Like Tarzan they are all banging there Egos
When Gollum joins the call at 5:50
It’s like the Hot Fuzz Neighbourhood Watch Alliance has come to life 😂
What the fuck is going on here 😂😂
This shall be put in the archives to look upon in years to come with the title 'Britain in the Covid-19 Lockdown, 2020'
It's quite clear how Councils end up being just a cash cow for the government, they just can't seem to achieve anything else.
This is perfectly cut, the random laughing and shouting is incredible
The Monitoring Officer will decide your fate.  I -am- the Monitoring Officer!
Insane people from a little insignificant place in south Manchester. No wonder local issues take years to resolve when you have dinosaurs like this
First Zoom EVER that I haven't wanted to leave.
Jackie sounds proper Common Purpose trained.
God damn if this doesn’t make you feel proud to be British. Hahahaha.
Comedy Gold this! 🤣🤣🤣 Jackie Weaver
Cyn was a right Grass
Sue playing the long game. Mark my words... This woman will be mayor.
Crazy oaps and Skitzo humans in councils everywhere! Thanks for screwing up everything YOUVE ever touched or talked about.....
"I TAKE CHARGE!" "Do you feel in charge?"
Hilarious!  That has perked up my day 👍
The Clerk, didn't attend the last four meetings. The fact that there were no meetings, is irrelevant.  Deary me....
Better then watching Coronation Street. Love It🤣😂🤣😂🤣
It worries me that this is what happens at all Parish Council meetings. Total chaos and no structure to the meeting. Was there no agenda or minutes of the last meeting to go through?
Best thing the League of Gentlemen have ever done... oh this is real?
This looks much more fun than my labour party meetings!
Jackie weaver is 2021 version of Carol Baskin
People in a meeting discussing nothing but the meeting.
I'm glad I don't have a planning application in to Handforth Parish Council. It could be some time before they get around to discussing it!
God, this just typifies bureaucracy, doesn’t it. Whole lot of waffle with no action whatsoever.
Jesus Christ no wonder it takes councils 10 years to fill in a pothole and why it costs them millions of £s to do things it would cost someone normally a few thousand. Bunch of idiots
READ THE STANDING ORDERS
This is totally appalling behaviour. So unprofessional.
Boomers trying to operating technology. Hilarious.  #TheBrexitGeneration
You can hear the moment he stops being Smeagol and goes full Gollum at 5:50
All we need is Malcolm Tucker to start spinning local politics and this sequel the The Thick of It will be perfect.
5:48 Gollum joins the meeting.
If Jackie says “urm” once more I can’t carry on watching this hilarious video.
The new tarentino movie.
Why almost all members of  councils, scrutiny panels are old gits? Where are young people?
If this goes viral...  Took a couple of months, hold onto your hats ladies and gentlemen.
YOU'RE MUTED IAN
In a local parish council meeting they spent 45 minutes talking about sausage rolls. That and this is why I will never get involved with such things. Endless wittering about absolutely nothing plus a large helping of self importance.
Team Jackie!
What I want to know is how the chair and vice chair got elected in the first place 😬
Is this real?! It just can't be.
English people: Why do the rest of the UK make fun of us, we’re the same as everyone else!  Also English people:
Is it real? Is it really real? 🤣
The Exorcist turned up at 6 mins and told someone we’re trying to have a meeting
17:01 "You know me, i'm not usually lost for words" ..Says the amiable volunteer lady who averages around four "um" s per sentence.
Bunch of geriatrics trying to come to terms with the 21th century
I thought Roger Small's seat was the top of his head at first n was like damn he is pretty small
At 0.10 sec does anyone else hear what I think I hear :)
Haha loved it. 😂
Well it’s gone viral... has the war of words and the turf war broken out 🤣
-You have no power here Jackie weaver!    - I will draw you chairman as poison is drawn from a wound!
Typical bureaucratic committee bullshit with people full of their own self importance  who couldn’t run a bath......what idiots!........we sure this wasn’t a script written by Alan Ayckbourn😀
No wonder nothing gets done and this country is going down the toilet with people like this!
The Alliance of the Chairman, Aled and Barry will be back, Jackie. You haven’t heard the end of this.
I enjoyed it immensely, the roles are superbly cast but I would suggest more indignation at the next meeting...oh and a song or two from the guitar player.
Was that Gollum at 5:50? 😂😂😂😂😂
Looking forward to the Independent article on this one.
"we dont want a turf war going on here" - Im gone lol
6:00 is by far the best bit. We're trying to have a teams meeting you fool! Followed by creepy laughter. Classic
midsummer murders 🤣🤣
5:48 Gollum: We're trying to have a teams meeting you fool!
Can’t wait for the musical- Barry wasn’t in the zoom where it happened 🎼 zoom where happened 🎼
Jackie Weaver - Legend  Sue - mastermind Aled - confused  Cyn - refers to everyone by full name at all times  John Smith - Top Bombing Peter Moore - Guitar Lad Ian Ball - loves a fleece Roger Small - yes please  Alan's Ipad - odd surname
I imagine this to be like a cabinet meeting although much more organised
Having Handforth PC Clerk as your Zoom monikor?!  “I CAST THEE OUT!”
John Smith’s deadbeat delivery is brilliant. Welcome to Handforth after all that carry on 😂
Good of Alan to allow Pat Jennings hair attend the meeting
lol I live in Handforth, this is absolute gold
Where did Gollum come from at 5.40 !?
WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE A TEAMS MEETING YOU FOOL
Surely Jackie Weaver/Britney Spears is Mrs Cropley from The Vicar of Dibley? There is a chocolate & taramasalata cake somewhere in that room!
How did zey ever win the war?
Jackie Weaver is the icon we need in these dark times.
That Jackie Weaver is a right bossy sausage!! 😂
17:00 bad move...
Anyone notice right at the beginning when your man says when do we plan to start someone whispers "fuck off" this is chaos
This is just sensational viewing all round. A perfect microcosm of English society
Concerns expressed about this going viral on the Internet.  "No we don't want to start a turf war". 😂
The subtitles appear to have renamed,appropriately, from Handforth to Handful...So far, this has made my day...especially the comments 😁🤣😂🤣
"He's NOT the Parish Council Clerk,  he's a very naughty boy ! " https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBbuUWw30N8
I served 4 years as a town/parish councillor, I can assure people that this is pretty tame stuff compared to some meetings I participated in....If only we had filmed them?
Beautiful. A great cultural, anthropological and comedic artefact. Historians will marvel in wonder.
Can somebody make some badges with "I'M THE CLERK OF THE PARISH COUNCIL" on them?  I'd buy the fuck out of one.
Can one of you Brits ask the Queen if she can send Jackie Weaver to Canada to fix our politics? Shouldn't take her more than a few minutes.
The chairman of the council is the erm, er, hum, chairman of the council! What a bunch of cocks! We actually vote these fruitcakes in 🤪
Old useless duffers like this all over England, supposedly representing their local area, is it any wonder why people have little or no faith in not only local politics but the government structure itself! Totally embarrassing and shameful, glad I don't reside in the parish council area!
16:12 david definitely leaked it
Roger Smallminded.
I propose a motion that this video be trimmed to five minutes
This third series of Succession isn’t what I was expecting.
Absolutely hilarious. Sounds funnier still played at 2x speed.
I’m so confused by what is happening, but all I do know is that this is a bunch of angry, bored gammons, arguing about rules they’ve made up 😂
Did I hear a “fuck off” at the first few seconds in??😂😂
Now to await the film adaptation starring the who's who of British actors! Starring :Dame Judy Dench, Maggie Smith, Imelda Staunton, Michael Gambon, Billy Connelly, David Tennant etc etc 😂
Hilarious
Shout out to the Hartke amplifier
Wait, so people actually talk and behave like this. No wonder shit takes so long to get done.😂
Has @Lubalin seen this?  This is A1 song inspiration, surely?
Jackie should run the council on her own...they'd get a lot more done 😂
Whatever authority Jackie did or did not have, the call went a lot easier once she kicked the assholes out of the meeting 😆
Can't wait to see the live action version of this
This video is the greatest evidence to bust the myth that older demographics can't use the latest technology.
I need to see January’s meeting and fast
The not so funny side is, this lot and all parish councils add a cost to everyones council tax.
I swear I've seen some of these people in my local waitrose. TURF WAR
This is the most extraordinary extraordinary meeting I have ever seen. Amaze.
Give Jackie a medal!
Poor Jackie Weaver. What a horrid bunch of people.
Jackie, please get in touch. I’d hire you for any job. You’re a legend.  Let’s hope the rude aggressive people on this call are no longer part of this local council.
Where's the chairman gone? You mean chairman of the board? ' Just give me a little more time' now that was was a great song.
Looking forward to the next meeting
Karen wins!
Handforth Parish Council, you'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
“Subcommittee of the steering group”. No wonder developers absolutely rinse these people.
Jackie should have said "run your own f______ meeting!"
A war with words
This has to be a wind-up. Surely this can't be real
As far as is known, we get one shot at existence and this is how they choose to use and spend it. They all deserve that unspoken circle of Dante's hell and each other's company. A homeless crack addict's chaos would be a preferable choice of existence for me.
The UK is such a meme
Turns out Jackie did have the authority
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE JACKIE WEAVER
The shouty vice chairman is most definitely due a Rorschach test, some of the best comedic moments ive ever come across, a cross between The Thick of It, W1A, Young Ones and Father Ted, DRINK!!!!!!
What a bunch of incompetent Karens.
Discord mods be like:
So THIS is what goes on behind closed curtains! God help us 😱😱
love the interplay between aled and his dad (I presume). When Jackie kicks out the chair his dad is like "don't, don't, don't". And I love aleds smug smirk after he says "illegally". Aled is definitely the "fuck off" guy at the start. Also love Jackie's pause to compose herself after kicking the Chair. So many highlights
classic sitcom
What a bunch of miserable old bastards. Jackie, we salute you.
Can we make this recordinh available?  Queu Curb your Enthusiasm music
I swear I thought I was watching a Benny Hill episode.
If only Ronnie Pickering had been there to sort them out...
We need this to be a reality show :-)
"I've never seen such a strongly worded letter."
Jackie Weaver looks like Claudia from the Americans
Jesus Christ lol.
Enjoyed when Gollum turned up @ 5:45
This has made my day.  Hilarious ..... I particularly liked jackies comment “I did see the monicker “
What would happen if Jackie Weaver and Ronnie Pickering ever met?
Jackie Weaver is the British Leslie Knope
Comedy gold.
Mace Windu: “the senate will decide your fate”  Jackie Weaver: “I AM THE SENATE”
I heard there was a French general who said that committees should have an odd number of people and three is too many.
"He did not attend any of the meetings. The fact that there were no meetings is irrelevant" 13.34 Love it!! Dad's Army.
MAKE BLIGHTY GREAT AGAIN.  Jackie Weaver for PM.
Jackie Weaver, ‘Huzzah!’
"YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE, JACKIE WEAVER!"
Not much planning discussion going on here, is there? Is this why planning applications take so long?
Is this some sort of torture?
@4:17  Vice Chair:- NO YOU CAN'T APPOINT A CHAIRMAN. I'M THE VICE CHAIR. I TAKE CHARGE. READ THE STANDING ORDERS!!! READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!!
I don't know what's happening, but I'm looking forward to the Turf war in a tiny parish 😂😂
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE JACKIE WEAVER!
If 2020 was a zoom meeting
@4:05  Chairman:- It's only the chairman who can remove people from a meeting. You have no authority here Jackie Weaver. No authority at all!  Jackie Weaver:- {uses her admin powers as host of the meeting to remove chairman}.
0:10 already telling him to f*** off if you listen closely. Great start
This is absolutely bloody unbelievable.
It's like the Parish council in the Hot Fuzz Movie
Why did Gollum join in at 5:50
Sad and embarrassing , people talking for the sake of talking , i hope these people have no responsibility for the everyday running of this parish council , Chimps T party .
Jackie Weaver mounts a coup against Handforth Parish council. Where's the UN when you need them?
Lol brilliant was needing a good laugh this is defo the highlight of lockdown so far 🤣
A committee of a committee of a sub committees committee
How has nobody mentioned the F off from the PC clerk lol.
Can't wait for season 2 😂
You know when your looking for entertaining weird stuff on the Internet.... This is becoming legendary and trending on Twitter. Its like a soap opera.
We are trying to have a teams meeting you fool
Apparently this has been going on since 2017 😂😂
"When do we plan to start?".......f@#koff! 😂😂😂
“The chairman of the council is the chairman of the council”
Absolute chaos and it’s hilarious.
I have seen more intelligence in a zoo.
The comments under this video are just as funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Set of irresponsible childish bullies and these people are able to make decisions? They should all be put in a barrel and rolled down a big hill.
MRS WEAVER, PLEASE!!!!!!!
“The vice chairman’s here, I’m in charge!” Ashley Peacock is alive and well and living in Cheshire East.
READ EM AND UNDERSTAND EM!!!!!!!!!!!!!
God older people trying to work technology is rough to watch at times 😂.
Boomer Zoomers :P
Sue is the real power here.
All idiots. Fascinating. This would make a wonderful reality tv programme.
Roger Small - all you can see is the top of the chair. Thought he was really small 😂
What the fuck is wrong with literally all of these people
The cut away to the man with his back to camera will get me every time!
Just wow.. perhaps they’ll watch this and realise how silly they are. This video is going viral for all the wrong reasons. It’s funny but sad at the same time.
5:50 Golum has entered the chat  Lmfao
Always amazes me how people can so easily switch in and out of the formality of meeting dialogue.
5:49 Good to see Gollum is alive and well
Lesson to the young. Old age is a serious business! Have fun while you can
When this pandemic is over I'm gonna go to all these meetings as a member of the public and have my two penn'orth,  if that's OK with t'committee. I only live 250 miles away in Kent.
Didn’t attend any meetings,the fact that no meetings were held is irrelevant 😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂
Why is this country such a mess?   <looks at people in positions of power and authority>  Ah, I see.....
It’s hard to tell when things are cut together cos there is just so much chaos in the meeting it seems like one take
Sub committee of the sub committee,of the sub committee.
Jackie Weaver...Britain's version of Carole Baskin
lol why are the men so aggressive?
This is bloody brilliant.
These are typical of the old fashioned, out of date, archaic parish councils, up and down the country. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Who's Alan Murdock please?" "Yes please"
I thought on 11:08 Roger Small’s chair had broken.
"Can we make this recording available?" 😂 If only he'd known …
Whoever did the casting for that show was a genius :)
Power hungry simpletons - every village council is like this 😂
Alan loves the naughty step
Immature and ridiculous
John Smith sees the chance to power grab.
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE JACKIE WEAVER has real gandalf vibes
The term ‘get a life’ comes to mind.
I love my country.
You have no authority here Jackie weaver.....    She's just kicked him out!
This is what’s wrong ,and indicative of  this country,illuminates the idiots that run/interfere with town and village life
Christ. These morons decide if you can have planning permission for buildings.
John Smith bringing the white knight energy... I think he's trying to get laid.
Julie: I’m just in a meeting can I give you a call back when it’s finished?  Narrator: But Julie has no idea what was about to come...
Poor Jackie what horrible people and if ever the council needed changing up this one is it bunch of complete idiot's !!!!Barry's gone 😂😂
5.50 ...the dude is being possessed!!
Welcome to Handforth 🤣🤣🤣
You could easily put oblivion music over this and it wouldn’t be out of place
It’s not Gollum, its Gammon.
Just rewatched:  Jackie ordering everyone to turn off their microphones was definitely a power move. Almost Putin-esque they way she silenced the opposition before shutting them down
Where's the whole thing?
Hilarious.  no wonder nothing ever gets done in this country.
You have no authority here Sauron!!!!!!  Lmfao
Jackie weaver needs to brush up on the law after being voted off the council forthwith
Rule No1 go for a piss before the meeting starts.
The fact that this has gone viral is brilliant. Up there with super Saturday at the London 2012 olympics for great british achievements.
When do we plan to start?  -fuck off  Already a gripping episode
I now realise why Parish councils do not allow filming of their meetings!
The very quiet 'f*ck off' muttered within a few seconds of the meeting beginning... 😂😂😂😂😂
Great reality TV tho 🤣
Glad I'm on a Committe that's nothing like this !  😱 Our Chairman sets a 👍 perfect Zoom Meeting.  And in this Covid-19 times, permits anyone to have a ☕or 🍷 if they so wish, as they all meet up, via their spare room via Zoom !!! 😁
David Pincombe predicted this going viral. Ahead of his time.
I can’t believe that my small Town has gone viral for this reason 😂😂 The funny thing is most people here in Handforth don’t even know these people even exist 😂
'if you distrupt this meeting I will have to remove you from it'  'YOU CANT'  *Jackie removes him from meeting* 😂
We need the Director's Cut
This might be the best thing on the internet
So what happened in the sequel, 2nd Tuesday in January
So funny
Control freaks clash
Monty Python couldn't have done better.
Oh the pomposity of it!!
is this a coup?
Right at the beginning "fuck off" sets the level 🤣🤣🤣
that Alans Ipad, I tell ya, life of the party
5:49 - 6:00 - Gollum  has escaped
I don't understand why councils never seem to get anything done?
What a bunch ..,.
Boris Johnson should sack the lot of you. Absolutely pathetic
Whoever wrote this is a genius. I almost believe these are real peop...
Alan is such a joker, love his entry and quick wit
This is so amazing
We don't want a turf war breaking out f**k me. I'm thinking about the crips and the bloods gangs in LA😂😂😂
You have no power here, Jackie Stormcrow  *Jackie Weaver casts her cloak aside, revealing she has intact ascended to the seat of Jackie The White among the Maia of Middle Earth*   I WILL DRAW YOU IAN'S IPAD AS POISON IS DRAWN FROM A WOUND
if you ever wanted a reason in any argument about how crap local government in the UK is.
Skip to 5:49 for the introduction of a Stoor little Gollum ahahahha "you foool"
"Coming from you in BIRKENHEAD" Take THAT, Cyn.
Free Alan Murdoch
Please someone make these guys their own TV show
"Please can Alan Murdoch be brought back into the meeting"   "Who is Alan Murdoch please?"   "Yes please"  "No, WHO IS ALAN MURDOCH?"
Priceless!
"He is not the clerk of the parish council [he's a very naughty boy]"
First 10 seconds..  "When do we plan to start" "Fuck off" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is pure W1A - you couldn't make it up!! Brilliant!
I was watching this thinking this is a clear example of bullying in Cheshire East..... But little was I to realise it was within its environs as well!!!
😂 this is how the out of touch white privileged run this country 😂 cognitive biases, misogyny, political class colour age and sex ism's rife!  Exact example of how this country is ran!
Cyn is the sort of bellend who always grasses on people
Legend has it the meeting never officially started...
the "silent" f*k off at 0:13 is the best start to any vid i ever saw
They have to go and get their diary's to see what the date would be for the next meeting but they're all sat on computers. Classic.
You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Chairman Jackie Weaver.
You have no authority here Jackie Weaver! 😂✌️
The biggest question of all this is who is the hero and who is the villain ?
What a bunch of twits
So glad they avoided a Handforth parish turf war
this is hilarious
Jackie Weaver should be the new Covid Tsar.
"All for the greater good"- why does this remind me of hot fuzz
No one notice the “fuck off” at the start 🤣
Would have liked more Barry Burkhill to be honest
Love the bloke who turns into Gollum at 5:48
How utterly shameful, why aren't these people so embarrased they resign and never show their faces in public again? I have never seen such incompetence in all my life... So glad I emigrated!
All this, and for what..... to decide where a new poo bin goes.
"the chairman of the council..is the..the..chairman of the council"  powerful point, well made. jackie weaver was shook
Wig
Forget Tarantino’s Jackie Brown, It’s Jackie Weaver for me !
Gollum joins at 5:48
Britney has let herself go a bit😊
*R E A D  T H E M  A N D  U N D E R S T A N D  T H E M*
This is why I love being British lmao.
Pure electrickery
Democracy in action I can’t wait to go to Handforth😂😂😂
"Welcome to Handforth"
when is the next meeting can i get alerts?
The real parish councillors of Handforth
This HAS to be some kind of set up/scripted performance. I refuse to believe this is real. It's like an actual sitcom. Dibley wouldn't even be this funny.
90% of these members ask for the manager
0:06 seconds in and Roger Small; is already doing a dramatic turn to camera
Did they actually resolve anything here? That's got to be one of the least productive zooms I've witnessed.
Netflix have taken this on for two series initially. I've heard they have Helen Mirren attached to the role of Jackie Weaver. Christian Bale for John Smith,
they have achieved absolutely NOTHING.... bit like the EU...    old farts go retire
"Where is chairman"  "Who is Chairman"  "I'll do you one better, Why is Chairman"
This video should be shown in all educational and business environments of how not to behave when using virtual platforms. #disgraceful behaviour.
Did they actually discuss anything
Just two of the many comments to be discussed at the next meeting.  1. What's comical about Birkenhead 2. We're having a team meeting, YOU FOOL! 3. HA HA HA HA HA HA........etc etc
Is it a case here that two hierarchies exist where previously only one existed. The two being one controlled by pre existing rules, and the other controlled by the person who can manipulate the zoom meeting.    The resolution of this would be if the chair knew how zoom worked and he or she was the one to properly chair the meeting, that is a third party should not control who is in the naughty. room.   It may be that the chair had not called a meeting for some time so this is where Janet came in, but she should not be the decider of who is banned from a meeting or not, this was the main contention of those banned from the last meeting.      Regardless did they actually talk about anything of any usefulness to the community.
To me to you!!! To me to you!! Chuckle Brothers 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
0:11 ‘f*ck off”
There needs to be a Gandalf V Galadriel parody here lol ‘you have no power here!!!!’ 😂😂😂
Firstly, why are all the councillors really old? Need some youngish brains in there to get things done. These old gits couldn't organise a piss up in a brewery. What an ambarrassment and not to mention a bunch of A holes. Literally.
How many billions of pounds does this kind of shambles cost the British Taxpayer a year ?   we need new and  better Gov and Councils... ASAP.  imo
5:50 : Gollum has entered the call
"no, no, no, no, no, yes, we are the council"
You have no authority jackie  Jackie “kicks him out”   Read them and understand them!!!!! 😂
What in the Netflix drama🍿🍷😳▶️ 🤣
This is top viewing. On a serious note and I say this as a PC chairman of 21 years. Unfortunately this is a scene that can be seen all round our beautiful Isle. The bureaucracy that has crept in over the years means that meeting have about 5 minutes to discuss and administer the wellbeing of the parishioners which what it's meant to be all about.
FFS 🤪🤪🤪
Where has the chairman Gone? Lol
Appalling behaviour, good luck Brittany! Been there and got the t-shirt 😢
And to think...these clowns are paid out of the public purse ...dear god 🤦🏻‍♂️
Just got to the bit where they discuss the video going viral and how bad it would be  Ooops.
They're all stars. God blessem evry wun.
"The chairman of the Council is the chairman of the ..... Council" amazing
Business as usual.
Poor Sue
Jackie Weaver is Cleopatra
You could tell the Chair and Jackie had pure underlying beef and he pushed her too far.  I think he'd been ruling the HPC with an iron fist
Councilors getting yeeted quicker than a twitter tr4nsphobe
A very good example of bullying in Cheshire East...and it's environs
Boomer TV!
Were trying to have a teams meeting you FOOL
The chairman should have been the primary Brexit negotiator.
Put yer hand down now peter
Jackie for PM
The initial whispered "f*ck off" is the best opening to a movie since the boot slam in Goodfellas.
"terf war"
Read them and UNDASTAND EM!!!
Who is Alan Murdock please? Yes please.  No, who is Alan Murdock?  Absolute fucking GOLD   ^ BTW this is everything wrong with England today, they 100% vote Tory and 100% voted for Brexit.
A bunch of power hungry old men with ancient views of the role of women. Utterly disrespectful and disgusting.
I can hardly wait for common law.
Cannot wait for next weeks episode, this is so gripping 🤣
Aleds Bruton's dad/grandpa is a pure Chaotic Evil
And now we know why the councils always seem to take forever to get things sorted. Too busy arguing amongst themselves 🤣
grumpy old men drunk with the great power of the Handforth Parish Council 😂
We spent the first 5 mins debating who the bad guy was. My partner thought it was a real plot twist but I saw it coming a mile off! Better writing needed.
THE GREATER GOOD
Jackie: I've never seen such a strongly worded letter from a voluntary officer John: You've not been to Handforth enough  Johns accustomed to the Ghetto life
Pure comedy gold. Brilliant.
David Brent vibes 😂😂 love it
When is the next episode coming out? Best comedy I’ve seen in ages!
One of the best things I've ever ever seen
We don’t want a turf war breaking out!!😂
Can we make this recording available????   Did he actually mean make it available to the entire world?
What a waste of time....absolutely nothing gets done.
Women
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!! 😂 😂
Everyone’s talking about Jackie, but Sue is the real mastermind behind this plot
The "welcome to handforth" joke...the silence is wonderful
Let's create a subcommittee for the steering group...   Honestly, people. Grab a shovel you'd get more done.
All dead now. Breaks your heart.
Angry little men
Remember who your councillors are when you vote next time.......this happens all over the country
" the chairman of the council is the chairman of...the council"
Parish Councils are made up of busybodies, usually retired. I had to attend several meetings due to my old job and the nature of it and constant complaints from the 'Parish Council'. They are embarrassing as grown adults squabble like kids
The "Fuck Off" at 0:10 set the tone for the whole video!!! I knew I was in for a treat!! Hahahahahaha
Alan's iPad is my Spirit animal
You fooool
They ought to take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week, but all the decisions of that officer have to be ratified at a special bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs, but by a two-thirds majority in the case of purely external affairs.
I want the footage from the previous meeting where they were both kicked out as well
The way those 3 are culled at beginning is very Game of Thrones. When do the dragons arrive?
Please! Never, ever take down this video. It's an ammmmmmmmmmazing piece of British history
Alan really wants to be on the council. Just waiting for one of them to 'pop their clogs'...
Yer man gets so angry @ 5:48 he temporarily gets posesed by Pazuzu
What  a. Lot  of old tripe if you find this funny well, I feel sorry for you! ,
The Parish meetings of the Vicar of Dibley are more concise than this ... haha !
You're muted Ian!
Is this an extract from the sequel to Hot Fuzz?
'The Clark's attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed. BUT MY RESOLVE HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER!' -Jackie Weaver
My favourite is Alan being muted all the way through the chaos until they all finally realise he was even in the meeting 😂
Coming 2021.... Episode 3: The Return of The Chairman. The former fellowship members prepare for the final battle
England the biggest shit show in the world 😂😂😂
They're posh in Handforth, apparently
The video being 240p in the year of our lord 2021 really brings it all together
Perhaps Jackie Weaver could circle back
welcome to the uk
I feel sorry for the residents of Handforth.
Shot being fired from every angle for 18 straight minutes 😭😭😭
Just to be clear Jackie Weaver has no authority here. None at all!
I want to be part of the next zoom meeting for Handforth Parish Council 😂😂
this is amazing
"A sub committee of the steering group: is that... ideal?"
Some absolutely vile personalities in this 🤣  Good luck getting your potholes fixed with this going on behind the scenes.
And we sat here paying our tax to the council wondering why nothing gets done.... you know what they say if you can’t be successful in life become a councillor
A bunch of crusty old busy-bodies and tech-incompetent boomers having a bloviating contest in their little imaginary kingdom, wa*king off on the faux authority they think they have. I don't give a toss about some technical point in some dusty old rule book that was probably written in Victorian times - just talk about the important stuff that local residents want you to deal with, as equals and as grown-ups. What a bunch of childish, ineffective tossers!
Little England’s at their finest !!
Fabulous! Can we please have the vid of the meeting that was to be held on ".. the second Tuesday of January..." 😂.
At 12 seconds does anyone hear the F word....
"In 25 years I have never seen such a strongly worded letter from a monitoring officer to a parish council." "You've obviously not spent enough time in Handforth!"
The audible gasp at 4:25 is such an underrated part of the video
This is just SO Cheshire!
FirkinL that was boring!
2:15 will you STOP TALKING
Abysmal.
With jobsworth, jumped up idiots, like these clowns, is it any wonder why everything in this country takes for ever to get sorted.
Jackie Weaver for PM
A. It appears that the entire raison d'etre of this group is to learn and abide by its own bureaucracy.  B. This is incredibly reminiscent of scenes in the British parliament.
Send them a message!
This is the sort of thing I expect to be the lead off for a Midsomer Murders episode!
A bunch of old people doing their hardest to be relevant in the world.
Let's all get the vaccine so that we can pay good money to attend a Handforth Parish Council meeting for real.
So proud to be old, legends.
Jackie Weaver, a nominee for woman's personality of the year 2021. Hold your own girl
And these people make decisions. Tea or coffee, milk and sugar? should be the limit of their involvement
Jackie Weaver <3
Putting Cheshire on the map
Classic British comedy at its best
I shouldn't have enjoyed this so much
They’re like children in a playground...
I hate every single one of these people but I cannot stop watching   :o
She's obviously on a power trip. Nothing else of meaning in her life so she conducts petty bullying online.
11 seconds in, does someone say F off?! 🧐 what a start 😂
"You have no authority here, Jackie Weaver!"  Jackie Weaver: "Execute Order 66"
The chaos this exudes.
#CountyLines #ParishFam
Boomers......
Great work Sue, Cyn , Ian and Jackie , Peter democracy in action..
Sue has a very powerful voice  MAY I INTERJECTTTTT
Jackie Weaver for PM
We knew there would be trouble from the very beginning - “When do we plan to start?”  *whispers* “F*ck off* 😂😂
14:32
This needs to appear on Gogglebox 😂
John Smith “the fact there were no meeting held is irrelevant” GOLD
When does the next installment come out?!
This is a brilliant comedy sketch
Is there a video of the second Tuesday in January?
What a shambles. I hope this is edited, because otherwise, absolutely NOTHING was achieved. Everyone seems to think they know procedure, when it seems none of them do. Ms Weaver’s role/status/reason for presence is never stated. If these zoom meetings are to continue, some basic training is required. One at once, allow for net delay, someONE has to take control. No asides, understand everyone can hear.  It shows what happens if you let ppl be ‘democratic’ — everyone understands something different by it and that they are correct. A joke show indeed, pure ‘The Thick of It’. Funny, but not good if these folk are given any executive/financial authority.
"You're muted Ian... You're muted!" "Severe lag on the system"
“You have NO POWER HERE!!!, Gandalf stone crow!!!!!!!!!!!”
Julie's I pad
At the end, when they were debating whether to make the meeting public. "I don't see why not..." Famous last words...😂😂😂
Sue suddenly appearing to bark a polite request is very funny
Fucking Jackie Weaver
English brexiteers on smack.
Symptomatic of local politics all over. Same personalities here.
is this real?!?! Hahahahaha! does this council ever get things done? I've seen a troop of gorillas  behave with more grace and decorum
Jackie doesn’t know what she’s talking about
TURF WAR! 🔥🔥
Proof that Brexit was needed so the Brits can take control and run their country better......
Why didn’t anyone shout “I’m Spartacus”  ... ? ..
This has to be staged, brilliant actors! :D
Worrying that these folk represent people. Embarrassing 🙈
big League of Gentlemen vibes
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY JACKIE
Its so middle class Cheshire, I love it 🤣
Hooligans 🤣🤣  “When is the second Tuesday in January?” Me shouting; THERES A CALENDAR ON YOUR COMPUTER!!! 🤪🤪
Love that Gollum made an appearance at 05:47
My favourite;  "Who's Alan Murdoch please?"  "Yes please."
I stan Jackie Weaver tbh.
When Vicar of Dibley goes bad.....
Good grief! The whole PC needs throwing out! How childish!
This is what Sir Humphrey Appleby referred to as the dunghill of local government.
Greatest Country on Earth 🇬🇧 FOR THE QUEEN 🇬🇧
I think that parish councils may now become vastly more popular
Alan's ipad toured with The Stones in the 60's
I live in a little village. We have 5 parish councillors. I wonder if their meetings are anything like this 😂 the vice chairman reminded me of Derek Hatton. And as for Jackie Weaver, words fail me. The power wielded by the host of a Zoom meeting is demonstrated well here. Choosing who to admit and eject from the meeting without reference to anyone else. It wouldn't happen if they were in the same room for a conventional meeting.
Who's alan Murdoch? Yes please 😂😂 this is comedy gold
This is actually more entertaining than some modern blockbusters I’ve watched recently
On the surface it's hilarious.  It then dawns that such incompetent, dysfunctional people are actually in decision making positions of responsibility; terrifying.  If you want to make a nobody think they are a somebody, give them a position in local government.  Job done. 👍
If this was scripted and on the BBC it would win awards, its made my day :)
Brilliant show.  When't s the next episode?  Do you sell merch?  I want the 'Jackie Weaver Has No Authority Here' doormat.
“You have no authority here” *is kicked out*  Best plot twist since Fight Club.
Petition for all Handforth Council meetings to be live-streamed from now onwards?? All in favour say “You have no authority here Jackie Weaver!!”
I need to see that strongly worded letter Jackie Weaver!
Is this legit? Classic comedy.
Ok let’s play councils , yes I’m in charge , no I’m in charge , NO IM IN CHARGE , I’m in charge , let’s just all argue about who’s in charge , and if you don’t we don’t like anything that’s said , just try to sound clever ok and the weaver woman must be one of the most annoying people , she should just leave and gets job at McDonald’s cleaning or a similar role , all of them seem to have lost the way , there position is to look after the people whos area they cover , not some way to make them feel important, because they aren’t and never will have the intelligence, just sad lonely people I’m afraid
No talent + inflated sense of importance + a smattering of Brexit = Handforth PC
They need to get out more!! Oh right they can't 😂🤣
Heading for a turf war in Handforth, put the guns down people!
"the law has been broken"
“Can we make this recording available, of the Zoom meeting?” and thus the fourth wall was broken
7 minutes in, has the meeting actually started? The Chair and the Deputy have been thrown out, there's no agenda, there's matters being raised that are neither from the agenda nor the notes of a previous meeting, a chair has taken over without being elected. This is pure comedy gold.
Handforth PC clerk is a weapon of a man
I adore it
If the retirement age were increased to 75 it would stop all this nonsense.
It's like Trumpton on crack.
So many great phrases in this   Welcome to Handforth
Jackie Weaver 'Stopped the Count'.
Did they actually get any work done? This is hilarious. So very typical.
Wtf sue .. trying to throw the cat amongst the parish pigeons..
The police were called later after an altercation with the Handforth Townswomens Guild Knitting Society turned violent....
So what was the point of that meeting? What did they actually get done? No wonder people think local government is just there to line politicians pockets
David Pincombe out here at 16.20 predicting the future
Bit like Westminster. 🤣😂
Was any business actually done?
So British 😭
Funniest meeting EVER 😂! A meeting to set up a sub committee of the steering group!
These guys are acting right? Brilliant performances! So real
Does someone say "'F*** off..." at 0:10 ?
Make Handfoth Great again.
The Japanes Olympic chairman who said women talk to much in meetings must have had this in mind.   Brilliant
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!!
Who needs Netflix 😂  You’ve gotta love real life.
Now I understand why the local authorities can't so much as fill a pothole in.
Jackie Weaver has been moved to a safe house since this meeting.
”You have no authority here, Jackie Weaver, none at all!”  Boss Level: 11/10
"Who is Jackie Weaver?"    "HUHHHH"
Check out the letter at the bottom of the page for the Director of Governance’s take. https://www.handforth.org.uk/index.php
Welcome to Hanforth
You have no authority here Jackie weaver
Does anyone think Peter Moore likes guitars?
Good to see Ronnie Pickering turning up on Alex's iPad at 4.18.
Here comes the subpoeeenaaaa!
"...he is being very disrespectful"  "Coming from you, from Birkenhead, thats good!"
No wonder my application 15 flats on half an acre of land with one parking space got turned down.
Alan is a certified Chad
Hahahaha! ...What a bunch of pompous, self important old farts!
5.51 the possessed 😂
Never been more proud to be British.
And there's the back of the tshirt
"She's kicked him out!"
You can see why nothing ever gets done 😂
Lapping hyaena😂
Well it keeps them off the streets at night
F- me Al, get those clippers on and sort out that barnet!
The Thick of It - Rise of the Village Idiots!
Ian, you're muted
Please release the meetings before this and give the proceeds to charity, you'd raise a fortune!
This is the best thing I have ever seen.
Space x team ???
This is just incredible.
I was just waiting for Eric Cartman to join in. “YOU WILL RESPECT MY AUTHORITAH!!”
Sue is loving this.
Jackyyyyyyyyyy😂
Aled ... I hope his mummy and daddy are proud of him and his disgraceful behaviour. A complete spoilt man-child.  I’m so glad my meetings are not like this, I don’t think I could cope 😳😂😂
This is better than "staged" we dont need David Tennant  and Michael Sheen now lol
"Coming from you from Birkenhead, that sounds good"
A 10-part Netflix investigative documentary series about this Handforth parish council meeting immediately pls. It would make Tiger King look like Heartbeat. We need this as a society.
It’s the cut to silence and fiery lighting as Barry Burkhill faces away from the screen for me
Oh this is brilliant and so well edited. Very very funny.
So to sum up...
"Well...... welcome to Hanforth"   The Thick of It eat your heart out, this is GOLD
whos the chairman of the council??? lol lol lol
RULE BRITANNIA 🇬🇧
Check out the prequel in the description too.  Just as good.
This has got midsummer murders written all over it!
Pettifogging Tammany Hall hucksters...
Fantastic British diplomacy at its best.
The clerk has no power to remove anyone from a meeting and no clue of what she is doing. As chair I would sack her the next day
This is the BEST thing I’ve seen in a long time. “READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!” 😂
So needed this today ☝️😊 hilarious 🤣💕
Can we have all future meetings shown live on BBC One please? Assuming there is no bidding war for the rights that is.
HIGHLIGHTS.....  00:06 - When do we plan to start?.........Fuck off. 01:30 - Asthmatic Tarzan 02:23 - Will you stop being whatever it is you're trying to be! 03:02 - Julie's Tinder date calls 03:17 - Barry waits for the moment to turn around in his chair, stroking a fluffy white cat 03:57 - You have no authority Jackie Weaver! 04:03 - Overlord Weaver demonstrates the power of this fully armed and operational battlestation. 04:18 - I TAKE CHARGE!

If this was a video game these are the boss boomers you see on the last level
Peak Zoom. Just delete the app, we can't top this
@5:09 “the chairman of the council.. is the chairman of the...council”
Ian...Ian you're muted
Is that Gollum entering the meeting at 5:47?
It’s like Faulty Towers in the old people’s home, full of naughty cranky people. A combination of oldies who don’t have a clue about technology, coupled with pompous self important culture. Welcome to Britain.... 😂😂😂
@0:11 "fuck off"
Fucking scary that these people play a role in housing
I can not wait to see this animated! :D
Great Gollum impression at 05:45!
The funniest thing is they thought releasing the video was a good idea. It makes them all look like petty idiots. It is the best advert for banning Parish Councils and insisting on qualifications for local Councillors.
Holy shit who knew small council power politics was this juicy?
Well Done Jackie Weaver and John Smith.
If you're British, this is pure Gold 😂
Jackie Weaver... classy, bougie, Ratchet...
This is the best thing on you tube.
This is one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen
Is it me or can someone be heard saying 'F*** off' after the chairman says 'When do we plan to start?' Around 0:08.
"We don't wanna start a turf war"
The way forward is that YouTube commenters reach out to HPC, and form a Steering Committee to the Subcommittee for Zoom Administrative Affairs to the Handforth Parish Council. To be directed by 'aOsm' All in favour?
Are we not going to mention Aled’s IPad going full Gollum at 6:02
This is the most British thing ever 😂 , “For the greater good ?“ “for the greater good”
Illegally
Parish councillors all have annover inflated sense of their own importance. Doesn't suprise me that this is in Cheshire East the whole place is clowns-ville 🤣🤣
This is comedy Gold 🤣 😂 😆
this might be the best thing ive ever seen
this is the funniest shit I have ever seen on YT
Wow! Jackie Weaver makes Stalin look like fluffy kitten!
Today Handforth, tomorrow the World!
They don’t actually get anything done at all....do they ever!
John Smith..."He hasn't attended a meeting for 6 months. The fact that there hasn't been any meetings is irrelevant."
Vicar of Dibley energy
John the time has come   Execute order 66.
This is one of those things where you notice something different each time. Yes, I've watched it multiple times. Yes, it's gets better with each watch.
Jackie needs to go
I love that Peter raises his hand to speak.
a bunch of silly old fools who have nothing to do but loads of free time to do it in, playing with technology they have no idea how to work. please please please tell me they don't get paid for any of this
I would say that the reason these meetings might descend into this manner of chaos and aggression is that they're conducted remotely. I feel that these people wouldn't be half as rude to each other if they were in the room together.
Well David Pincombe correctly predicted this would go viral.
The British Parks and Recreation is coming along nicely I see!
One does not simply declare themselves clark
Thank you for this on behalf of all the gays. We love the drama.
Brilliant stuff - love Netflix - can't wait for season 2!
“You’re muted”....the soundtrack to the pandemic 😷🤣
Why does that one guy off camera sound like Gollum 😂😂😂
When boomers use Zoom.
"He never attended any meetings for three months. The fact that were not any meetings is irrelevant". 🤔
I am totally with Peter Moore on all the points he makes.
Clap for Jackie Weaver tonight 7pm
Is this Dunny on the Wold? Jackie Weaver, the acting returning officer stood in after the predecessor accidentally brutally cut his own head off whilst combing his hair
Why is every one of these people so much?
These people are an absolute embarrassment. I would disown these cretins if they were my family.
Comedy gold 🤣
The CHAIRMAN of the meeting was kicked out after only 5 mins! WOW!
"You are on this council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master" - Mace Windu
Wow the Vice Chair was a great cameo!
"One of the councilors from the west ward, did not attend the meeting for the last 6 months. The last meeting they attend was November last year. So missed, December, January, February, April and March, which was the last HPC meeting. The fact there was no meetings held is irrelevant. "
These people are a WiFi glitch away from a machine gun rampage.
What a bunch of half wits
JUSTICE FOR BARRY!
'When do we plan to start......' F*ck off!
Such tempers its terrible behaviour by all concerned
THEY BLOCKED THEIR ACCESS!!!!
Jackie's gone power mad
Americans have Karen's, we have Jackie's.
Just full of old men thinking they’re all high and mighty🤢
I need an opening credits with the song 'village green preservation society' playing
Team Alan's iPad!
We have John Smith to thanks for the upcoming years worth of memes.
Handforth PC Clerk: "It's only the chairman who can remove people from the meeting. You have no authority here Jackie Weaver!"  Jackie Weaver: "OK BOOMER"
Reminds me of Staged..... And why is it full of oldies?
READ THE STANDING ORDERS
If it opened and closed with credits I'd think I'd watched an Alan Bennett piece.
This why I love England but live in Los Angeles.
Could you upload the whole thing, rather than "best of" so we can see it all. I'd love to see an archive so I can see things develop over time into this mess!
Best thing I have seen on the internet 🤣🤣🤣🤣 vicar of Dibley comes to mind!
'You have no authority here Jackie Weaver' - said Malcolm Tucker to Nicholas Nickleson😂
5:30 'ere comes the sdfhghdfg PEENAAA
I love Great Britain
this is pure GOLD!
This is the greatest thing I have ever seen. David doesn’t say anything for the entire meeting and comes out of nowhere predicting this will go viral. And then Jackie comes out with “PLEASE REFER TO ME AS BRITNEY SPEARS FROM NOW ON”
This is a masterpiece. Jackie should be the new Speaker in the house of commons.
And these are the types of meetings where YOUR planning applications are decided....... you know the ones that cost you a small fortune! Clowns!!!
What a bunch of walley’s
Classic Middle England (ism) and "one-upmanship' / hierarchal nonsense at its best. These committees run the breadth of the british empire - providing the perfect platform to inflate their own ego and pathetic agendas. Both tragic and hilarious at the same time. God help us.
When you phone up to see how your planning permission is going at the council ? There’s a power grab going on, we haven’t got time for this 😂😂😂
Nice to see Smeagul making an appearence at the parish council.. 5:48
Isn't this typical of any group, council or whatever, who spend more time discussing points of order and procedural issues than actually doing any work. And the ones who are most self-proud aren't those who have changed people's lives for the better and served their community, but the ones who known the rules inside out and proudly pull people up for minor breaches.
More drama and content than Season 8 of Game of Thrones.🤣
Alan's iPad was the wildcard we needed
Julie's I pad  Christ.
The person on Aled's zoom - "I'm the deputy chairman, I'm in charge!!!!!!" Sheer comedy gold. 😂😂😂😂😂
Of course there has to be someone called 'John Smith'. You wouldn't make it up for fear of being too stereotypical
This is better than watching a tv soap 🧼
This made my day. Entirely. 💯
It's like a load of misbehaved squabbling children. Can they do the next meeting in Haribo voices please. 🤣
This is almost the perfect am-dram farce. I’m only half way through and cannot wait for the final scene.
15:20 "just glad it's a Zoom meeting"  So are we
Comedy gold.
Lol if they don't want her controlling the meeting why do they make her the Zoom host.
"We don't want a turf war breaking out."  Oh, it's far too late for that now "Mr. Chairman"....
We need a sequel to this
This has to be a spoof, right?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
A wild Gollum appearing is my absolute favourite moment
Holy fuck justin pulliam would be soo happy
This is how I imagine the HOA
Over privileged boomers...haha
Reminds me of a ‘carry on’ sketch. Good entertainment
If only Croft and Perry were still alive to write the series.
WILL YOU STOP TALKING 😤😤😤😤
This reminds me of Donald Trump's attempted coup last month
Gammontastic!
I'm really digging this reboot of The Thick of It
boomers
perfect example of politicians achieving fuck all....
this is the office
cant wait till the real meeting at the office when the lock downs over lol.
Regime change. Take note CIA. This is how it’s done at a parish level
This is better than the house of cards. Netflix, please green light a 2nd episode
Someone please tell me this is a pilot for a new series. I am already invested and ready to binge the whole thing.
I do trust they have previously made a decision to put a visible defibrillator in a prominent position in Handforth!🤣
Vicar of Dibley the Covid Years
The last meeting never ended for the chairman, he came with a vengeance
These are the individuals making important decisions for their community? It’s like a comedy sketch without the comedy!!!
I mean, this is glorious on so many levels, it hath utterly MADE my Friday arvo.
Thanks Steve for posting this, egads this meeting makes me want to change gender to avoid embarrassment.
5:50 we’re trying to have a teams meeting previous, we’re trying to have a teams meeting PRECIOUS
Beyond amazing !
I can't tell if this is real 😂
This is unbelievable 😂😂
“It’s only the chairman who can remove people from the meeting! You have no authority Jackie Weaver, no authority at all!”  Jackie Weaver: *ZOINK*
There's definitely some wife swapping going on behind the scenes.
I’m struggling to decide whose side I’m on. Is Jackie good or evil? Was this a coup? Did she save the democracy by crushing a dangerous insurrection?  So much intrigue.
I love watching boomers try and use technology.  There's just something satisfying about seeing them struggle at something for a change, as opposed to seeing younger people struggle to start their lives.
Utterly brilliant.
0:06 “When do we plan to start?” “Fack off!”
“Now they will elect a new chairman. A strong chairman.”
Classic episode of Handforth Parish Council
SUBPOENA!
Julie sounds like a bit of a minx!
John smith : 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Like the Vicar of Dibley on meth
Mrs Doubtfire Channeling Jackie Weaver ??
Winnie The Pooh deserves respect and honor
Which theatre company are performing this?  Are they currently touring?
5:50 is like when Gollum talks to himself in lord of the rings 😂😂
Alan’s ipad is just here for the bants straight vibes 🙏
I’ve never been so proud to be scouse
"the vice chairs here. I take charge." "read the standing orders!!! READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!!!"
Jackie Weaver: "Look at me. I am the proper officer now."
TOTAL CHAOS 😂😂😂
16:13 😬 who’s gonna tell them
Why are the likes/dislikes turned off, I guarantee no one is disliking this absolute masterpiece of a drama
This is why I love England. Absolutely brilliant hahaha
The hand that controls the zoom meeting, is the hand that rules the world.
Does anyone know where I can buy a t-shirt with "Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on" printed on it?
Gollum makes an appareance at 5:58
I mean there is some serious stuff going down... meetings not called for months, lack of attendance, locked out of the website, people crowning themselves clerk. It is pandemonium. I also have named myself clerk.
When is the next season on Netflix? I am hooked.
Guitar man Peter Moore for senator of the counci!
Lockdown has brought me here at 3am and I can't stop laughing! Please can we have more episodes?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Does this remind anyone of the Myanmar coup?
HERE COMES THE SUBPOENA!!!!!!!!!!!
I like the way Roger Small and Barry Burkhill made their "entrance" by starting off facing in the opposite direction.  Old school performers!
Thank goodness for Julies IPad.
Some nasty misogynist men.
What the hell is going on
What a bunch of muppets
This is Anglican culture
Aled Brewerton is disgusting
I like to imagine that this is how the UKs Brexit negotiations were carried out
We’re team fuck Jackie weaver over here
5:30 'here comes the subpoena!'
Tell me this isn’t the Star Wars prequels in a nutshell
'You have no authority here Jackie Weaver. No authority at all!'   Jackie Weaver removes the chair from the meeting 🤣  3:58
Roger Small alters constitutions for breakfast 😤😤😤😤.
Beautiful in so many ways   I need to hear more from David Pincombe (4:28)
Can you imagine if these fuckers were incharge of our nukes 🤣🤣🤣
The Vice Chair sounds like Tim from Coronation Street. "I take cheargge!"
Just let Jackie run the council by herself.
"when do we plan to start"  "fuck off"
Fucking wish they un-banished the detractors for a final skirmish!
Best British politcal comedy since The Thick Of It. Incredible
Jackie Weaver is the new Carol Baskin
this is so avant garde
2:16 when someone starts rambling on in the group chat
Propah Officah
Fucking hell, this is like an episode of Inside No. 9 but nobody dies.
I'm calling very good am-dram fake
And these are typical of who is running councils? Glad I left the UK when I did. I am crying with laughter at this bunch
PC Clerk; "When do we plan to start?" ???; "Fu@k Off!" 😳😂😂😂 This meeting is absolutely hysterical! How unprofessional! Love it, I vote these meetings go live in future! 👌🏼
Are you telling me not a single geezer in the comments heard someone go “fuck off” under their breath in the first 15 seconds of the clip?!
*Jackie Weaver, YOU... SHALL NOT... PASS!!!!*
The classic “in my 25 years I’ve never seen anything like it” line, gets them every time
Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin at it again.
Bri’ish
Comedy Gold.... what utter morons. I hope people laugh at them in the street.
Incredible. Eighteen minutes of talking and nobody actually said anything 😅
Team Jackie Weaver !
This is fucking gold
"He did not attend a meeting in 6 months. The fact no meetings were held is irrellevant"
Hold on, so has Jackie Weaver staged a coup d’etat here?
What a shambles!  Very 'Monty Python' - "I paid for an argument". Red faces all round .....
When is Jackie Weaver getting a Netflix series
this cant be real life, it's too good.
#LocalBlokePolitics
fucking John Smith laughing his arse off
What even is a Parish Council?
They should sell tickets to these meetings. Get channel 4 on this can’t be any worse than bake off...
Jackie weaver thinks she owns the place smh
Peter Moore with a "QUITE RIGHTLY"   ooh shit's already started a minute in
Cynthia is an authoritarian dictator - foolish from her, very disappointed
The chaos here is so thick you could cut it with a knife
Please tell me this is real....please
18 minutes, and they achieved absolutely nothing. Scale this up and you have Westminster. No wonder the country is an absolute shambles.
Sue and June totally don’t like each other
Jackie is completely out of order, I HATE her - glad Aled could be the voice of reason here!!!!!
I don't remember this episode of Vicar of Dibley
Immature officious children. What a joke.
WHO IS ALAN MURDOCK
Sorry but I am NOT on Jackies side here - absolutely disgraceful from her today
when it opens with that quiet "fuck off" you know its gonna be good
“WILL YOU STOP TALKING” I can’t I’m genuinely pissing myself 🤣🤣🤣
Oh julies iPad is the best
This is the most Alan partridge thing I’ve seen 😭😭😭😭
10 seconds in and you can hear someone saying f@!”k off in the background ha ha
The chair decides
Who is Alan Murdoch?
I get wet lettuce vibes
Brilliant,
I anxiously await the fallout of this video.
this is hilarious but I’m struggling to understand who jackie weaver is and how she got there
Here from twitter...Good lord these nasty condescending supposedly grown men 😳
Who the fuck is the chairman??
House of Cards: The Golden Years
16:14 wouldn't want this to go viral would we now...
In her past life Jackie Weaver was Nurse Ratchet
John Smith is such a stirrer.
15:55 top 10 boomer moments
What in the Parishes and Recreation?
It's like watching cats trying to play the violin.
So Alan's Ipad was a member of the public?
Lovely comedy series here. Great idea to film in this way during the pandemic. Can’t wait for series 2. 👍
“I think it would be very easy to alter the constitution. No problem at all.” -The Fascists
0:10 "Fuck off"
The most British thing ive ever seen
5:47 Gollum makes a guest appearance
I particularly like how Jackie Weaver has to be called her full name, despite there not being another Jackie on the call.
Never did I imagine the Parish Council from my Hometown to go fucking viral. Mental.
😂😂😂
I love Aled’s iPad even tho he’s the villain
I’ve never been so proud to be British
May I interjéct by adding that the chimpanzees at Chester zoo make for a wonderfully entertaining insight into social networks
Moreover Chairman Mao, Chairman Jackie Weaver of the Peoples Republic of Handforth
*HERE COMES THE SUBPOENA*
0:40 not sure about that mate...
Dammit Julie’s iPad, the meeting hasn’t started yet!
0:05 let the shitshow begin...
Fucking hilarious!
This is absolutely brilliant!
I found this quite funny - thanks. Colin Surname, Clerk of Handforth Parish Council
5:51 "we're trying to have a teams meeting you fool"
Don’t know why but I started laughing as soon as that old man spun round at the start of the video   Made it look so dramatic😂😂
there is NOTHING more iconic to me than the chairman being like "you have no power here jackie weaver!" and jackie weaver demonstrably saying "don't i?"
The farce is strong in this one....
5:45 Gollum takes over
I represent a major hollywood studio.  Who do I speak to about acquiring the movie rights to this performance?
5:23 *hysterical laughter*
5:01 "what are you talking about? you don't know what you're talking about"
4:03 the part you've all been waiting for!
The Gollum impression from 5:46 is fairly solid
3:57 "you have no authority Jackie weaver, no authority at all.".   *Chairman gets kicked*
Anyone else want to go on a road trip to Handforth to meet the cast and crew?
"YOU CAN'T!"  I think you'll find she can and will.
John Smith fucks off to look for a Calendar when there’s a Calendar on his desktop computer / IPad. 🤣🤣
3:23 "where is this woman"
6:27 right after "Welcome to Handforth" is where the title card should go in the final edit
Like game of thrones this loving it
"Ian. Ian your muted" I love everything about this meeting
2:50 Julie's I pad takes a call... 😂
This was not a formal meeting it was a free for all - an open forum. Absolutely nothing of substance was discussed in the 18 minutes of this video. It could be that the missing bits refer to an Agenda but unless there was an item called debase and demean your fellow attendees then the Agenda was not followed.  Incidentally, where are the Agenda and Minutes for this meeting - I couldn't find them on the Council's website?   How dare they deride Jackie Weaver. Presumably she had been invited to attend? What an appalling, aggressive way to treat a guest. Jackie is an amazing source of information and advice on many aspects of Parish Council matters. I am amazed she stayed.  From the Parish Council Governance Toolkit: "The Clerk to the Council will be the Proper Officer of the Council and as such is under a statutory duty to carry out all the functions, and in particular to serve or issue all the notifications required by law of a local authority's Proper Officer"  So she didn't know the detail of Handforth PC's Standing Orders, should she be expected to?  Not all Standing Orders are the same. There are 90+ parishes in Cheshire East - in the interests of fairness Jackie would have to know the detail of every one.
2:15 WILL YOU STOP TALKING. Will you please listen? Will you please listen? Stop being whatever it is your trying to be.
Read the standing orders ⚡READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM⚡
I've just spent the last 30 minutes on Zoopla trying to find somewhere, anywhere, in Handforth to move my entire family. This is the greatest thing I've seen.
Can I attend too ? PLEASE let me get involved.
1:48 "you must know the basic law". Jeez what a savage...
Must be nice and fun working for the local council
Is there any truth to the rumours of a reunion show?
I was really aggrieved that someone from the brewerton household sat there like a laughing hyena Legendary
5:47 Hahahaha jackie has riled that dude up so bad that he starts rambling incoherently like Harry in Home Alone after being knocked to the floor for the 17th time.  Outstanding.
This is amazing
🤣🤣 what was the meeting actually about???
Anyone else in favour of kicking Sue from the council?
This is too funny I’m dying
The gasp from Julie’s iPad after Aled’s outburst will stay with me forever
Did anything even come out of this meeting except for the fact that John Smith is a laughing grass 😂
David called it. He said it was going to go viral. Its going to start a civil war
20 minutes long and absolutely nothing got sorted 😂
what in the world is this hahahahahaha
Vice Chair: “READ THE STANDING ORDERS, READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM”  David Pincombe: “dear me”  Jackie Weaver: “appalling behaviour”
11:01 - John Smith's right tit.
This is everything wrong with bureaucracy in the UK.
Justice 4 Jackie Weaver
Team Barry and Aled
i love jackie weaver and cyn, bad bitches. sue and ian ball would be the first to grass people up to the police. john smith thinks hes in the sopranos.
"When do we plan to start?"  "Fuck off."
Next week on Handford Parish Council. *Investigations into Wife Swapping have revealed not all the Wives have been returned. *Man who threw up in slippers was from out of the county lines. *Diamonds are NOT forever. *Last week's rolling stone STILL has no moss. *Bears DO go toilet in the woods and why proper bins are essential. And *Masturbating on zoom calls will result in you bring muted.
Ian has RECEIPTS. Underrated character
The first guy is an absolute Chad
Jackie out
this is one of the unintentionally funniest things i’ve seen for months  i hope there’s a follow-up to this, i’m truly engrossed
Jackie Weaver seems like a nasty woman drunk on power.
Read the standing orders! READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM.
The Elder Trolls
When Jackie said "it is not going to be finished this side of Christmas" I felt that
Jackie weaver: please refer to me as Britney spears from now on ~karen cackle~
John Smith is Andy Burnham's brother!
There should be a comedy series on BBC 3 or wherever and it should be based on like 10 minute episodes of meetings/calls on teams, where there are arguments and weird and random stuff going on in the background. That would be ace. (Unless there is a show based on this).
6 months later, channel 4 introduces “inside Handforth community parish council”
"We thought in 2021, we had seen off one of the worst years of the pandemic and that there was hope on the horizon...but we were wrong..."  "What happened?"  "Jackie Weaver"
Blimey we need to add Conducting Meetings to the syllabus in school.
Different gravy! Incredible insight to how the country functions (assuming this is genuine?!?).
Jackie Weaver IS THE SENATE!!
Jackie Weaver has no authority here!
15:04 is my favourite. I wonder what was in that letter...
“He is not the clerk of the parish council,"... He's a very naughty boy!!!
Theres too many stupid old farts in the uk
Aled's ipad's laugh at Sue is bloody brilliant 😂😂
Queen Cyn 💕👑
LEAVE JACKIE WEAVER ALOOOOONE!!!
I'm a parish Cllr and a town Cllr and I have to confess I found this amusing. This is unbelievable
Is Jackie Weaver a hero, a villain or a complex character that defies simple classification? I can't even tell.
That really subtle "fuck off" or whatever he said at the start, has fucking sent me creasing! This is gold!
Drinking game: take a shot each time someone says “Meeting”
We’ve just witnessed a political coup and you’re laughing?
Handforth PC Clerk is the main character and I stand by that statement.
Jackie Weaver / Hyacinth Bucket.
“Who is this woman?” *SHOCKED AND OFFENDED NOISE*
Jackie Weaver is the founder of Dominion.
Top ten anime betrayals
I now understand where Midsomer Murders got their scripts from.  #lightbulbmoment
Shag, Marry, Kill, Handforth Parish Council Go
How in the name of fuck did COVID19 miss these bastards!?!!
This is better than any BBC sitcom in decades.
Jackie Weaver for Prime Minister
No one puts Jackie Weaver in a corner.
I’m so invested in the drama
“She’s kicked Barry out. I’m leaving.”
"Put your hand down now, Peter"
Why are people defending Jackie. She's seems like a dictator and this is a coup of the highest order.
Cynthia sue and Jackie are all unbearable knobheads
What is this? Lord of the rings crossed with dad's army?
Is this a skit ?
Breaking news: Jackie Weaver has just taken Handforth in a bloody coup
Where did David come from? Just as Ian is managing to get his point across after unmuting his mic, David cuts right across him
how does one go about nominating something for Best Editing Oscar?
Imagine what it’s like when they are having the council meeting face to face 😂
John Smith’s a real one
Malcom Tucker has entered the meeting.
I have never watched an 18 min YouTube video all the way through before 😂😂😂
The boomer energy in this meeting is completely demonic. No wonder this country is going down the drain
Is this from radio 4
No one seems to have hear the "Fuck off" at 0:11? Such civility!
.... this is unparalleled. It's like a cross between Game of Thrones and Alan Partridge.
The quote potential here is endless.
Good Lord....all of you should resign immediately and pursue the most urgent order of business which is GETTING A FU@KING LIFE!  I mean the country is crisis with the pandemic and you lot are bickering over who gets to hold the conch! (Check Lord of the Flies) for that reference.
Oh my God my stomach hurts from laughing
Do anyone know the back story here? Why was everyone so cross at the beginning?
Alan’s wig is the best thing about this and there’s so much competition
Sue with an olive branch at 10:30 swiftly batted back by Cyn... WHAT THEATRE
Can we submit this to the BAFTAs?
"The member of the public wishes to speak" "sorry?" "Peter wishes to speak"
Jackie: I'm just glad this is a Zoom meeting.  So are we Jackie, so are we.
The whispered fuck off at the start... oooof
10 seconds in: "F*ck off"  And thus sets the tone
Jackie, honey, this is not gonna be finished THIS side of Christmas either I don't think
I hope things are smooth now this was entertaining though
Whos Alan Murdoch?  Yes please! Hahhaha
From the first "Fuck off!" at 0:10, I was enthralled.
Burkhill's introduction being him facing entirely the wrong way made me lose it
“We don’t what this to start a turf war.”  $h1t just got serious!
'When do we plan to start?' 'F**k Off'!' 🤣
Dear God. These people are responsible for parish budgets!!!! No wonder we have exorbitant Council Tax. What a bunch of clowns.
Jackie Weaver > Carol Baskins
Me:  Checking what's  trending on Twitter.  Saw Aleds Ipad  Reckoned someone lost his/her ipad.  Clicked to see and next thing I know I was kicked out of my Wifi network by Jackie Weaver.
Poor Alan got booted out for being an iPad. He was muted!!!
🤣🤣🤣 BRILLIANT!
Cynthia doesn't agree with anything does she? I bet she's fun at parties 🙄
"If this goes viral it will start a war of words...." hahaha
JACKIE WEAVER FOR PM
Comedy gold. Crying with laughter 🤣
I'm so proud of my country.
I feel like everyone is just ignoring the whispered "fuck off" at 0.11
“I’m Clerk of the Parish Council”  “I’m Clerk of the Parish Council”  “We’re all Clerk of the Parish Council”
What a bunch of absolute clowns.
the toilet flush did it for me. Magic  lockdown content!
Meanwhile on Plague island
This is like something from the vicar of dibley
Listen carefully to the start you can hear someone saying f**koff.
omg this is amazing. Seems like Jackie Weaver is enjoying her abusive power.
It’s all kicking off here jeez
Well they didn't bloody do anything
🤣🤣🤣 love it
I'm trying not to wake the house up laughing
Did someone flush a toilet at 7:13? 💀😂
appalling behavior... lol!
"one of the councillors didn't attend a meeting for the last 6 months... The fact there were no meetings held is irrelevant"
This is fucking STELLAR.
Can someone explain what the hell is going on and then provide any further videos pls 😂😂😂
He hasn't attended a meeting for 4 months the fact that there weren't any meetings is irrelevant
I need more. I've watched this twice. Netflix series?
Can anyone explain what this is I've just watched .
WE’RE TRYING TO HAVE A TEAMS MEETING YOU FOOL WE’RE TRYING TO HAVE A TEAMS MEETING YOU FOOL
"When do we plan to start" "Fuck off" Me before every zoom meeting ever
Waiting for them to all wack on a black cloak and start chanting bonum commune communitatis
Ok. Now I want to get into local politics.
5:50 "The power of christ COMPELS YOU"  To priest doing excorcism: "We're trying to have a team meeting you fool"
The use of ultra close-up throughout really sells the humanity of the key characters, allowing the audience to form an intimate understanding of their desires. Truly stunning direction
We want Jackie on our Airsoft team 😁
Just what the nation needed
I DIE 😆
This is absolute class 😂😂🤣🤣
Team Jackie Weaver aka Britney Spears!
The most interesting development for me was finding out that the man just stated that he was clerk without consulting anyone. Shocking behaviour. Jackie was in the right all along...
I've watched this 3 times and it only gets better and better.  LOVE IT.  This is what lockdown has done. 😂🤣😂🤣😂❤
These people are part of our council leadership. Remember that.
Are the English okay?
*mY fEeT aRe CuT tO rIbBoNs*
Strongly worded letter of *a u t h o r i t y*
They're all actors. The plan was to go viral for this upcoming sitcom.
The toilet flushes add just the right layer of farce to proceedings.  Astounding work from everybody and Jackie turns it round full circle in the end.
Turf war 😂
Honestly, upload every meeting and monetise them. Reduce your precept to zero and become the most popular Parish Council in the country.
Jackie Weaver - we stan!
"I noted that the Chairman of the council, before he departed from the meeting, had his title as "clerk" on the screen? " " em, I must admit I did not notice that" "yes, he did, I have a photo of it" 😅
Not eggshells, glass, my feet are cut to ribbons   😂😂😂
Jackie Weaver: "I AM THE SENATE"
I wish they played this on BT Sport instead of spurs chelsea tonight.
Read the standing orders. READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM.
This really needed Captain Mainwaring to take charge...
The funniest video I've seen in a long time
Is this real??? 😂😂😂
This is brilliant
this is the funniest thing I've seen in weeks
Comedy gold.  I'm crying.  Endless one liners.  Jackie Weaver rules
Failed to attend a meeting and the fact there where no meetings is irrelevant. Awesome John
THIS MEETING HAS NOT BEEN CALLED ACCORDING TO THE LAW
This easily is the most chaotic video conference that I have ever witnessed 😂
Jackie Weaver, what a legend 😂
I need to see this letter
I’m the vice chairman I take charge
The opening shot being the back of Roger Small's head is just *chef's kiss* - kudos to the director
‘Ya muted Ian!!!’
Brilliant.  Just joy.  Lovely, one might say, pedantic know-how of procedure, refrain, subtlety & humour that brings it all to some kinda even kilter.  So English, so stand in the queue.  I'm alright Jack.
Comedy gold... I'm gasping for breath.
Brilliant. He's not the parish clerk! He's a very naughty boy.
Boomers
I didn't want this to end. In 18 minutes I got to know these characters, care for them. I want the whole gang to succeed: Cyn, John Smith, Jackie, Sue, all of them.
“Sue?”
The sad thing is this replicates most council meetings, now younknow why we are in the sh!t.😆😆
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE JACKIE WEAVER
Jackie Weaver: I propose we implement order 66. Does anyone second that?  Cyn: nooooooooooooo
Pure comedy 🤣
Damn u jackie
Who whispers "F*ck off" at 11 secs in? Pure class! 🤣
This is funniest thing I've seen in years. I'm here for the turf war. Jackie Weavers army unite!
underrated line - We’re trying to have a Teams meeting you F O O L
Is this real?? Surely not
Is any of this fake? This amazing if not.
I’m surprised Jackie Weaver didn’t announce ‘In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Parish Council will be reorganized into the first Handforth Empire, for a safe and secure society’ halfway though
THE NORTH
It’s like Staged in a care home
Keeping up appearances starring Jackie Weaver as Mrs Bucket.
I can’t wait for the 2nd Tuesday in January. Although I’m not sure what the date is....
This has everything. I'm gripped, can't wait for episode 2
We don't want a turf war breaking out
“i think if this goes viral on the internet or facebook or whatever, it will start a war of words”.  nostradamus lives!
This needs to me made into a TV show!!!
the tension when she asked whether they disruptive mob should be let in. as compelling as Scorsese.
“We don’t want a turf war breaking out” All I could picture after that was Jackie Weaver and her crew turning up to Handforth playing fields at 9pm with a baseball bat to meet the resistance and finally eliminate those who wronged her.
I hope Netflix do a Tiger King style documentary about this.
‘You have no authority Jackie Weaver’.  Jackie Weaver is staging a coup, by electing her own chair.....  Meanwhile Cyn says ‘no’.
"A nice big pot of mushy tea?"   "Seconded"
So funny
I have strong suspicions that Jackie Weaver's husband was eaten by tigers
This is the greatest thing I've watched in a long time
This needs to go viral.
YO the next meeting’s coming up in a few days
"Who' is Alan Murdoch?"
I know someone like Jackie  Weaver and she's a proper pain in the arse
Move over Carol Baskin, Jackie Weaver's in town.
“He is not the clerk of the parish council, whether or not he declares himself to be or not, or makes himself a badge that says ‘I’m the clerk of the parish council.’” This is PURE Thick of It!
That was a literal insurrection at the start. Jackie Weaver stormed the capitol of the Handforth Parish Council Planning and Environment Committee zoom meeting #MHPCP&ECGA
Aw this is fucking hella cute
Democracy manifest
Explains the brains which led to Brexit! Hilarious 🤣
Goddamn who knew the Clerk was such a coveted position?! 🤣🤣🤣
Jackie Weaver: "Shall we get this meeting started?" Barry Burkhill: **turns back on her**
Absolute disgrace.  Where are the Council Standing Orders,   Agenda,  and adherence to the Code of Conduct? Council needs to be taken over by County Council  until they can behave in a civilised way, or disbanded and fresh elections held.   The Clerk is highly paid, and presumable qualified - CILCA,  and every Councillor has signed the Code of Conduct.  They are representatives of the people, spending local people's money through their precept and should all be thoroughly ashamed of themselves now.
If there was a WW3 end game and these were the last 7 people sitting in bunkers talking to each other, this would still be humanity's final words.
Aside from the awful bullying.... ARE YOU A CLERK OR A PROPER OFFICER?!? 🤣
This is one of the best things I've ever seen.
This is better than staged
"READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM"!!!
"SHE'S KICKED HIM OUT" LOOL!
Wtf
Crying
"The Chairman of the Council is the Chairman of the Council" Glad we cleared that up.
The old boys laughing at 5.29 onwards. Classic.
What a glorious disaster this is 👏😂
This is amazing. The guy who kept saying "We're trying to have a Teams meeting you fool!" sounded so much like Reece Shearsmith I was half expecting this to turn into a secret episode of League of Gentlemen or Inside No. 9!!
Jackie Weaver with some absolutely baller moves. We Stan, as the kids say
jackie weaver wielded her power with devastating results! she don’t need to read those standing orders.
Sat there like a laughing hyena
This is replicated across the whole country
It's like a comedy
Aled's Ipad was invaded by Gollum at 5:50
Fuck off. Right off the bat. Hilarious. Absolutely hilarious.
"Can we be assured that we won't be thrown out of the meeting like we were last time?"  oh my god theres LORE
Is this real? If so I wonder if the Handforth Parish Council members would be willing to act as mentors to our local council, because in many people's views they're a shambles. Shakespeare would be turning in his grave if he could be a fly on the wall at some of the meetings. Come on Handforth PC, rally round, and show our guys how it should be done.
There are just too many quotes to list here. I’m dying. What can go wrong?  Old people?  Technology? Neighborhood meeting? Who’s in charge?
What am I watching?!
This would never happen in Dibley
Gollum 5:53
Off to a flying start with a "fuck off" lmao
16:12 "I think if this goes viral on the internet or Facebook, it's going to start a war of words."
THE GREATER GOOD!
I'm moving to this area soon, Jesus Christ what am I getting into
God help the people of Handforth.
Didn't realise tagging yourself incorrectly on a Zoom call was such a scandal
John Smith for Prime Minister
Proof that committees are comprised solely of people who love being on committees.
This is absolutely incredible
16:15 😂😂
Cyn says 'no'.
Jackie Weaver, what a wanker...
Just realised I've met John Smith 😂😂
9:46 "We did put the disruptive members into the waiting room, shall we let them back in?"
There are only like 7 of them.  Are they all going to be on the sub-committee?   I cannot stop laughing even though I have no idea what they are talking about.  I don’t think they do either. Are they even at the same meeting?🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I need to watch the sequel. Heck. I might even go to the next meeting as a member of the public.
You know it's going to be funny when 12 seconds in all you have heard is "when do we plan to start" "fuck off"
This has nothing on a PTA meeting
Its no wonder nothing gets done. Boomers.
Hand down now Peter!
This is comedy gold its been a while since tears and snot flowed so freely, I fucking love this thank you
John Smith asking it to be put online doing us a solid. respect
Jackie Weaver is the Carole Baskin of 2021
Aled's Ipad was invaded by Gollum at 5:50
Jackie Weaver is leading a very British coup...
Cyn WILL HAVE NO TRUCK WITH LAUGHING HYENAS!
This is incredible 😂😂😂😂
"The chairman of the council, is the chairman, of the arrrr, council!" LOL!!!
Lovely stuff.
IAN Ball: “I have a photo : - )”
Please tell me this scripted
We should set up a sub-committee of the steering group.
The chairman of the council is the chairman of the....of the....of the council.
This whole thing makes me shudder. The lack of microphone muting when others are speaking is DISGUSTING
I think that Gollum comes in the background at one point.
Can't believe there's so many lawbreakers in Cheshire East
If you thought Carole Baskin was bad wait until you meet Jackie Weaver 🤣
WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE A TEAMS MEETING YOU FOOL
John Smith seems to be hosting a Zoom Meeting nearby what sounds like somebody flushing a Toilet 🚽...!!!
Your muted Ian!
Aled's iPad ALSO went into Wanker Mode™ insulting Birkenhead.
This the beginning of a Midsomers Murder episode...hahahaha
FFS Brilliant...  this should be on the telly.  I reckon if this goes viral...... lol We don't want to prejudice anything.... :) :) :)
This is absolute Gold. Undeniable Gold.
Poor Alan's ipad labeled as disruptive. 🙄
John Smith is the most John Smith looking person ever. Perfect casting
Barry Burkhill is one legendary name.
"Read, the Standing Orders. Read them and understand them." -   Aled's iPad is ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Story line for a new Midsomer Murders episode?
John Smith is a malevolent force. Jackie Weaver is a scapegoat for Smith's actions.
"Laughing hyienas" sounds like parliament!
This is a lot like punjabi politics, looks like English the same lol
Absolutely hilarious!!!
One of the councillors did not attend a meeting for 6 months...the fact that none were held is irrelevant 😂😂😂
This is better than any soap opera... Tune into next month's.. dum dum dum dum dumdum
OH JACKIE WEAVER
Councillor Trash
Well played Jackie Weaver. Delete and block them next time. 😂😂😂
Steven Morgan who posted this THANK YOU SO MUCH 😂😂🤣
you know it's gonna go off at 0:10 when the second sentence spoken is "fuck off"
John Smith went into Wanker Mode™ with a unfunny joke about Scousers & as Chairman he requested that the meeting was made available. 🤣
"You have no authority here jackie weaver ! " 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Where's the rest of these. Hook em to my veins
Literally a room full of Karen’s and an accurate view of everything wrong with middle class Britain.
Aled's iPad went full Gollum
Jackie Weaver: I AM THE CLERK  Not yet your not  Jackie Weaver: Its treason then!
Jackie's one of those self important types who becomes a magistrate just for the joy to bully people
Comedy gold. The funniest thing I've seen all year. Made lockdown almost bearable. Thank you to whoever found this. So many great moments but I only heard the very very quiet "f#ck off" right at the start the second time round, when they ask to start the meeting! 😂
Who exactly is Jackie Weaver ? The Boss of The Illuminati...!!!
I cried so much 😂😂
‘Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on’ .... where the fuck did that come from
I like how in the beginning, when everybody was all uptight, they were talking all posh and eloquent. But towards the end, when they started relaxing, all their genuine accents started coming out.  I love England!
Could, Guitar Man have that background to impress when doing online flirting. 🎸
3:50 well there's no need for that!
Jackie Weaver ate them upppp but Julie’s I pad stole the show
this is fucking jokes
Brilliant! When’s the next meeting?
7:12.Did somebody flush the toilet??? 🤣🤣🤣
So so so good!
Boomer Tech all over this.
All the worst aspects of local government - petty squabbling, over-inflated egos, all drawing from public funds and not actually serving the public with anything tangeable or of benefit to the public, just infighting and serving their own agendas and feeding their own self importance. If it wasn't costing their local parish tax payers money, it would be comical.
The vice chair is here!!! I take charge 🤣🤣🤣
Imagine if these people represent you 😂😂😂
This video whilst hilarious is a prime example of why Scientifically-Advanced Extra-Terrestrials avoid revealing themselves to Humanity due to the people of Earth constantly fighting for authority once collected within groups.
READ THE STANDING ORDERS!
Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!! 😂😂😂
This is the English soul laid bare.
Can we all do a nationwide clap for John Smith next Wednesday? That hero's suggestion made viewing this masterpiece possible.
Absolute crack
The season 6 premiere of Inside No 9 has leaked I see
Had to deal with people from Handforth when i worked for M&S as a kid, just a bunch of Tory voting boomers with nothing to do in retirement so cause trouble for everyone. We had one complain that his order of M&S furniture arrived in a truck that didn’t have enough M&S branding on, and he’d told all his neighbours when it was arriving and didn’t live up to the grande entrance. Wanted a refund or discount on 10k of stuff.
The way Alan reduces the women to giggling schoolgirls is LIFE!
Peter Moore’s raised hand
Is this BREXIT?
Did anyone else catch the little "fuck off" at the very start of the meeting?
‘Yes please.’
16:12 HE KNEW
“My personal opinion is that it’s for political gain” “EUURGHHHH” “...sue?”
Jackie weaver the Iron Lady of handforth.
my first point is to apologise to Jackie, well, welcome to Handforth
The best content of the year so far!! What’s the backstory?? What’s the follow up!! We need more 😂😂
"You are on this council, but we do not grant you the rank of presiding officer" "This is ridiculous, it's unfair!"
Well, I am cancelling my move to Handforth. And it’s environs.
“I haven’t got my diary in front of me, sorry!”  *sat in front of a computer with a world of information at her fingertips*
In Jackie Weaver we trust
Jackie Weaver aka Britney Spears is a babe. Is she single?
The original chair was correct, she is acting illegally.
We need a feature length film of Jackie weavers coup d’tat now
Royston Vasey meets Mrs Jackie Hitler
The silent F**koff 30-seconds in completely sets the tone for the rest of the episode. Genius!
Team Weaver 👊
Unseat the chairman and vice chairman, take back control. Viva la revolucion.
🤣😂
Do people get their bins emptied?
This is very funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣 The comments are funnier
This is the funniest thing I've seen in a long time.  Literally howling!
nobody: cynthia: 😠 NO 😠
Aled's Ipad is the Man of the Match. Brilliant performance from "MRS WEAVER PLEASE" to "READ EM AND UNDERSTAND EM" whilst being hushed down
Oh my word hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
3:17 had me in pieces
Is this for real?  It's just epic!!
Roger Small has a good voice!
The official notice on their website homepage seems to reflect a lot of what happens in these meetings
Gollum coming in at 5.50 is haunting.
This is quite possibly the greatest thing I have ever had the pleasure of seeing.
To think this is the ‘best of...’
Remember this when your Council Tax DD starts in April.
This is the best video iv ever watched! 🤣
Toilet flushes *rudely*
John Smith for PM. Jackie Weaver is like a sexy Hyacinth Bucket.
"please refer to me as britney spears from now on"
This is how empires fall......
Poor Jackie weaver 😂
We don't want a turf war breaking out 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mute himmmmmmm
I need more
YOU’RE MUTED IAN
I'm just trying to figure out who qualifies as the protagonist
Petition for Jacki Weaver to play Jackie Weaver in the inevitable film adaptation
She's kicked Barry out! I'm goin'
I want to see the strongly worded letter
Thank you for whoever recorded this. You have done a great service. 😂
Jackie has been working on that Britney joke since 2001!
Why do we have parish councils,these are an embarrassment.😷😷😧😧
surely this isn't real, it's too much of a parody of every shit Zoom / Teams meeting ever
“No, no I’m AGAINST that Sue”
Who is Alan Murdoch? Yes please. 😂😂😂😂
That whisper of "Fuck off" at the start killed me haha
That toilet has no authority to flush here
“I take chyarrge!”
First five seconds, the quiet "f*** off" from somebody who doesn't know they can be heard, sets the scene perfectly for the rest of this show. :)
Julie's iPad 😂😂😂
I stand shoulder to shoulder with Aled’s iPad.
READ THE STANDING ORDERS. READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM
Thank god these people didn’t get into a room together. It would have been a bloodbath.
YAAAAAAAS JACKIE! SLAY QUEEN!
Ladies and gentlemen, this is democracy manifest
3 minutes in and I’m expecting the old man to get thrown off pretty soon. Lmao this is so funny
The way some names appear full screen at the start is just like a summer blockbuster.
this slaps
Carpentersville - British Edition
Absolutely incredible, superb
Makes you wonder if this is how the tory cabinet conduct their zoom meetings in dealing with the pandemic.
00:10 3:45 4:20 5:48 6:28 9:40 13:25 16:12
We don't want a turf war.
I actually snorted at "Please refer to me as 'Britney Spears' from now on" 😂😂
This is the whitest thing I have ever seen
I'M HERE I TAKE CHARGE
Are we all here from twitter?
"Jackie Weaver has no authority here" is getting made up into a door mat. T-shirts, mugs the merch will be flying out the door!
This is glorious. Thanks for uploading
Laughed throughout but the cherry on top is 3:03 😂 😂
This is priceless.
I’m glad I live in an unparished area. I don’t even know why they still exist.
Collective age of that council must be fucking nuts. No wonder fuck all gets done in councils.
"Jedi, I am the Handforth senate"
Hands up every one who's had to endure a Jackie Weaver in their lives. I feel the pain of everyone else on that council.
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM
We'll now elect a new chair...  NO YOU WON'T! VICE CHAIR IS HERE! I TAKE CHARGE!
Proceed with order 66
Never thought I'd be so invested in a local council feud in an area I'd never heard of until today. Alas, here I am.
First guy turns round like he is in the starting line-up on Sky Sports
This is better than anything the BBC makes!
90 seconds in and I want to murder them all.
This is gold, love the flushing toilet at the best time lol
5.59 Gollum entered?
When is the next episode?? 🤣
it's Jackie Weaver Bi^%h ... hahahah call me britney spears hahahahhaha
THE GREATER GOOD!!
With age, comes such wisdom.
Comedy gold
The sexual chemistry between Alan's iPad and Sue is palpable.
Hahaha 'I think if this goes viral we'll have a turf war'
Everyone's talking about The Thick of It, I really recommend Death of Stalin which is also a creation of Armando Iannucci.
"l've never seen such a strongly worded letter in 25 years!"  "You've not been to Handforth often enough."
18:09 secs of pure joy. Thank you for bringing this into my life.
Jackie Weaver deserves an OBE
"I take charge"
Absolute comedy gold. Hahahahaha
Best 18mins of Lockdown so far...Thank you HPC.
I've not seen a power grab like Jackie's since Attack of the Clones.
Who let gollum in at 5:50 precious?
"SUBPOENA" - Aled's Ipad
More like dad's army 😂
Ah. The sub committee of the steering group....
Did Chris Morris and Armando Ianucci write this sitcom?
A turf war.....in Handforth!
For the greater good.....
This is magnificent. Jackie Weaver, a Gollum cameo, what sounded like a flushing toilet, the "I'm on a meeting" line, a reported coup attempt, a "laughing hyena", Britney Spears, "Who is Alan Murdoch?", etc.
John Smith is also on a special list.
SK9 👊🏻
Jackie Weaver's coup would put the CIA to shame.
Pandemic lockdown and boredom has led us to watching drama at a parish council meeting. 🥴😩😂
The toilet flush was perfection.
This is going to appear in an end of the year viral show 😂😂😂
This is one of the funniest things I have ever seen
Little Engerland
"I've never seen such a strongly worded letter in 25 years. You've not been to Handforth often enough"
This is absolute genius work. There's new characters added with no explanation every few seconds. Both gentleman named "Aled's iPad" are paranoid schizophrenics. And of course, Jackie Weaver is a woman (or rather a dictator) who needs no explanation.
This is hilarious. So good to see great comedy without the need for loads of swearing. Top stuff.
WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE TEAMS MEETING YOU FOOL!
@16:08 "I think if this goes viral on the internet,  or facebook or whatever, it will start a war of words" - David Pinccombe [as he rudely interrupts Ian Ball mid-sentence]  😂 😂
Julie's I pad: "oh hiya, im just in a meeting at the moment, can i give you a call back when it finishes? okay, alright bye byyye" Julie had no idea what was coming...
Oh this is so so so funny
I'm afraid there's no way of stopping him calling himself clerk
I once attended a parish council meeting  for the newspaper I currently work at. They spent nearly an hour arguing over how big public notice boards should be. If only that meeting was as entertaining as this.
"can we make this recording available" "I don't see why not"
#justice4jackieweaver Down with the weird Handforth Parish Council shouty men!
Julie's in a meeting at the moment but she'll call you back when it finishes
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen
"it's all for the greater good" "greater good"
Brilliant 😂
Alan Partridge should be on this committee
"MRS WEAVER, PLEASE!!"
“Who’s Alan Murdoch?”
Read the standing orders!! Read them and understand them!!
Don’t think parish council’s are any different from parliament or other councils. The only difference is this petty power trips and arguments are done mostly behind doors and not on zoom 🤣
This is everything 🤣
You have no authority here, Jackie Weaver.  It is not for you to deny the election of the chair, clerk!
I really would like to know what the whole story is here.
"Ian? Ian? IAN YOU'RE MUTED!!"
I think Jackie wants to elect a chairman
Read them and understand them!
Where's the meeting from January!!
13:36 - "One of the counselors, from the west ward, did not attend the meetings for 6 months... the fact that there were no meetings held, is irrelevant."
This is beautiful. 😂
Is there a difference between clerk and public officer? I got to know
Is this real?!! Oh my fucking god, dying 😂😂 I hope these people aren't paid tax money for FUCK sakes
"That is why ashley- Ph ive said his name there" 😂😂😂😂😂
#BrewertonGangForLife
Jackie Weaver is the UK Carole Baskin..😆
Anyone know what this meeting is even about?? 😂😂
Is that Gollum I hear?
Jackie Weaver’s fucking anime teir villain playing 4d chess with the Chad PC Clerk
This has to be all a set up surely!? No way this is a real meeting that isn't scripted!!??
'Who's Alan Murdoch please?' 'Yes please.'
On Facebook I found a private group called "Handforth Parish Council". It has one member.  #teamjackieweaver
What are you talking about? You don't know what you are talking about. The chairman of the council is the chairman of the, uh, of the, council.
This reminds me so much of my home town.
5m30s Aled and co really take things downhill
Jackie Walker is this year's Carole Baskin.
If you think this a one off you've never met a parish councillor!
Who invited Gollum @ 5:55 ?
For the greater good
Love this!!!
So . . . it's treason then?
Is this real or a parody?
JACKIE WEAVER DID NOTHING WRONG.  ;)
Donny-on-the-Wold
What are the differences between clerk and proper officer?
It's Pythonesque on one level and terrifying on another - do some of these people actually have democratic accountability. WTF was going on? Is it always like that?
YOU HAVE NO POWER HERE JACKIE WEAVER THE GREY
Looking forward to the next episode
Tories?
An advert for why nobody should bother getting involved in local politics. Too many busybody retirees with too much time on their hands and a thirst for any position of power no matter how small.
@steve Morgan the "prequel" in the description is actually the meeting after this one, more drama goes down. Gollum threatens to sue
This is a local council meeting for local people. We’ll have no trouble here.
“And her name was Jackie Weaver...  And her name was Jackie Weaver...  And her name was Jackie Weaver... ‘" #
Old white men can’t handle women part 2021
You have no power here, Jackie the Grey
What is Jackie's role?
I had no idea Golum lived in Handforth
W E L C O M E    T O    H A N D F O R T H !!!
For the greater good
The reason the ice caps are melting, we are stuck at home due to a pandemic and the reason students pay a fortune for education displayed in one 18 minute video. F**k boomers
"the man is a complete disgrace."  "Ok, thank you Peter."  Makes me proud to be British 🇬🇧
We’re trying to have a Teams meeting you fool!  This is endlessly quotable.
Hor-rif-ic
The "fuck off" at the very start is just stunning
"We're trying to have a Teams meeting you fool!", indeterminable Gollum noises.
I love how they decided to release this thinking they'd come up good in it. This level of delusion is strangely fascinating to watch.
Think the funniest thing is just "Julie's iPad" randomly appearing intermittently 😂
'If this goes viral on the internet...' LOL
Has Aled's dad seen an ipad before?
This is so hilarious and chaotic I have never enjoyed violence so much
Jackie weaver is a nice lady. These muppets need sorting out.
Imagine being a Tory, all this effort just to be despised by anyone with a decent education under 50.  A cancer to Britain.
Iconic

Justice for Aled’s iPad
I support the strong leadership displayed by "Aled's Ipad" father son duo
Anyone who didn't rewind at 8:30 to check the claim of illegal "moniker on screen" earlier just isn't living life to the full
The antithesis of the Vicar of Dibley
YOU'RE MUTED IAN
It's amazing this is actually real. And not some greatly written comedy sketch. So many little things add to the hilarity and absurdity of it all.
This is why nothing gets fucking done in this country. Petty anachronistic egomaniacs.
Much as John Smith tries with his one liners, the entertainment value really falls off a cliff after the rabble rousers are ejected
Welcome to Handforth
"Is that...ideal?"  "It really makes no difference"
What a shower of inadequates', few of them understand the rules and the rest make the rules up as they go along.  All paid for from your council tax by means of a levy.
no FUCKIN way this is real I'm dying
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL
At 11.00 praying they're allowed back in.
YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY  HERE JACKIE WEAVER
Sorry but AT 5.48 - is ALED being possessed?
Why am I watching this and why am I entertained?
Can we get a spin off for Alan's iPad?
STOP TALKING
Hello Jackie! You look nice!
The editing is Oscar-worthy! 🤣🤣
Julie's sigh of exasperation at 3'25 😄
THIS IS MY NEW FAVE VIDEO
Each and every one of them voted for Brexit. Guaranteed. Am hoping this makes it onto The Last Leg. Adam,Josh and the Arsenal fan would have a field day with this.
Yes but who is Alan Murdoch 😁

How do ever get anything done? Turf war 🤣🤣
Love Jaquie
Chancellor Jackie Weaver aka. Empress Palpatine seizes power following years of manipulation of the local parish council
I stand with Jackie
Hang on, he was thrown out of the last meeting? You mean there's a prequel?
This is a Monty Python sketch 😂 Jeez
Did they also record that meeting they were planning for the second Tuesday in January???
Incredible!
READ THE STANDING ORDERS!
Were trying to have a Teams meeting, you fool!
I’ve not laughed so much in ages #teamjackie
This is comedy gold!
The council who put zoo into zoom!
When Aled booted off... that was is... I’m hooked. Eastenders... eat your heart out.
Ian predicted this going viral and there was mention of 'turf wars' breaking out. I'm crying.
This is the funniest thing I've seen all week
I propose we grant Jackie Weaver emergency powers to form a clone army.
Part of my job title is "parish liaison officer" and I used to be a parish councillor in a different part of the country. I can sadly confirm this behaviour is a fairly regular occurrence having attended dozens of these meetings.   Parish councillors are all volunteers but egos are rarely left at the door in my experience.  None of them have a clue regarding the rules and regulations of such meetings.
"The Councillor has not attended a meeting for 6 months. The fact that there hasn't been one is irrelevant."
😹😹😹😹
Forget the capitol insurrection,  this is democracy manifest.
Hahahaha John smiths only contribution just intermittent laughing 😂😂
"Can we be assured that we won't be thrown out of the meeting like we were last time?" Hahaha so this is just the latest in a long-running saga!
Welcome to Handforth Jackie :D
My dad had to present his case for a loft conversion to our local planning committee over Microsoft Teams. The parallels between this video and that call are uncanny.   Thank god these people have no real power.
And we wonder why nothing ever gets done!!
Allan’s bitter 😂
We are all Jackie Weaver.
Jacky weaver is a right Karen
corruption and chaos in the highest echelons of public office
‘One of the councillors did not attend a meeting for 6 months...the fact there were no meetings held is irrelevant’ 😂
This is incredible
Jackie Weaver ruling with an iron fist
I need more
Justice for Handforth PC Clerk
I am also laughing like a hyena. Poor Jackie Weaver.
Surely this has got to be a skit? Absolutely brilliant and incredibly British 😂
"Where's the German, where's the German gone"!?
👏 gold
This can’t be real?! This has to be a parody hahaha
0:10 in and it’s already kicking off.
This is comedy gold! 🤣
This is comedy gold. Oh to be British 😂🙈
Roger  Small: let me formulate an official reply to that letter * toilet flushes *
Was that the full meeting?
This is far better than the SNL skit about zoom meetings
5:50 this is hbomberguy voice lol
IS THIS REAL?!?!? I don’t know what’s real anymore 😂😂😂
This is brilliant. 😂🤣😂
Extraordinary ! Thanks so much for sharing
Why is this so fckinng funny holy shit, just  a bunch of 15 yo using unusual words XDD
Bloody brilliant. Within the first five seconds someone saying “F**K Off! 😂😁😂😂😂😂😂
Absolutely beautiful
It’s sue being the ✨ shit stirrer ✨ for me
We stan our Queen Jackie Weaver
How to achieve nothing
This is amazing 🤣
Ideal for an episode of Creature Comforts
This is absolutely brilliant and about to go viral. Here at 900 views
These old white men being rude to each other are such a bad example
This has to be satire...
"we don't want a turf war breaking out"
READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!!!!!!
Fucking lol.  These are elected representatives!
"when do we plan to start?"  F U C K   O F F  The single most British line in the entire meeting
I was President of a university society and it was just like this. Personality clashes with no-one having a fucking clue what they were doing. I barely knew what I was doing. Never doing anything like that again.
These people have influence over locsl lives and surroundings. Clowns.... Not 1 has a Brain cell between them.
I.  Fucking.  Love.  This.
A larger collection of incompetent idiots I've never seen.
This is genius.
In before this blows up
Gollum appearance @ 05:55
#JusticeForJackie
Fantastic, you could not write this stuff down.
This is hilarious 🤣 😂😂😂
this is absolutely phenomenal
I don't get it, is that dude doing the Gollum voice intentionally?
“Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on” 😂😂
"I object that someone in the Brewington household was laughing like a hyaena."
There's some good people on hpc. You can tell which ones aren't though...!
Well, that was a very good example of bullying - within Cheshire East - and the environs.
Fucking amazing.
THIS MEETING HAS NOT BEEN CALLED ACCORDING TO THE LAW
Team Jackie vs. Team Aled. Place your bets.
"Fuck off" @ 0:11
Sad to think that some people probably get business cards printed saying they're on the Handforth Parish Council Planning and Environment Committee. I have, and I'm not even on it.
Now going viral thanks to Sebastian Payne!  This is gold!!!😂😂
Omg hilarious 😂😂😂
Nice to see local government in Merseyside working as well as ever.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Easily the best and funniest thing I've seen all year. Even The Thick Of It can't touch this. Hilarious.
"I TAKE CHARGE!" What a prick
READ THE STANDING ORDERS. READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM!
6 minutes in, welcome to Jackie. Who has already kicked the chair out
Hopefully not much tax payers money is wasted on this utter nonsense.
This is the single greatest video I've seen
HahahahahahahH
The way Jackie Weaver's name is scattered through the opening dialogue is really just such a perfect copy of The Thick of It. Baftas all round!
its amazing how little power can go to peoples head
This is absolutely amazing. Thank god Parish councils don't have any real power.
4:08 I swear thats Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith!
You have no authority here, Jackie Weaver
