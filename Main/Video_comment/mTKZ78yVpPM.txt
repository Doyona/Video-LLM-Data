Make a standing desk with wheels that has integrated cable management
Just that one room took them 4 days? I could of done that on my own in 1
You should do a small setup under the stairs, that’s for voiceover work, so any voiceover stuff you need to do, a small hidey hole it will be out the way, and you can put the soundproofing all over the walls and door, and seal, think that’s a cool idea, great video once again!
Love seeing your thought process and seeing how this is going, exciiiited
This man is going to be the next Casey Niestat
Hi i want to ask anyone know what chair is it? 9:11
I do enjoy the updates, rather than 1 big one, but let's be honest Kon, what you're really thinking is "more videos means more moolah" 😂  He knows how to play the game. Well played sir.
Kon can you give me reply on Instagram pleasee
I think you should create a separate channel something like "Konstantin Builds". This way it keeps your content organised and you can vlog and prat about on one and build on one. I love them types of videos ❤️👍
great video!
looking forward to seeing how it looks when its done!
When’s gym pt2
Put Wheels on the rooms, so they can move around and change the space whenever you like
How much will everything cost?
🔥🔥🔥
He has such a soothing voice
Man has done so many setup just to train for his new studio
Kon do you think there’s is anything similar to square space but cor app developing ??
Love that youre turning this into a series. Keep us posted with all these big plans of yours 😁
since he hit 1m subs his content has got better
Love these videos -I’m not a robot 😭
He didn’t even get it to 10 minutes. 1 second off!🤣
those sill plates for the walls don't look to be pressure treated....
6:13 the calves looking amazing kon
is this for him or for the sidemen?
2:30 u rsss
Love it already Kon can’t wait to see more updates
Think you meant j cole
I hope you do a video of all the sidemen boys and a bunch of other people to react to the new studio when it's finished, I'd love to see that. Like them being blindfolded and walking in or something
studio and kon looking good
Ayo finish the gym video
Where’s the insulation
Bro where are the set ups videos
Yo kon ur calves r looking bear leng u know
Thats so cool like u building it from 0 come on kon
Did he just say Kid room
wheels on desks? this is why there are more wheels than doors
Can't wait for you to revolution-arise the industry Kon! 😂
I love this series 🔥🔥
Don’t spray paint the walls use a roller and black paint. Your welcome!!!
Put a temporary security camera in a corner of the building to overlook the project all day and then you get a full time lapse of everything without having much work and I think it would be a sick pov
Your voice looks like u r ill and need some rest Kon and still u r doing all the works..well done man!!
This was really sick especially with the second floor idea!
Maaaaaaaate!  I cannot wait to see more updates!
Wait wait wait. Kon, what about... Wheels on the building?? Like that you wheel the building to the customer, instead of the customer going to your building. Pretty genius, right? Right?
So we ignoring the fact that Kon referred J Cole as Drake?
It’s coming along well but as a carpenter myself they are taking the piss. Also if you’re planning on having stuff on top get them to put a header on the door opening
IS IT YOUTUBE TV📺 STUDIO 🎦🎦🎦 LOOKS LIKE A APARTMENT 🎦🎦🎦
you could use the eaves of the mezzanine floor for built in storage too :)
Take a shot every time Kon says “Here” 😂
Cool 😎
KON IT'S RIDICULOUS HOW HARD WORKING YOU ARE! YOU DO SOO MUCH FOR EVERYONE AROUND YOU! 🔥🔥🔥
Great video Kon! Maybe you could have a meeting room to hold video discussions with a massive whiteboard.
I’m sorry but Kons calves when stepping down the ladder 🤯6:10
Is this a sidemen studio?
Can you do an update for the gym ?
Yeh bro for real, keep making content like this and you're clear. Solid video, very informative and enjoyable! Hope you're enjoying making it
Love the content but it kills me when the video ends I need more
Where is Ksi’a setup
Can’t wait for the other lads setup👍
Bro, pls built a hidden man cafe on 2nd floor 👋👋
Bro how much you pay for all that wood🤣 few ££££ worth there surely, so expensive atm
love the video
Bro this is gonna be insane!
Love the videos. Just to let you know those sockets aren’t in the correct cable zones. If you Google, cables zones it will show you. Hope this helps!!
From someone who use to do wood framing 2 people 4 days (8 people days) I would of been sacked! A bit of wire feeding and a basic room 🤯. I could of welded and cut it out of metal framing in less time! I really hope it’s family or friends and you knew it would take a while.
Nah someone did not just hammer a screw into the floor. That’s just wrong
New drinking game: take a shot every time Kon says “here” 😂 greetings from Costa Rica 🇨🇷
The mezzanine floor sounds great! Keep up the good work kon. Excited to see the end product
man this is insane .. i hope one day i could have a sick art space/ studio like this 🔥🔥😍
4:54 voice crack
Need wheels on a whole mini set 👀 portable set components whenever you need it - foliage panels, wooden background? Wheel it onto set
Use chalk paint so u can draw on it too
wheels on standing desks are a thing on more less every company website
3:27 cool edit
1:00 that would be neat
nice vid
That Leg Muscle Tho. 6:13. W Vid Kon 🔥
Looking forward to see the progress
Im so proud of you man. This new studio is gonna be sickkkkkk!
Huge W
Minecraft ideas 😂😭💀
When's the next Editing Kontest?
good luck on the new studio ( doubt that u need help since u are talented but still :) ) is there any toilet planned?
Love the updates, I think set backgrounds on wheels would be handy and space saving
Looks great but you need a vapor barrier underneath those bottom timber studs or use a pressure treated stud for the bottom
p2 of gym?
Looks good so far. But i'm guessing it's gonna take a lot of power for a good airflow and to keep the temperature cool😅
that electrician needs the sack🤣
Sorry but did you really try hammering in a screw
Won’t be surprised if kon puts wheels on the warehouse so he can film wherever he wants to go
why not take the wheels concept one step further? AN ENTIRE SET ON WHEELS!
Kon so many people need there set ups from you the way you produce the videos and explain everything is class your on another level
Kon gonna level up the whole sidemen production. Love it!
the studio updates are gonna be KON WEDNESDAYS XD
yo this is coming along so nice Kon !!!
my anxiety levels when Kon was on the roof 📈
I’m loving the updates on the studio build, can’t wait to see the final layout and the end product. 👍🏼
With the extra space you could review and display tech, display the tech that gets the kon approval, or you all and gaming room to create a new style of content if you wanted
Yes kon laa
Love your videos man 😍
Excited for this Kon!!!! Hope to see more of this series
congrats kon!
This guy is the backbone of sidemen
So so sick! 🙌🏻
One of the most hardworking guy in the industry.....keep it up my g
Class

Just when I needed you KON !
