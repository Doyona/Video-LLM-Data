My grandpa got his hand chopped off and thankfully reattached but only the medical bills were paid for and nothing else(this was a long time ago obviously) which is stupid as fuck
Ah, the good old times when John Oliver could still talk about people dying due to negligence and greed, and not about how russiаn interference basically destroyed US democracy by appointing the dumbest human ever, and the country imploded.
Not much has changed since The Jungle…
I worked in a meatpacking plant while going to college. It was horrible.  The way the animals and people are treated is criminal.  I didn't eat meat for 10 years. It seems that nothing has changed.
These people who allow our lifestyle through their blood sweat and tears and let me emphasize that I live off of chicken do I need to switch to pork  I mean wtf
“We’re Family” universal covert code for “and probably like your actual really bad dysfunctional family we think we have the right to needlessly exploit and abuse you to an absurd degrees with impunity!”’
Another reason to be Vegan😊
No wonder I stopped watching you
The USA???🦂🤮👎🤑🤑🤑🦂🦂🪱🪳🖕
Not shocking at all. Most companies are scaling back and cutting things like breaks. Its an endless battle. Full time jobs with benefits being converted to part time jobs with no benefits
How many in the Maga/"they took our jobs"/"build the wall" crowd would actually do jobs like those in meat processing/packing, construction work, farm work, lawn care/home improvement work etc. in equally horrid conditions if push came to shove?  I'll wait…
All meatpacking workers should join a union.
EAT ORGANIC!!!
The sad reality is, if you slow down their production, they will pass on the loss of money to the customers so they can keep their 50 billion dollar a year profit
this just feels wrong without the laughing audience
Sounds like fowl play to me...😢
This is why I barely eat meat anymore, and lacking money to get that local farm money.
a country that gives so little in legal protection is a third world country. matters not how technological the population may be.
A Box on her head? wow
Red state shit 😂😂😂
I’m watching this in the year 2024 where Tyson foods just fired 12k American employees in order to hire 45k asylum seekers who are technically not American citizens. So much for being a “family” company.
Everybody should stop calling "lobbying" that. It's bribing. It's corruption.
Funny - where I live working in a meatworks is a pretty good job.
If companies are "family," then they are borderline abusive.
why are you fighting for rights of illegal workers and not for the real americans? biden voters. lolol
I wish I could be interviewed! I have worked for two of the biggest chicken companies (Tyson and George’s) and I have so much dirt. There is literally a Marshallese graveyard that filled up during Covid because of those companies. They either caught it there, from being forced to work with sick people, or brought it home, to their elderly and children. It happened to one of the largest populations of Marshallese people in the WORLD. Their immune systems are weakened because of what we did to their land, and the companies said they had to show up or lose their livelihood, even though other employees were showing up sick and some even refused to wear masks. They did nothing to help or protect these people.   I have personally witnessed (and reported) their management making fun of their Marshallese and Hispanic employees, and actively discriminating against them. I hate those places.
Ahh JBS, "Just Bull S" for their standards as a whole. With how they treat the product they sell to other companies, not following standards that are expected of their product, I'm not surprised the workers are treated so poorly.
Pesticides concentration not great for vegetarians but meat antibiotics too
the fact purdue payed for that meat ad is hilarious like red flag
Ive never worked for tysen but cargill amd smithfield treat there staff great

How do we get ethical and intelligent leaders and scientist in charge of things?  Why is it always the old evil people who get elected elected?
My own especialist. He knows what a specialist is and why he needs one but he cant say the word.
As soon as someone starts pitching this whole family shtick, that means they want to underpay and overwork you to oblivion.
thank you, John Oliver -- factory farming is barbaric to everyone -- those who "live" in disgusting conditions and are then murdered, the humans who process the corpses, and the surrounding environment -- i have been vegan since around 2000?  2001? (but had already been going in the vegetarian direction since the mid-1980s) -- not only is it a crash course in what is really in your food (bc you are always reading ingredient labels), but how that food gets to your plate -- i was already involved with other issues (vivisection, high-kill "shelters," fur, etc.), and the more i learned, the more i not only wanted no part of that system, but i needed to work towards abolishing this "industry" altogether . . . i read Fast Food Nation in the mid-2000s, and there is a lot about the human cost of factory farming -- horrible injuries, abuses of workers -- and iirc, if a worker is undocumented, they are not able to get any sort of disability, workers comp., etc.  . . . more recently, through ALDF (Animal Legal Defense Fund), i learned about CAFOs (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations), which release all sorts of toxins and pollution from massive quantities of animal waste into the water, air, soil -- the surrounding communities may be on beautiful lands, but the humans who live there (mostly poor, mostly Black and brown) suffer tremendously -- even something as simple as opening one's windows for some "fresh air" is not really possible, nor is going outside without some sort of respiratory mask
The worst job I ever had was in a Tyson chicken plant in Clarksville, AR. Horrible place to work. I still have scars all over my thumbs and pointer fingers from knife cuts. At one's point I witnessed a girl on our Evis line accidentally stab herself in the leg, badly. Then during our 15 minute break go into the womans locker room and put a tampon into the wound to stop the bleeding and so that she wouldn't be sent to the nurse, which would result in a drug test. I'd say over half of us were on drugs and you kinda had to be.   I'm surprised John didn't talk about how Tyson brings over young Asian families and put them to work, using their home countries labor laws. Therefore, way lower wages and way more hours. At one point at my plant they would have them also sign NDAs regarding their work contracts so, for the ones who spoke English, they wouldn't know how badly they were being fucked.
Is this some kind of apologism for factory farming?
In the US it`s Tyson, in Germany it`s Tönnies, why is it that these companies always start with a "T"? omg... Tesla? Could it be?
Its almost like in the 1900's a book about meat packing with the title being about a forest i think? Talked about the horrifying conditions in meat packing plants with the main character being a poor Lithuanian man, and who at the ends goes to a meeting about smth i forgot. Meh its not important and maybe we shouldve democratized the work place instead of putting a plaster on it and costing the american people (at the time 30 million dollars) a year because it just raised the prices of goods and the taxes of people to fund the food and drug administration but i think im mistaken🤷‍♂️.
The ghost Upton Sinclaire: “wait a sec? we've been here before haven't we?”
They didn't even cover the child labor, that is done within many of these factories.
Is Purdue here the same Purdue that made Oxycodone?
I think it is funny that so many Americans think of Covid as a period of isolation. For many of us, maybe most, that isn't what it was. Medical personnel, first responders, restaurant workers, grocery workers, and a hell if a lit more of us had to work like usual, with the added benefit of maybe dying of Covid. Don't get me wrong, I am sure the isolation was hard to deal with. I just feel like it was the best of the two options. I was a DM for a chain that served coffee and donuts. How the hell was it essential that we be at work?  The argument we got was that not everyone could cook their own meals. Yeah, sure, true. How many people that are incapable of cooking their own meals are capable of driving to a restaurant?
Sometimes when you see the suffering of the animals, you kind of forget of what the workers have to go through.
Upton Sinclair is rolling in his grave.
Hot take: while the supply side of capitalism undoubtedly takes advantage of the system, people, and animals, so does the demand side to some extent. As consumers, we have a responsibility (though it can be argued to what degree) to reduce mass consumption that drives these types of company demands for production (and mass murder both of poultry every minute and humans via COVID exposure).
Namaste is a Hindu greeting not a new-age punchline.                         I love this show, love John Oliver. just trying to correct some misinformation/oversight
So I don't know about the rest if the industry but I worked for a company called Indiana Packers and they are were very good during the pandemic. It is fast paced work but if you work for a good company it's a good job. P.S. we got a 10 to 15 minute bathroom break every session. A session generally lasts about 2 to 2 1/2 hours. And they have fre medical provided by the company including free prescription meds and they offer some of the industries best insurance.  Just wanted you to know they aren't all bad.
At Tyson we called it the “fat” tax. If you were part of management and was overweight, high blood pressure, diabetic or a nicotine user you could have $100 taken out of your paycheck because you were unhealthy.
the skeevy look on the face of that owl...
What's a "blank 10,000$ check"? Was it a blank check,or a check worth 10,000$ or,was it a blank check,which was then only used for 10,000$,because that guy who used it couldn't think of a larger number?
as a health and safety representative in Denmark at a meat packaging facility, this video made me realise how good we have it. We have a lot of work to do in making conditions proper here, but at least the managers listen, care about people and allow fucking bathroom breaks.
This is very similar to how the solar companies in Fresno, Ca treat their construction and installation workers and their injuries.
Ffs man can u stop making me realise ppl r horrible and just make me laugh without hating everyone else
John you sexy owl
Eh, I wouldn’t tell him “no”.
While I appreciate and have learned more about meat processing, there is also the consumer factor. We demand enormous amounts of meat from the meat companies. We want more, want more different cuts, expect there to be always product on the shelves, etc. As long as we have our meat as a nation we don't care how it gets to the shelf.
You know who else calls you family when you are making them rich? Gangsters and drug suppliers. That’s until you don’t make them money anymore.
Glad that these videos can finally be informative again when they aren't just blaming everything on the Orange donut. Please don't become 2016 John Oliver if he wins again. The only reason Trump wins is because his competition is just that bad.
Two+ years and recent laws later: I'm here to review the conditions we are now allowing kids as young as 14 (or was it 12?) to work in.
This would be destroyed in court. It will never be in court because this people will never have access to a lawyer. Lawyers are dirty cheap to train, only requiring lecturers and books; no labs whatsoever. But even liberal lawyers lobby against new unis with a fake concern for the quality of lawyers.
"While a perverted owl... Looks on..." Are you the perverted owl, John? You are, aren't you?
I'm not surprised the meat packing industry is so bad when they LITERALLY THE INDUSTRY FROM THE JUNGLE (you know, the book about how evil and exploitive capitalism is)
my grandma lost his hand which he got reattached then died of a heart attack in the shower years and years later
I don't miss that family talk bullshit not one bit.
One of the first workers reports in American history was about the horrific conditions in meat packing plants. The takeaway from that article wasn’t to improve workers conditions, so much is “wait, what the fuck are they putting in my sausage?!”
Everytime I hear an employer say "We'Re A fAmIlY" I vomit a little bit. Every boss who thinks that acts like the patriarch of a fucking gang where only his word is true, no one is allowed to disagree with him and he knows everything better than you. Fuck family businesses
I'm so lazy I'm considering whether I should start using adult diapers. I heard John say workers using diapers, and it was like I had an epiphany from which I needed to walk myself back.
JBS is a Brazilian company....
Brooks, Alberta has a large population of immigrants, some of them don't speak English and don't understand their rights. They are the most hired workers at the meat processing plant. Awful conditions
you absolutely know there will be worker explotation when that term family is thrown around by a corporation.
*This* sort of thing is why I start foaming at the mouth every time some Fox News puppet starts with the "oh noes, the entitlement these days!!" or  "nobody wants to work anymore".
I love John Oliver he has a huge heart and knows how to talk shit where it counts. Best combination
Time to break up the meat packing oligopoly
Anyone working for the meat industries deserve to suffer.
With pigeons, you just have to act confident. Maybe yell at them a little. Trust me, it works, I'm smaller than John Oliver, but with my superior attitude, the pigeons know not to mess with me.
Fuck JBS yo They trade beef with Brazil, Brazil doesn’t give a fuck about where the beef is coming from and they slash down the rainforest for there cows that they sell to the US. That’s right, if you eat JBS, you support the destruction of the Amazon and it’s your fault.
Æ
Sometimes he is so in a hurry to get to the ... punchline that he isn't paying attention to what is being said; "get out from behind your desk and stretch ..." doubt this has anything to do with the people on the Line ... so yes, though the company has implemented such a program it really is just for the overweight secretaries ... no add on joke needed
I want to go back to learning about the Horse Poet :(
Idk man your mom is the most important thing in life
America should care for workers in the meatpacking industry the way John Oliver loves Judi Dench.
Of course John Oliver will never run as story about the conditions that animals are kept in OR the climate repercussions that are intrinsically linked to meat production . . .
This right here is why I hunt. It's cleaner, and it doesn't line the pockets of people who put humans and animals in horrible conditions.
*grins and yawns at your attention
I have two things to say about any meat company. Learn to cook your food. Learn to cook your food now really now like right now proper temperatures are quaintly appropriate.
*pre positioned to smile immediately
Murica, fuck yeah, again, no idea why not a lot more people in charge get murdered in Murica.
what a grim world we live in.
If you really want to puke, read Upton Sinclair's book, "The Jungle". It's about the horrors of the meatpacking industry during the turn of the century in Chicago. Workers would slip and fall into the lard rendering vats; and would get ground into sausages later on. Sinclair's work is not fiction.
I think that John Oliver as hilarious as he is, is my favourite journalist.   I know that he's not going into physically dangerous places and reporting from war zones but he's a British man who is uncovering the important and insane truths in America.   He is a citizen there now.
No words 💔😢

As someone who's lived in Texas for most of his life the phrase "I don't think he was trying to give me a Christmas present" is the most Texas way of saying he tried to bribe me.
JBS Packerland pulled this shit with me... pretty sure I have carpal tunnel or pre-arthritis in my hands. When I was injured, they just applied ointment and told me I couldn't see a doctor. -_-
If your employees are your family, you should be put away for domestic abuse.
Hey thats cool. I am learning about the meat packing industry in history
when it comes to regulating corporate America, our government is about as effective as a tortoise on a post.
I love meat  I love chicken wings.
Maple Lodge Farms, Maple Leaf line speeds are at anywhere from 220-280 birds per minute.
Purdue and other companies like ruin lives, ptsd, workplace injuries, drug, alcohol abuse. Mostly marginalized workers. Disgusting. Not to mention what animals go through and the risk to the publics health.
How do you get a blank 10,000$ check?  It's either blank, or it's for 10k, can't be both 😆
I have no problem w the Tyson betting pool.  It's not like they bet on deaths or maimings.
Yet another reason why I buy most of the meat I cook from a local, Halal butcher. Local business, treats employees well, and higher standards than the USDA. The pork comes from a different, local butcher shop, obviously...
Don't vote for assholes who dismantle institutions. Please.
Racist Tyson y a fiking arrow 4 obvious reasons and many mesoamerican migrants are native plus being the largest refugee and prison pop. Salt 2 a gaping wound
I read a book quite a while ago called "Methland" and how the drug world and meat packing plants are related more than you could ever imagine. This confirms the horrible conditions are still prevalent. :(
The "first aid only" bullshit happens at a lot of companies. I've worked occupational health and have seen companies try to keep injuries off of their OSHA log. It's terrible and it has actual negative outcomes for the injured employee physically, mentally, and financially.
I really think that during this period of the show it should have cut back on the jokes. Or found a different way to present them. Without a studio audience it can seem jarring. I'm sure with a different format it could have worked.
Lobbies for any kind of industry should be straight-up illegal. Giant companies or vested interests should _not_ be able to basically pay to bend the law in their favor. It'd make actual good lobbies go away but it's the giant money-making people who tend to pay to win anyway.
As a guinea pig owner, the commercial is 100% absolutely factual, if I open the refrigerator and don't feed them produce.
the guinea pig of caerbannog...
I have watched enough of these Oliver segments to say, FUCK THIS COUNTRY.  Sick and tired of our government being bought and paid for by corporate and private business SCUM.
You talk about meat packing plants taking advantage of felons and immigrants, but there aren't many "second chance" companies willing to give those people a decent paying job. I think they're doing a great service to our country in providing those opportunities.
Human rights. That’s going to be my response next time I’m pestered for being vegan.
I was just reading a summary of Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle". Not that much has changed in the 116 years since its publication.   Until money and special interests are removed from politics (which I cannot imagine could ever occur with the existing political and economic system) the abusers will continue to run the world.
America is not a very good ad for "democracy".
Bo Pilgrim looks like a funky chicken-human-parakeet hybrid
How about meat eaters an disease. Diabetes All processed meat is listed as a carcenogen
A “blank check” is when you can fill in the amount yourself.
Was that check blank? Or was it for $10 000?
The system is a joke
Check into how many people work for the FDA... yeah... It will scare you...
Yeah. JBS treat their employees like fucking shit.
Get to stay in the comfy drawer and come out once a week to robot fuck a soup! 😅😅😅😂😂🤣🤣
So who won? Rhetorical. Just kidding really do not want to know.
If company execs treat their company like a "family," I'm afraid for their actual families
Ah, meat packing! What I think about every Saturday night
11:15 Looks more like a peacock and a peahen (two peafowl) to me.
Fraction of a FÜ¢K. Horrible
This guy is Fucking Awesome! He says "Holy Shit!" At least once per video and he makes a joke out of terrible news stories. Lol! 😂
Bull
We need UNIONS!!!!!!!!
I worked at Tyson and many meat packing plants in my area. Tyson is by far, the ABSOLUTE WORST PLACE TO WORK! They do not care at all about their employees. I have watched them drag undocumented, pregnant workers from the line because they passed out and just left them there in the isle. My plant had well over 100 people working under the same social security number. They were turned in. But because of the laws in Indiana, nothing happened to them. They just paid off a few locals and they locked the other way.
nice
we're doomed
99% of the things about meat industry are inadmissible. I’ll leave the solution for you think about.
For the life of God is living under the order of 73 the nation is under the depression of this same number...... You voted for the son of a b**** or it just fell in line but too bad you got it.... ... Can you f****** calculate how many people are underneath this same number you will know your f****** damage stop acting like you don't know how to f****** add
Of course they only care about their white employees, the ones that sit at fucking desks all fucking day  It was already abundantly clear how fucked shit is, and how little they actually care about the employees that matter
so NO ONE is gonna say ANYTHING about 10:06? 😭 🎩
None if this is new.  Read The Jungle but Upton Sinclair.  This industry hasn't changed much since the 1800's
What can we do? Break out chains. Storm every single corporate office. Eat the rich, figuratively or literally if you want. Enshrine in law for perpetuity Workers Rights. Empower OSHA, give them actual funding and manpower. Eat the rich.
This is another job that should be done entirely by robots.
If a company says you are family, RUN!
the meatpacking industry needs unions now
any company that says theyre a family that means working for it is absolute shit, they just dont respect the worker/employer relationship.
This is where all our grocery stores are heading. If you buy meat at Walmart, aldis, Lidell, stop& shop etc you are supporting these meat packing plants and putting grocery store level meat cutters out of work. If you don't see a meat counter with butchers in the back don't buy your meat there. Store level meat cutters are often unionized and have great pay and benefits and better yet youll get better quality and fresher meat. I know this because my fiance is one but his job is under attack as more and more grocery stores are shutting down their meat departments and turning to pre-packaged meat coming from conditions like these.
Sometimes you just wish the us and the soviets took eachouter out
Go vegan to not support this shit.
I'm starting to see vegans' and vegetarians' points
Hourly is better then salary. Salary can be abused vía over time.
Oh, so meatpacking basically has the same work conditions as a MacBook repair warehouse. Neato.
Maybe workers could be considered family if the company were non-hierarchical and they actually had a democratic say in company decisions. Or, y'know, if they were taken care of at all like family.
So sad.  What can we do?
"Horrible things our country is doing to us, with John Stewart"
I worked for Amazon Flex, I didn't play that crap; if I had to go I went. However, the app gave me insufficient hours and eventually stopped sending work (not sure if they still do anything with private cars, I think it's all franchisees making minimum wage now.)
So like ceo fails its workers he gets killed and replaced not a new job a second chance or a paycut or a demotion fuck a fine your gonna pay with life. Im sure if death was the outcome for speaking out of turn im sure it wouldnt happen or at least it would help the situation. No??
Just kill the bosses man. If people associate death with doing the wrong thing im sure it wouldnt happen you cant make money when your dead
Bruh just another reason the meat industry is dispicable
I’m going through a divorce and my sons name is Billy I feel special
Wait until you hear most osha fines settle for way less if they are paid without dispute.
Washington State has an amazing WC program. Even coveres COVID for frontline/essential workers and healthcare workers
Just stop eating meat. Catch up with modern society and keep yourself updated.
The medical facility is also on the money . They have a phoney medical room pretty much only with bio freeze and like the lady said bengay or some icy hot, straight capitalism boys this is the system working perfectly. Chewing up poor and vulnerable people and spitting them out when they're no longer useful. Pretty obvious it's all a part of the same vicious cycle , create damaged people who can't work , steadily raises homeless population, jail those homeless for being homeless . Now we got a slave we pay pennies the day picking up garbage on the freeway. American dream baby
I worked for. JBS in Utah for a short time till my hand contracted carpal tunnel from wearing three layers of gloves and gripping for 10 hours a day. They just let me go the same day. No warning or anything and told me that I had the injury before I worked here and didn't mention. Which wasn't true. I've never had to wear 3 pair of gloves before . Demons run those company . The poor people are working in those facilities are just hard working people who can't do any better and just take what they can get
Good news! They're closing the plants in the USA, and outsourcing the jobs to China and South America. So now, those workers are now unemployed. Problem solved.
We get it John, you are a big, big furry. Thanks for sharing.
If I wasn't an atheist I'd say John Oliver is out here doing God's work. He's the true defender of the common place human being.
Oh, but she can see these conditions occurring in other countries? That’s pretty telling.
Please please please, do a story on Inflation.
You may have money, but do you have "wall-high picture of peacocks fucking" money?
Go vegan.
I was expecting to say pets before family too 😂
What?! That foyer is dope
I kinda like the show more without the audience I'm sure I'm in the minority about this but I feel like the point gets driven home harder without people laughing
This is the story of the Asian empire and it's growth continuity from the day's of Ghangis Khan.
Stuff like this is why I say we’re living in another Gilded Age
When Karl Marx spoke at length about capitalists abusing the working class, I didn't understand why he was so angry. Now, after watching this episode, I fully understand why Karl Marx spoke at length about the need for workers to unite against cruel abuse from the factory owners.
I’m going to add this to the long list of reasons I’m glad I’m a vegetarian…
I wish HR Giger were alive to build the turn of the 20th century Chicago Stockyards sets for my dream rock opera production of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle...feel free to DM me if this idea resonates with you...
wow  i think i just became a vegan
"OinkHub"
You know it'll bad when the first clip shown is an employee video with some sleazy dude saying you're in his family
It makes me sad that he can be so outraged, and still not be vegan.
Were family. Maybe a dysfunctional one?
All thanks to the party of anti-, regulation....Murica 🙄  So many of the white workers there are voting for the politicians in those red states that strip regulation because they tell them is about "freedom"
Read the book “The Jungle” by Upton Sinclair.
For two thirds of the population America is a failed state. This is the kind of stuff you read about during the labor movements of the early 20th century. By all rights people should be flipping over street cars
Unions will solve these problems.
This is honestly the biggest reason to buy local / bio meat.
I heard that office which labels themselves as family is a red flag. I experienced it first hand and I am not generalizing. Some only use that word just to encourage applicants or just because they don't have other words to say. Key is we all act professional and decent with each other.
Go vegan. Don’t support the exploitation of people or animals.
We shouldn't be surprised that companies running slaughterhouses for profit treat their human counterparts this way. Eating meat in developed countries is outdated and disgusts me.
This show makes me hate humanity. Why are we so fucking awful?
That hamster commercial is amazing and I am glad I saw this.
I’m always surprised at how surprised americans are that this kinda shit happens in their beloved country. The place is a mess in so many areas, how are you still shocked by any of this? 🙄
just shows how messed up America is
My dad once packed chicken for Pilgrim's Pride, and he was treated like shit. They stuck him with people who would not communicate, and were pushed to speed up to a point where my dad once had bruises and come home with cuts and welts on his body. They're a horrible company, and my dad left after a month.
When a company says "we're like a family here" they don't mean you'll be treated with compassion and respect. They mean "We're the parents and you'll do everything we say without question or we will beat you or disown you"
My dream job is any job where I don’t need a diaper because I can’t otherwise go to the bathroom
Did Mr. Perdue think that commercial was a good idea? It was entertaining, and slightly terrifying, but the last thing it made me was hungry.
I thought I was going to have a hard time reading Gail Eisnitz' book Slaughterhouse, but as soon as I started reading, I was drawn into this "shocking story of greed, neglect, and inhumane treatment inside the U.S. meat industry." Eisnitz really does tell a story. The reader is plunged into a world it is hard to believe exists, unless, like Eisnitz, we choose to enter this terrible place, or we are forced, or feel forced, to be there. The book starts out like a novel or a movie that sets a chill in your heart in the very first scene. You enter the spiritual universe of In Cold Blood and Deliverance. Here we have it: a vulnerable woman in a world of violent men. A savvy woman courting danger, terrified, running for her life, keeping her wits, a smart chick. "Carol Taylor" is a fake name--the undercover identity of "I, Gail Eisnitz," who is boldly sneaking around in Florida chasing down a notorious animal abuser for arrest. Her search leads her to the Slaughterhouse. Years ago, when I first started learning about the things humans do to animals on farms and in laboratories, wondering if I could endure this information, Peter Singer answered my question. In Animal Liberation, he said that if the animals must go through this in reality, the least we can do is to go through it in our minds.  The Ninth Circle of Hell in Slaughterhouse is the kill floor.  Consider a horse who doesn't want to die. "'You can't spend fifteen or twenty minutes on one horse. You have to do whatever you can to get him in that box to get him skinned--fast. You can't let one horse stop you from making money.'"  (Later) "'What about the inspector?' I asked. 'Does he ever see any of this?'  "'Yes.'  "'How do you know? You've seen him?'  "'We all on the kill floor together,' he said, 'we all watching this. Sometimes he'd complain about it. But you've got a lot of guys there, new, unexperienced, and they think it's a game.'"  Pick almost any place in Slaughterhouse, and you've got testimony, an eyewitness who is soaked in blood reciting the facts, reenacting the daily ritual. Eisnitz documents alcoholism, anger, misery, murder, fear, family violence, callousness, sadism, compassion, jail time, prison sentences--the slaughterhouse milieu including the "good times." One of the book's benefits is the range of attitudes and self-revelations elicited by Eisnitz. It reminds me of what a student of mine once said about an essay we were reading: "The author said that he wasn't commenting, merely stating facts. However, his facts were full of comments."  For me, the heart of the book is the interview with Ed Van Winkle, a pig-sticker described by men who have worked with him as "the most ferocious of the stickers." He says, "'The worst thing, worse than the physical danger, is the emotional toll. If you work in that stick pit for any period of time, you develop an attitude that lets you kill things but doesn't let you care. You may look a hog in the eye that's walking around down in the blood pit with you and think, God, that really isn't a bad-looking animal. You may want to pet it. Pigs down on the kill floor have come up and nuzzled me like a puppy. Two minutes later I had to kill them--beat them to death with a pipe. I can't care.'"  The book focuses on mammals, rather than on the birds who make up the 95 percent of animals slaughtered for food. (While 35 million cattle are slaughtered each year in the United States, 35 million chickens are slaughtered every day.) However, Slaughterhouse does provide a lot of information about the poultry industry, as in these comments by inspectors Macias and Carney:  "'Poultry is exempt from coverage under the Humane Slaughter Act, right?' I asked.  "'Correct,' Carney said. 'It's not humanely slaughtered. Because they're going into the scald tanks still alive, breathing and sucking in the water.'  "Macias nodded. 'Most of them are still alive when they go into that tank and they fill their lungs. That's a reason for the high contamination.'  "'The kicker,' Carney said, 'is that when that chicken is exported to Canada, inspectors have to sign off on an export certificate that says it's been humanely slaughtered. We have no control over how they're slaughtered. None whatsoever.'  The point is that "laws" or no laws, mammals and birds alike are tortured to death and anything goes in this environment. There's a kind of macabre humor in the way the cast of characters either couldn't care less about, cannot implement, and often is not even aware of the federal "humane slaughter" law for livestock. In any case, "violations of the Humane Slaughter Act carry no penalties at all."  In trying to do justice to Slaughterhouse, I find I can't. There is too much packed into it and the book's sensibility must be experienced directly. There is Eisnitz's cancer while she is doing her investigations, her ordeals with the news media, violent sickness and death from food poisoning, information about the Clinton Administration, and information like this: "'Fat- reduced beef isn't meat,' he [a former USDA inspector] explained. 'It's fatty tissue, the solid part of fat. It's a gray, ugly mass. It makes you sick to look at it. They form it into patties, color it, freeze it--if you leave it out too long it will start to smell--and then they tell you to cook it.'"  Many animals, including their heads, are skinned alive, and rotten chicken flesh is mixed with other meat and sold for baby food. Also, about a hundred individuals are ground up in every hamburger.  Slaughterhouse shows the reader what is happening, without telling us what to do. In a manner akin to the archetype of the Ancient Mariner, Eisnitz has journeyed through hell, "And now I am telling the world." If, vicariously, we could "become" these animals, the workers, and Eisnitz herself, perhaps history would stop repeating itself.  About the Author: Gail A. Eisnitz is a cruelty investigator for the Humane Farming Association, San Francisco, CA. What started out, with a single complaint about a Florida slaughterhouse turned into a tale of intrigue and suspense as investigator Gail A. Eisnitz unearthed more startling information about the meat and poultry Americans consume. This shocking story follows Eisnitz as she becomes submerged in a slaughterhouse subculture, venturing deeper and deeper into the lives of the workers.  As the stakes become higher in her David-and-Goliath-type battle, this determined young woman finds herself courageously taking on one of America's most powerful industries. Slaughterhouse takes readers on a frightening but true journey from one slaughterhouse to another throughout the country. Along the way we encounter example after example of mistreated animals...intolerable working conditions...lax standards...the slow, painful deaths of children killed as a result of eating contaminated meat...the author's battle with the major television networks...and a dangerously corrupt federal agency that chooses to do nothing rather than risk the wrath of agribusiness...before the whole affair is blown wide open in this powerful expose.  In an effort to understand how such rampant violations could occur right under the noses of U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspectors - the individuals charged with enforcing humane regulations in slaughterhouses - Eisnitz examines the inspectors' track record for enforcing meat and poultry safety regulations, their primary responsibility. Following a long paper trail, she learns that contaminated meat and poultry are pouring out of federally inspected slaughterhouses and, not surprisingly, deaths from foodborne illness have quadrupled in the United States in the lastfifteen years. Determined to tell the whole story, Eisnitz then examines the physical price paid by employees working in one of America's most dangerous industries. In addition to suffering disfiguring injuries and crippling repetitive motion disorders, employees describe tyrannical working conditions in which grievances are met with severe reprisals or dismissals.

This isn't surprising. I was a teacher and had to fight to get my what I needed after I was injured at work because of what they DIDN'T do. My back is now majorly messed up and I'm about to have my 3rd surgery, but I have already taken them to court once and even then they didn't want to admit it was their fault(though I did get a settlement that has since run out.) Worker's Comp is a joke depending on where you are and what you do.

This show needs to be on a news network. Like ABC Sunday night. I only ran into it because I watch the nightly shows on YouTube and this popped up. I wish everybody got to see this show so maybe John can get thru to them.
Bastards!!!
Wow is this late night comedy or a lecture? The only joke here is John Oliver pretending to be funny.
Most noticeably missing from this video is any mention of unions attempting to protect workers or stand up for their rights. Why is that? Perhaps a Part 2 is needed, specifically focusing on that aspect of the modern meat packing industry.
John Oliver: The British Orson Welles.  Hat's off to you, John Oliver!  #BirminghamUKBold
to be fair, tyson managers betting on employees testing positive really fits the "family feel" of the company. I mean how many times have you went to a sibling looking at another sibling doing something stupid and gone "how much you wana bet that this is going to  wrong in a moment"
This is why there is a union at Tyson in Shelbyville TN.
I don't know how anyone can sleep at night after doing any of the thing john Oliver talks about in these video?
You would think that they would be using robots to slice everything.
Truly disgusting behavior from that company, it is a good thing Comrade Oliver can say something without spelling it out so that his capitalist network doesn't drop him
That betting pool is absolutely no surprise to me; it’s Iowa.
Strengthening OSHA: Good idea until the mandate order for vaccination went through. I'm pretty sure 80% of people were okay with rebuilding and strengthening OSHA until that got ruined by Brandon  Laws to protect workers: Should've been in the books for Day 1. Maybe should think about passing these laws through Congress instead of a garbage socialism package  Laws to punish businesses: Could've passed bigger fining terms if Congress wasn't backed up by your liberal spending package
Love this one. The first time I became aware of this topic was when I read "Fast Food Nation." This issue was only one of the subjects the book spoke about, but it was pretty significant. Fortunately, I was living in Sicily at the time, because after reading the book, there was a lot of food I did not want to touch. Some of the things it talked about included the conditions in the plants and the lack of availability for any government agency to do anything about it. There was a part about a USDA agent who shut down a plant. Less than a day later, the plant was open, and the USDA worker was reprimanded and sent to work elsewhere. It made me completely lose faith in the "USDA" label. While I am far from being vegetarian, I strongly support anything that can be done to keep workers safe. Even slowing those lines down would do a lot to help. Even if that meant less product for higher prices, I believe that in the U.S., we consume way too much meat. It's not like I want to give it up, but it definitely wouldn't hurt for most of us to cut back. Who knows, American health could actually improve. Two birds, one stone.
It’s cases like this which makes me wish all the world could become vegetarian or we have food in pill form and I’m an avid meat eater!

Now everyone in that family has rabies and they will either get treated before its to late or die think about that.
Seems to me these companies DO treat their employees like family, assuming the family patriarch is that Covid-denying, Trump-supporting deranged anti-vaxxer uncle who supports cops no matter what and tells everyone "All lives matter". It all makes perfect sense then.  Oh, and animals ≠ food.
I'd swap #2 and #3 on the valued asset list
This is just going to make Tyson replace their employees with robots to cut the chicken. There’s no good solution to this problem
You think the way they treat humans are bad? Good god- if people knew how animals were treated... it is literally hell on Earth  Torture and abuse are NORMAL in animal factories (99% of meat produced in America comes from factory farms) Not a single animal lives a happy life. Not a single one will ever see the light of day. Not a single one will ever know love. Mutilated, force-fed, separated, and slaughtered (if they don't die first)
ANIMAL FACTORIES ARE ABUSIVE DESTRUCTIVE INHUMANE AND DISGUSTING  They are lying scumbags, if there is any reason not to eat meat it is that any meat eating endorses abuse and torture
That was the best commercial ever

Ugh the different treatment between the floor workers (whether its lab, factory, etc) and the admin is fucking DISGUSTING
Its not just them though. My coworkers also wear diapers while we are processing covid samples in BSL3 labs because our bosses wont tell the clients no. We will be unable to leave the bsl3 lab (the ones where you wear basically space suits and ventilators) until work is done so we can be in there from 4-8 hours, so no food, water, or bathroom breaks. This doesnt include how to prevent INHALING COCKROACHES FROM THE TUBES FROM THE LACK OF CLEANLINESS

I keep forgetting the Tysons plant I got myself fired from (after being harassed and overworked for several months and snapping) made national news because of the shitty management during the pandemic

"manager taking bets on how many catch the C virus" is the most out of context thing I ever saw on John Oliver. maybe he's so sure of the anti corona measures in his plant that he thinks at most 5 people will get the virus. maybe he was just bragging I measure how much I like things by how many babies I'm willing to kill for it. not gonna do it, I just say shit like "I would drown 3 babies for a cheeseburger right now." it's not a thing
My dad worked at a Tyson beef plant in Lexington Nebraska for 11 years. He was a gutter. The company is truly terrible. Even on multiple occasions had SUPERVISORS make him send out contaminated meat from actual shit that spilled into the cow. It was regularly 100° and higher inside the plant. He would gut an entire cow every 60 seconds. It did so much damage to his body, its seriously an awful place to work and management was just straight up disgusting.

I am an international student, I work part time in The Netherlands and I study there. I work in a warehouse, distribution for a chain of stores and while work per say sometimes can be very difficult, with high targets and pressure, the second I  thought I saw some sparks and called the supervisor his first worry was if I am hurt, he asked me 7 times if I am sure fine even if we ultimately came to the conclusion that they weren't actually sparks. If I were to be even remotely injured I would have been helped, tend to, sent home and given paid leave. This is in every European country I know. Companies understand the importance of targets but the safety is always more important than anything and not because of some dumb lawsuit but because, at the end of the day, they are people too. Whatever the f happens in USA is beyond my understanding.

I'm kinda wondering how come meat packers haven't unionized in order to fight back against such shitty treatment.
I wouldn't have guessed that someone could try to out-do Amazon with regards to how poorly they treat their employees.
I did security at Tyson for awhile. I hated every moment of it. Those people are so overworked they don’t give a shit about what a security officer has to say. Even if it’s to remind them that we’re in the midst of a pandemic, and they need to wear a mask.

Those white office workers have rights obviously
It's a standard tactic by employers to do everything they can to improve the situation for workers as long as it costs nothing.   But you ask workers what they want, and all those things cost money. Decent wages, healthcare, training that empowers them, safe working conditions.   Which is why it's inexcusable that office workers are being dragged back from remote work, just so middle managers can validate their existence by micromanaging people instead of picking their ears with a pen in an office alone all day.

Now that we have pressed through Covid, this is exactly why people aren’t taking certain low-paying or “unappreciated/easily replaceable” jobs. It’s so sad. Why do we have large inflation? Not enough employees. Why do people not take these jobs? It’s not that people are lazy, it is silent protest. Something drastic is needed not just this industry? But in so…so many. Humans deserve certain rights with employment.
This is like the reverse “Jungle”. Come in expecting a story of bad conditions for the animals, find a story of bad conditions for the workers
This is even harder to stomach considering how much of that food goes to waste. For two weeks this summer I worked for Casey's, a chain of convenience stores in the Midwest, and I was appalled to learn that the kitchen staff has to make enough food so that 23% of it gets thrown away. And in bigger urban areas they are required to dump bleach on their waste in order to deter homeless people from dumpster diving. I fucking hate this country!
In Germany there's a saying "Der Markt regelt das schon" which basically means "I don't care about your health, as long as I make more money" and Christian Lindner thinks it's beautiful.

So on one hand Animals, and humans are treated horribly in the process of making meats which is both animal cruelty, and human rights abuse BUT on the other hand Meat is one of the primary way’s we get protein, and vitamins, and minerals, and if you don’t eat meat the only alternative is supplements otherwise you’ll be extremely unhealthy.  Why should this be an Eye for an Eye situation?
"LIKE FAMILY" ..Hmmm.....kinda like "I'm not lying, I swear. I'm not lying, really, I'm not!" How I know when my 6 yr old IS lying....
Wowzers, eye opening. 🤯I wonder if there is a company out there that doesn't treat its workers like that?  I'd love to switch.
I wholeheartedly disagree... Being shoved into dark, confined spaces and then occasionally dunked into boiling water and vegetables sounds terrifying and I would only be an immersion blender if the only other option was being a meatpacker.

One thing I'd never considered about the US not having a national health service is that in Spain when we get sick we go to the doctor and the doctor tells you if you are allowed to work or not. It's not up to you or your employer but a medical professional. If the doctor gives you the 'baja' then you get paid untill the doctor says you can work again.
Why in the hell is the line speed doubled since the 70's if the wage hasn't moved?
Back where I used to live in western Kentucky, Tyson has been setting up shop with chicken processing facilities.  The rancid smell of these facilities can be smelled for literally miles.  Just imagine trying to grill your Tyson chicken outside with the most terrible stench, which smells like a corpse farm operating from visual distance from your back porch.  A guy who worked at one of these facilities died when he fell into a vat of waste.  It was said at his funeral, you could still smell the stench of the chicken farm on him.

I wonder how the widows lawsuit went. Anyone know?
John, you're about 100 years too late. Upton Sinclair already did an expose on the meat-packing industry, and in his words "I aimed for the nation's heart and hit it's stomach." I worry for your safety (and citizenship status, not necessarily in that order) about you. The US government has overthrown democratically elected governments when the policies of said governments were too generous to workers. Iran and Guatemala come to mind. You're just one person. You keep this up, well say hi to Jimmy Hoffa or Karen Silkwood for me.
This shows how much middle and upper middle income families care about working class people.  Not.  This kind of crap wouldn't fly so far if they were unionized, like so much of this industry was at one time not so long ago -- after The Jungle was written.

And the way the employees are treated contributes to the mistreatment of animals as well. It's known that many workers lash out their frustration on more vulnerable beings. It's a systematic problem.

I live about 35 miles from the JBS swift plant in Greeley CO, that John was talking about here, and in the past 25 years I’ve met hundreds of people that worked there for one amount of time or another and I’ve never heard someone tell me a good story to come out of that place, everyone has a story and they’re all disgusting, awful, or terrifying. I think that is just that industry, it’s a awful industry, where we do horrible things to delicious animals. I personally choose not to pay attention to what we do to animals at these plants and as for the human element... I honestly care more about the animals than I do the humans, people can always quit.
Arise ye victims of oppression....
What upsets me even more is that most people who choose to be vegetarian or vegan don't do it for the workers, but for the animals. Even people who say they care about the meatpacking industry aren't valuing the workers.

JBS Just Bull Shit
I worked two summers in a chicken processing plant in the 90s, and I still have pretty serious issues from the RMI I got. I saw a lot of minor and moderate injuries, nearly daily, and a couple of significant injuries. Generally, they were the result of a worker being irresponsible and cutting corners or clowning around, but some were clearly due to sheer fatigue or the sometimes unreasonable speed demanded by the floor supervisors.
This is what happens when companies get away with being considered a 'person' under the law. They get reasonable fines for an individual, but not a mass producing capitalistic behemoth.  They should start being charged x2 the hospital fees for the workers harmed in their plant. That'll easily reach in a satisfactory amount.

That’s why I’m vegan.

Meat is murder.... even for the people who make it I guess
Kind of curious how many people have been in one of these plants.
are you seriously surprised a bunch of old white dudes in the south don't want to pay and look after their workers?
more then ever, glad to be vegetarian
Well if I wasn’t already radicalised before watching this I would be now. Corporations are the plague of this world
When do we stop having managers?!
When companies claim family status, you know they just wanna fuck you over.
I work for a meat processing business. I get paid great and our company has taken very good care of all of us. Not Tyson, but it's a very large company. I don't know how Tyson does their thing, but our company has given us multiple pay raises, provided PPE, testing and started medical leave before the government required it. We've gotten bonuses, they pay for our medical insurance. The whole nine. So, I'm just saying it's unfair to label the entire industry this way.
This may not work for everyone but I suggest buying local. I use getfreerange.info to search and bought a chest freezer

Everything he says is true and it’s not nearly as bad as it really. The meat processing companies have the plant workers backs against the walls as well as the farmers contracted to them. It’s hard to imagine worst working conditions except for a war zone a concentration camp or a Haitian prison.
The amount of respect I have lost for your work after finding out you’re associated with the next for autism event is astronomical. If you can’t do the one google search it takes to listen to autistic voices on this matter, then I dont trust you to properly research your stories. Nothing about us, without us!
Fun fact!:  In 2008 or 9, I had cooked a grocery store brand chicken patty and put it on a hamburger bun with ketchup and was eating it for lunch.  I bit down on something that was in the chicken patty that wasn't meat.  I pulled it out of my mouth and looked at it.  It very much in appearance and feel resembled a acrylic fingernail.  I immediately lost my appetite and threw away the rest of my sandwich.  A week later I threw the rest of bag of chicken patties into the woods behind the house, having not eaten another one and coming to the conclusion that I never would.  I've never bought another bag of chicken patties of that brand.   After this video, I'm more convinced  that I've probably eaten part of someone's finger. We stopped buying anything from Tyson after the story about the managers placing bets.
You forgot Betty White on that list.

Worst part is that on top of all this they have to cut dead birds into pieces hundreds, if not thousands of times per day
it's insane how we have gotten to the point in history where we care more about how the animals in the meat industry than the actual people who work in it... *facepalm*
this reeks of the Koch Bros
As a factory worker I can confirm yeah shits fucked up man, I got second degree burns all over my left hand when I was 22 and they tried to stop me from going to the hospital, kept demanding I admit it was my own fault and that I wouldn’t be able to get workmans comp for it, and then made me go to a doctor hand picked by the factory who they could then had a company liaison sit in on all my appointments taking away any doctor patient confidentiality because they were looking to fire me and hoping I’d fail a drug test or get something else to document on me
Now I am not a expert on food processing logistics and pricing. But for a 1.5$  5$ a hog 20$ a cow all these employees could be provided with fair and equitable healthcare/ insurance policy. A increase in pay and better working conditions with a little to spare.
In 1906 Upton Sinclair release his book 'The Jungle' which is eerily like this video despite the 114 year gap!
What solutions are there for changing how companies and corporations are fined for worker deaths? I'm sure we start getting into utilitarian territory when we start to think about what the value of a life is, so things can get gray and arbitrary.   I have seen in the comments how Finland fines parking violators on a percentage basis as opposed to one of lump sums. Germany implements a ramp-up policy where the fine increases as the number of days an employee can't work increases; the slope here is variable depending on the situation (or something similar to this policy).  From looking at it first hand, percentages seem to be the way to go. The more money you make, an hence the more power you accumulate, the harder the fall, more responsibilities there are, and more money you have to cough up. The problem here arises when you look at monopolistic industries where 1 company dominates the landscape, as well as the specific type of industry. What comes to mind are electric utilities. Depending on the scale of the catastrophe, the utility might be fined so hard that in order to stay afloat, they need to lay workers off, cut back which regions/communities have electricity at all, and/or overcharge their customers to make up for the fine.  A better system might not be a blanket percentage fine on a company's earning, but possibly something where the percentage is variable between lowest and highest level employees. Think if a company is fined, the majority of the money to pay that fine comes from the CEO, then the next highest comes from CTOs/CFOs/COOs/etc., then business managers, department managers, project leaders, expert employees, intermediate employees, and novice employees. You'd have to figure out how to factor in merit at this point too, since the younger/less experienced worker tends to make the most failures. This solution definitely isn't perfect if I start thinking about merit.   Food for though! Take care guys ✌️
Meanwhile the average American citizen minding their own can pay $1500 for a forgotten speeding ticket-- just under half what s corporation racking billions got fined.... I hate this nation and look forward to witnessing the test of its pathetic spital from another country lol.
As a ex meat packer, End of the day the customer wants cheaper meat so we had to work harder and faster luckily I was part of a union
I'm pretty sure the fast food chain I worked at had more OSHA inspections than these meat packing companies
John is a truly compassionate human being.
this is a story about the other animals in the meat farms, the workers :)
a "blank $10,000" check? Huh? That makes no sense, unless he's saying he accepted it and wrote in $10,000? I am confused.
I wouldn't think I would ever cry for a John Oliver video. This was hard. I'm really sorry for all those people and myself as I'm working in a similar job. I worked during the whole pandemic and still working. I felt ill a couple of times but my covid-19 test request was rejected as my "symptoms were mild". Annual pay rise skipped twice "because of the hard times for the business during the pandemic" meanwhile the business received a huge amount of business support from the government, all the head office colleagues worked from home, 70% of head office and shop managers on furlough since April 2020 and getting their 80% of salaries for zero work, some of them are working for the second job and doubled their income. Pandemic hit some of us in the working class really hard, some of us already dead, rest of us become poorer than ever before.
Are you saying we are eating covid 19 infected chicken? Holy shltch covid-19 spread from human to chicken to us?
Australia has similar issues with sheep and pig factories, probably others that I’m not aware of. It’s not good.

I've been a halfatarian for a while now, meaningly I deliberately try to make at least half my meals vegetarian. Seeing the human rights situation of these workers is a strong point in favour of further reducing meat consumption.
When a company says "We treat our workers as family" what they mean is "We think you should prioritize us above everything else in your life in exchange for the bare minimum and we don't believe you deserve boundaries"

For reference, a cursory search puts the number of meatpacking employees at 500,000, which means that 57,543 Covid cases figure accounts for about 11.5% of the total workforce.
Here's the thing, if the workers join a Union, and I strongly recommend the IWW, aka the wobblies, they can collectively bargain for their rights purely by unified lightning strikes if their demands aren't met.. So, for a start, why aren't they wearing chainmail gloves on their holding hand? It's standard H&S practice for all butchers in the UK, unless they're at a much higher grade.. Facemasks on the production line, more spacing, etc, etc.. All far quicker solved by a Union explaining the benefits of happier, safer and therefore more productive staff..

That 0.0003% claim doesn't seem to be true and seems to be based either on confusing income with profit or they forgot to multiply by 100 to get the percentage. JBS's profit in 2020 was about 4.6 billion Brazillial real, which is about $830 million. $15000 is 0.002% of $826 million. Still utter peanuts, but about a hundred times more peanuts than the program claims.

In Australia OHS issues are raised at a monthly meeting with management representatives and are minuted. Ohs representatives conduct hazard identification and risk assessments. If an OHS representative deems a machine or work practice unsafe they have the power to issue the company with a PIN notice (provisional improvement notice) which gives the company 2 weeks to rectify the problem or that machine or work practice is shut down.  If an OHS  rep deems a work practice or machine poses an immediate risk they can shut it down immediately. In both of those instances the OHS representative is required to inform the governing body (WorkSafe) immediately.  As for the practice of preventing employees using the toilet, an employer would have WorkSafe all over them if they even tried that. America needs to toughen up their Labor laws.
Put a box on your head??? How could you seriously ask someone that.

Texans love their guns and their oil!
Yay capitalism

I live in a small town in Texas where one of the Tyson plants are. It’s one of the biggest employers in our area and everything Oliver is talking about is true. They treat their people like shit, but people can’t quit because they need the job.   My brother currently works at one of these plants. He works 14 hour work days slicing up animal guts and barely gets a lunch break.
Industries that historically treat their workers like crap don't magically change because there is a pandemic. Proper laws on workers rights is needed.

OMG, my company pays us even when a close relative of ours (unrelated to the company) dies, in ANY way, not to mention when something happens to one of us. We are not just treated as actual human beings, but almost as family members. They don't actually call us family, they act like we were. I can't believe this crappy, inhumane company. Is it run by psychopaths or something?
family more like $$$ and shareholders
During the lockdown I finally made the move to plant-based eating. I've lost 40 lbs, I'm feeling better than I have for decades - and I no longer have to feel guilty about all the horrific stuff that's happening to the animals and the workers in the meat industry.
It seems like after all these years Upton Sinclair did miss both the heart and the stomach
Animal rights activists and Vegans know this! We have known this for many years.   Welcome to being aware of how horrid that industry is.
115 years later, "The Jungle" is still a novel that exemplifies the American meat industry. Like, nothing's changed.
Damn. Those of us who can afford it, should stop buying that shit
Unions would be great.
We need to stop commodifying sentient beings wether they are humans or other animals.  The only way you can avoid this is by not consuming animals and switch over to the plant based diet.  If you want to learn more about the fucked up shit within slaughterhouses read “slaughterhouse” and “every 12 seconds”
People are treated like shit, and then we act all excited when they literally take one under the factory line

Fired one guy for holding onto the mini diggers bucket while the driver lifted him up and span him around. 🤦Fired another guy for taking a piss in a open excavation where they where working on clean water pipes.  The amount of times people in my country say shit like "Health and safety is out of control now days" and fucking moan about not being able to endanger them selves is actually sad. We should count ourselves lucky we have that protection.

Frankly I don't think anything short of some major restructuring or bare minimum some massive unionization efforts is gonna change this. About all we can do I guess is boycott industrialized animal agriculture and go vegan / plant based at least until there's finally proper regulations and oversight in place.   I used to love the shit out of a good juicy rare steak, and I always thought vegans were just obnoxious jerks getting between me and a good healthy meal. But between seeing how much of a strawman the rabidly anti-vegan arguments were becoming and starting to really listen to what was really going on... I hate to say it but the goddamn vegans were right and I was the real wrong bacon meme enjoying cringe lord all along  Edit: dropped some suggestions for those on the fence or uncertain about this in my comments

Surprise, surprise, going vegan doesn't only "help the animals"...
another reason why i went vegan, it's not just animals that suffer and die in the meat industry, it's also the workers packaging it. it frustrates me that the money these companies make just gets hoarded and never actually goes to the people who do the damn work so the company can get their money.
People who think it is okay to keep animals in unsanitary torturous conditions unsurprisingly don't care so much about workers.   Similarly oil companies that don't care about the environment even when it threatens human lives also don't care about the lives of the communities their drilling destroys.  Here on the internet there is an endless amount of people shitting on vegans and acting like vegans are hypocrites... The reality is that people who have taken strong moral stances to do good are often doing good in many areas. On the flip side people who turn a blind eye to one injustice often are doing it regularly. And well people causing harm in one area are really doing it all over the place.  Some of the worst treat dairy cows are reserved for the chocolate industry (eg Nestlé). The same chocolate companies are using literal child slave labour in Ivory Coast to produce cocoa. The same companies lobby and pressure governments to prevent any decent policy from workers rights to food standards. But somehow the many people on the internet think that the real problem is that some vegans are stupid... Which is true of any group. Some doctors are stupid but I'm not about to stop caring about healthcare.   Animal rights are a real issue and it not only impacts animals but all of the people working in those industries and the consumers who eat it. Poor animal rights is part of the same issue that connects all of these injustices.   It's not about valuing animals above humanity. It is about recognising the horror of reality and seeing that it is worth fixing for everyone's sake.
Maaaan, every time I watch this show, I thank fuck that I don't have to live in the usa!!! Don't get me wrong, I've got all sorts of complaints about everyday life in Australia, but in all honesty, we live in a utopian paradise here, compared to the nightmare that is the usa. The usa sounds worse than a 3rd world nation!! I mean, at least if you're living in a 3rd world nation, the reason you're living a shitty life in abject poverty is because you're living in a 3rd world nation. But the usa??? There, you have all the shitty parts of life in a 3rd world nation, but you're actually living in the richest nation in the world, so every day, the nation is rubbing your face in it, taunting you with wealth that you'll never have, but will see others enjoying, almost every day!!
The meat industry is disgusting. Of course they treat their workers like shit.

I remember reading about these issues in the book Fast-food Nation over 15 years ago. If anything, it sounds like it's got worse. 😞
Have the management of these places really thought this through to the possible end-point? Hiring a load of ex-cons and immigrants, treating them like shit on a daily basis, but then providing every employee with at least one large and very sharp knife and training them to dismember bodies with ruthless speed and efficiency? Just saying that if any of those workplaces gets a bit militant at any point or someone "goes postal", management had better be be able to run really fast if they want to escape that situation with the same number of limbs they started with that day.
I make $62.3k after taxes and student loans are deducted. If every time I put 6 people in grave danger at work and I was fined 0.00003%, I would be fined 1.8cents each time.... I’d be putting some mouse traps in the cookie drawer sitting back to watch the fun🍿   These fines are FUCKED.

I've got 5 more factories to inspect today, so I thank you for making my job very expedient."

I don’t buy meat or chicken from those 8 companies, I get them from independent halal/kosher spots. At least you know it’s a lot safer and cleaner for both humans and animals.
Question for companies; if you worked with computers would you run them constantly, never buy supporting programs and occasionally unplug the computers while expecting the computer to still be on? No? Then don’t treat your humans like that.

This is what happens when you live in a corporate oligarchy that bans workers unions to the point that they aren't allowed to go on strike unless company they want to strike against allows them to strike which defeats the purpose of a union and if workers go on strike, they are likely to be arrested and fined way more than companies get fined for quote "obstructing industrial action" (i.e banning a union for being a union ). Its a joke !

6:37 wow that guy is unlucky
A great one. Still, when at the end he emphatically asks "What can we do about it?", no answer is given. Because, the answer is: "nothing". Ruthlessness is stronger than kindness. Greed beats generosity with ease and delight. Capitalism is unstoppable. It can only self-destruct, but it's going to take a while.
So did that really happen? About the covid wagers? Can you substantiate it? Worked in meat packing plants for many years. Absolutely can confirm colleagues urinating while on the job, mostly on the kill floor. Unions go a long way to solving these issues. Oh my god! So glad to be Canadian, shit certainly happens here, but not at this level!!! Work safe is a very entrenched fundamental, all injuries are reported. Generally through in house reporting, but one can always go to direct reporting. Even the big ones like Walmart, can not defeat this. Put a box over your head while doing an inspection!!!! Hahaha!!! Inspectors in Canada can shut you down with a snap of a finger!! Done, final!!!! When covid hit some major meat plants in Alberta, they were closed, now!!! Family, a pretty fucking difunctional one!!!!!!!
Flashbacks to the Killer Bunny in Monty Python
This is a monsterous problem that needs to be fixed ASAP the workers should be protected and OSHA should be more heavily staffed.
Sounds like time to cut back on meat consumption, at least anything that isn't local, independent and has a good record. But most of us see fast food, or cheap food, and run at it.

I love watching John Oliver, everytime i watch a video, it's like watching the birth or Cyberpunk, or Shadow Run, where the Corporations have taken over the world, and its the dystopian future or hell that people see and watch from movies like Blade Runner.  he should do an episode on how the USA is basically becoming these futures.

I fucking hate companies in America. During my 15 years in the workforce (as an adult) it seems that you are much more likely to encounter a company that is trying to USE you instead of EMPLOY you.     They simply hire a temp agency to work people for about 5 months with no intention of hiring them or providing benefits. When the 5 months is up, they come up with some BS excuse not to hire you and extend the temp period. They continue this until you get frustrated and quit.  Constant supply of workers for the smallest cost to the company's bottom line.     It is sad that I see most of my friends going through our early 30's and most of us don't own a house or have kids. A lot of us are struggling with substance abuse. But hey, its the American dream for a millennial.

If this is how bad it is after the animal dies, think how badly the production line works with live animals.
The fact that the guy who kills millions of chickens through his company has a pet chicken? 😬
Yeah the other crappy thing about taking advantage of immigrants is that a lot of people come from countries without many worker safety laws, and come here and don’t know that what the employer is doing to them is illegal because they have really low expectations. Big companies know this and take advantage.
Yeah since I worked at Amazon this doesn’t surprise me. I had to tell my two male supervisors I was on my period because they came to question me about my long bathroom break.
As a brazilian, I can say that JBS is the same company, here in Brazil and in USA. Here they had the same behavior towards their employees, and of course we can't forget about the scandals envolving corruption, briebery,  selling expired meet and injecting more water in the chicken than is permited. So, they actually a bunch of pieces of shit.

If you think this is highly alarming, remember that many Americans are so brainwashed they are actually defending this despicable behaviour.

Had to pause the video because that commercial at the beginning had me in years laughing 🤣🤣🤣
I've been hinting at becoming a OHSA Inspector with my military background. Was going to build a consulting business to help companies achieve great success for lacking in x, y, z areas for improvement... but now I'm for sure this is my passion. There can be more regulation when it's the right people to bring about those issues.  Case in point... Coke and Pepsi Cola pays the $10 million fine in advance every year before being inspected, because they know the sugar grams on the cans are false advertisement and are above regulation. That's nothing to the profits they make each quarter
The meat packing plants are equally sh!t here in Canada. There has been many outbreaks, one had 300+ cases (I believe) before it was shutdown...
Hey John, could you do a whole episode on OSHA? Are they even real? Do they have any power?
Meatpacking!? Is he talking about his Saturday nights, ohhhhh🤣
Just now realizing I've never seen John Oliver and that perverted owl in the same place at the same time....
one thing I've realized is that when a corporate representative talks as if you're his family, it's not good. They use that as an excuse to treat you like family: Get free labor from you, and for you not to complain about getting abused.

Tyson's "family style working place" is solely referring to the office managerial personnel, with the rest of the meat-cutting workers the elfs that serve the family, like in Harry Porter.
Vegans have been saying this for years. Animals aren’t the only ones harmed by animal agriculture. But eating disgusting heavily processed chicken nuggets from Tyson is way more important than the welfare of other people and animals.
What can we do here? Go vegan, stop eating meat.
This is America behind the scenes

Using your quotes "... at least 1,500 ... workers at the Waterloo plant have been infected with the virus ..." then "... and eight have died ..." That is some pretty heavy redaction of the quotes, so who knows what was actually said. Leaving that aside, 8 workers died of what? Was it from COVID-19? And if it was, 8 out of 1,500 is 0.5%. It's not good that people died, but that's below the normal mortality rate of COVID-19, which is between 1.5% and 2.0%. It is unfortunate, but hardly a crisis above and beyond COVID-19 itself.

Workers are like family; you exploit them for free labour.
Isn't that why unions were created? (I understand the huge hurdle this is) The gov't doesn't want to fix this, consumers don't want to change, the company obviously has no incentive to fix this. Sadly this will all be forgotten in a few days/hours. Not many options left. robotics?

my aunt worked at perdue farms for 25 years the only reason she doesnt know is bc she got covid last year and they finally let her retire.  for years she came home complaining about everything. like she would often say the machines broke down again or 3rd shift left us alot of work.  there was not set time for the end of work she'd come home between 5:30 and 7:00 she got arthritis working there having to lift heavy boxes. she was stressed out and always in pain.   i could go and and on but the point is perdue farms is shit and im not surprised to learn tyson is too  also yeah alot of immigrants work there my aunt told me people are there from russia, africa, mexico etc.

You do have to realize that it is a virus and you cannot blame a company for you getting infected by a sick person. Should you sue that person's family because he came in sick and infected others? A company just has to say basic practices. If you are sick do not come to work. wear a mask, etc. If you still get sick it is not the fault of the company. Also how do you confirm where a person actually caught a virus? Slippery slope of accountability.

You go to the bathroom and when you return there's a manager standing at your desk wondering where you've been.

I thought it was a commercial for milk. Damn that milk made this guinea pig strong. I'm going to buy a gallon right this minute.
all i can say is how about giving them a 15 billion dollar fine. in one year with the statistics provided would lead to a grand total of 2.7 trillion dollars. sounds fair to me. after all we give people the death penalty if you go and shoot someone on the street corner but these companies are murdering hundreds of workers each year and all they have to do is pay a small fine.

Less want of a product = less people getting hurt. Eating meat means we exploit the compassion and empathy of the workers. I've talked to slaughterhouse employees covered in blood hating every moment of their job. It's a sad existence and could be stopped if we all made more conscious decisions to stop eating meat products.

Let’s talk about human traffickers contracted to staff corporate AG with essentially slaves who have to “work off their debt” under conditions not legal to keep animals in this country, particularly targeting “unaccompanied minors” who under the Obama and now likely Biden Administrations would be released to people without any identification or background checks due to “crisis numbers”. I wonder how much the companies contribute to politics and to what party. Or we could talk about the companies vital to our food supply now owned by the Chinese and the implications, did you know we once had more than 300 meat processing companies? But after destroying more humane family farms the monopolies were sold off to foreign interests at times hostile to our own. Or we could talk about the terrible conditions the animals live in since the destruction of American family farms Or about The world economic forum’s “Reset  the table” initiative & Bill Gates plan to END animal AG entirely while becoming the largest single owner of US farmland, planning to have everyone eat his Monsanto, gmo, I can’t believe it’s not meat BS whether they want it or not, cause that’s always been Bill’s business model, not the best product but you don’t get a choice so? But you’ll never hear any of that from a mainstream media corporate comedian on a propaganda network.

Fun fact (not so fun but) : 0,00003 % of your profits in a year would mean that, if you earned 30 000 $, you would have to pay a fine of just about 90 cents...

"surely this is not in our country...", if this happens and I had to guess where, america would be one of the first picks
Wow... I swear, anyone genuinely concerned that government regulations on business (especially very large industries dominated by national and multi-national [the latter EVEN MORE especially] companies) have gone too far REALLY should take a closer look at the world around them and learn more about how the economies in that world operate.
Just goes to show how communist America really is. Forced labour basically.
Literally all corporate vs factory comparison is the same. Skilled positions are competitive to fill, and those individuals could potentially take their qualifications to go into or start a competitive business. Meanwhile unskilled labor work forces are immediately replaceable and don't have the means to compete against the business.
Unskilled labor = human machine. What do you expect if you are not providing skilled labor. I've worked in two production facilities, both unionized, all that meant was slightly higher pay in exchange for signing my legal rights away to a union. The work was no different, if anything they had to try finding ways to recoup the higher pay they were forced to pay.
I literally fell to the floor to finally hear someone in the mainstream acknowledge the animal agriculture here and in the "the next pandemic" video THANK YOU OMG I'm dedicating my whole career to this and no one talks about it. we HAVE to change how we interact with animals.
Ya know, its totally crazy that people who profit from dismembering animals they claim to love and care for, take full advantage of the humans they claim to love n care for. Who would have seen this coming? Boycott of all animal products, anyone? please?
none of those middle age white people doing exercises have ever worked a production line.
People elect government officials to represent their interests. Once they are elected, government officials support Big Food; Big Pharma; Big Corporations at the expense of the very citizens that elected them. It's the American way and it's never going to change!
ya know... when the robots take all these jobs and the country put no realistic baseline pay......not gonna be pretty, BUT People arent machines, they should not have to work that fast..... If so no humans should be doing it.  this shit needs to be fixed....it's so sad and yet people still want to come here and work because it's actually still better here ewww!!!
This is why unions need to exist, especially with these limp-dick measures from the government.
Another topic could be the chicken industry as a whole. Morgan Spurlock covered it - but it deserves to be talked about !

Just missed a bit more on how JBS became such a huge meat-packing company... Buying competitors with Brazil's taxpayers money funneled to them through state owned banks, apparently in exchange for hefty campaign contributions to President Lula, later thrown in jail for doing the same thing with construction companies - which, BTW, J Oliver reported brilliantly sometime around 2016. The dirt goes much deeper...
Didn't even touch on the PTSD many workers get from killing the animals on the kill lines. That would be too traumatic to even show clips of here. But a daily lived reality for these workers.
I wonder if it's as bad in Canada?

In Canada it is not much different. I'm having to work in weather that is -35 and install cameras in 3 feet of snow and icy conditions. My ladder is being supported by a block of ice I found. Companies really do pressure you to work, you can always say no but there are 10 other people that will do your job and replace you. Even when light gets shed on their practices all they do is go into damage control mode. These companies know what they are doing and they know their bottom line is suffering. Also I'm tired of companies pretending they care about you or I should believe in their bullshit corporate culture. All they care is about making money at your expense. Then these businesses still get tax breaks and bailouts. But what is there for the workers?
"...Xmas presents aren't typically used as bribes."   WHaT?  "If you don't behave, Santa won't bring you presents.." is both a threat and a bribe. Xmas is the behavioural tool favourite of parents world-wide.  cheers.

Call your representatives and senators to demand a functional OSHA. That would be thousands more jobs right off the bat.

I worked in a Meat Packing Plant just long enough to clear rent. One of the absolutely worst places I have ever worked. Pretty much slavery. Cold, disgusting slavery
Guys this is just the jungle all over again. Wtf. I’m so glad i’m a vegetarian omg
It would be cool if the show did a segment on worker cooperatives, which is basically a better way of running a company so that the workers are treated fairly, like they share profits and they can vote for their manager.  Also, it is definitely a Last Week Tonight-worthy topic because it is not mentioned much in the media.
As much as I enjoy Last Week Tonight/John Oliver (and I can't understate this),  this segment falls short of mentioning more suffering, the killing part of the slaughterhouses. The terrified animals being forced forward toward a clumsy, painful death, and the human animals who suffer PTSD at delivering this death (by however many blows/cuts it takes). This segment also fails to mention that all this human/non-human animal suffering is unnecessary, which makes it all the more cruel and tragic. No one *needs* to eat animals. If anything, eating animals leads to the leading causes of death for humans: heart disease, diabetes, cancer, etc. Humans are healthier consuming a whole food plant-based diet.
Poultry workers in Diapers?????? this is outrageous this is slavery this cannot be they treat their employees literally like slaves they do not care about their health their mental health I would immediately stop buying Tyson brand products that company shame. It's disgusting how these workers work that disgusting companies are disgusting exploiters

Good day."_  We leave the bank and I ask: "And now?"  _"Eh.. the JPMorgan branch around the corner, and then we call it a day"_
Just a suggestion here. Don't eat meat.
Sometimes I forget that the US is a complete dumpster fire. Then I watch another one of these videos. Land of the free my ass. I’m very thankful I live in Canada.
And yall don't properly clean the meats before cooking.
Reminds me of how Upton Sinclair’s “The Jungle” was about workers mistreatment and corruption in meat packing, but consumer takeaway was that the conditions were gross: it caused a push for food health standards more than it did a push for better labour conditions.
Boycotting such companies is the only way to go.
That man worked for 3 decades for that company, never calling in sick once, and they call their staff "family", yet the moment the pandemic hit, the higher paid staff and office workers worked from home to avoid catching covid at work, but forced the rest of their "family" to work in overcrowded and dangerous conditions that they normally shouldnt be working in anyway, to catch the virus and potentially die. And when they did die, they offered nothing, and even tried to say "not our fault". Its sickening
I’m packing in meat
Back in December a friend of mine lost his arm working in a meat packing plant, altho we’re in Canada. The conditions are awful and I’m glad someone is talking about it.
'' Ehhh well at least we're not in socialist sweden huh! ''
As a ordinary citizen, to help this, go vegetarian or buy from local butcher shops...!!!!!!!
Ridiculous that you're cover meatpacking plant conditions and neglect to cover the extreme mental health issues that go along with murdering thousands of animals a day... all for a completely unnecessary food group. Also, cool that you show the most PG clips of processing the animals.  Cool story though... way to miss the point.
wow... I am so glad I live in Canada they would not get away with this this crap here. In Canada all worker have the right to refuse unsafe work and if you get punish for refuseing unsafe work your boss and the company are going to be in big trouble. And every one has mandated breaks 2 15min breaks paid and a 30min lunch unpaid but some company's pay you for your lunch too.
Heartbreaking segment aside, as a HUGE Napoleon nerd I loved that the headline at 18:06 was "The Battle for Waterloo" (my Four Time Great Grandfather fought in the Grande Armee and Waterloo). BUT, Waterloo Iowa was not named after the battlesite south of Brussels. It got it's name when someone came across it in a book of places and they like the sound of it.

It honestly seems like it is America itself that doesn't care about its people not just companies.
Wouldn't forcing someone to sign a waiver to sue before getting medial attention is the definition of under duress
I would consume half the usual amount of meat at double price in a moment notice. Please fix this
Rich Americans are just odd....
I worked for years at a meat plant.  It was mind boggling to say the least.   Whenever the line was inspected, it would be slowed down, sometimes by more than half the usual speed.    If you were injured during the job, they were very accommodating - unless you took any amount of time to get better.   The 'light duty' jobs offered were laughably bad, tone deaf, or just blind to the workers actual restrictions.   The nurse on site, who hadn't examined me in months, refuted the findings of physiotherapists - because she was a nurse, and they were a physiotherapist.   This is also the same place where someone died on the job, and they only found out when they went to yell at him for slacking off.  I tried my best to make changes, in the end - I'd ended up with an inner ear infection, and then laid off when the larger company that had bought them did some close-up corporate magic to be able to let go almost half the unionised work force.   I talked about this with someone who was currently still employed by the business, and everything I said rang true to them. More than a decade after I left.
Whenever a company you work for calls you family you should know you’re being fucked
Note to self never work in america....
Everytime I watch a show like this I think: I hope it's not as bad in Canada. Despite knowing deep in my heart as a Canadian, it's probably just as bad if not worst
Been a vegan for 12 years. I will never give my money to these companies. Animal abuse, human abuse, it is all fucking sick.
Never been happier that I am now a vegetarian.
Ah yes.. Bring up race more...
This isn't just an issue in the meat industry, though that industry is particularly egregious for physical injuries. Companies treating employees like disposable resources is a problem in virtually all corporations, and it leads to a poor quality of life for anyone working as basically a drone. The problem is capitalism run rampant, and the solution is obvious and won't be taken.
Yea, that is the country
My hometown made the show. I'm happy and embarrassed at the same time.
Don't support the meat industry. You don't need to eat meat. Be vegan.
Pay $1 more for your meat & have that money goes directly to the workers or eat less.     Never going to happen but just a thought experiment.
Who down voting this ? U dont like how america is such a fucked up place
They upload every sunday but i can't watch the video in my country until two weeks later?  Unsuded😡🖕
John Oliver - something about bicycles..  Fredrick Gertten, "Bikes vs. Cars" (on vimeo) and Zach Furness, One Less Car: Bicycling and the Politics of Automobility (Temple University Press, 2010): "5. Two–Wheeled Terrors and Forty–Year–Old Virgins: Mass Media and the Representation of Bicycling," pp. 108–139
"Family" the truly offensive F word. The only "family" like treatment you get from corporate managers is just like the alcoholic uncle who askes for more all the time.
That was Epic! Thank you Mr. Oliver.
For those in the world who dream of an unregulated capitalist society... This is what that dream looks like in practice. This is the true face of Capitalism.
I think the best part of this is that Jim over there has a family name that translates to Lost. So, yes, the dude appears in the first disturbing ad, and I see that his name is Jim Lost. Weirdly, it fits with the style.
Remind me why human tastebuds are so important again
Yet another reason I'm considering not eating meat anymore.
Hewlett Packard called me "family" two weeks before outsourcing all of us to India.
Why the hell did John Oliver want to be a citizen of that country? Seems like a horrible depressing shithole.
Go vegan and you would help a lot.
In all fairness to a tiny part of the piece, feeling like machine SOME of the time isn't necessarily bad.  It sort of comes with repeatitive, fast-paced work, which is inherent to factories (which aren't going away anytime soon--at least not globally).  I work in an electrical assembly plant and while it sucked at first, you do get somewhat used to it.  Saying that, small things like music and talking to your neighbours can really help.  It's also important to consider how heavily the rate is enforced and how considerate are those enforcing it.  I'd also be curious to learn how often these lines break down given that they don't look staggered, and therefore one machine malfunctioning could stop the whole line and therefore give workers a small, but unpredictable break. Of course, the rest of the piece still stands.
If you just added one more person to the production line, they could take over for person 1 while they take a 15 minute break, then when person 1 gets back, they give person 2 a 15 minute break, and so on, so there is always 1 person on 15 minute break. So to take away breaks for everybody, they're saving the cost of one employee.
If everyone didn't eat meat for a month and see if they get the message
You should do a story about the working conditions of nurses - especially nurses who work in hospitals.
At last, someone who talk about de faith of workers and not the CEO concerns about their bonus
Thank you for exposing this!
The covid infections not work related....   Yeah, sure.. I hope the lawyers bring up all the other super spreads in meat factories around the world.
That's a fantastic Perdue commercial, not gonna lie.
A lot of people like to typically argue against John Olivers' videos. Love to see someone try to do that for this one.
The shot at Roseanne ...not worth it.
Human machine? Nah... biorobot. It's our preferred term.
If they have to, these companies WILL pack up & move to Mexico! Let's just source our own local farmers. Pay _more_ for it, but encourage ethical practices such as health & safety for  employees AND the animals freedom to roam. Great business idea!  Kinda funny the filthy rich _know_ we out number them! They need us, not the other way around. Who cuts their grass, walks their dogs & cuts their hair? We do. This is why, 1%er's bought up ALL of the media companies. They _need_ us scared & fighting _with_ each other, not working together & against them! If they want to poison our planet to make billions of dollars & no pay tax on that money... they've _already_ bribed officials & politicians! Just imagine, working together for something bigger than ourselves.... our future! Against them, for positive changes, for a much better world.🤔 Taking money from the government either means you're poor or filthy rich, sad.

But how about the fudge business? Do the packing workers also get injured?
Not just in the US, Canada has the same issues. Alberta’s meat packing plant was the largest outbreak there too.
more dangerous than being a pig, i mean cop
Yeah, and it's extra-great how those poultry workers, who are doing that already decidedly horrific job, have to pay for diapers from their disappointingly low wage. Just fucking swell.   Why is it even remotely legal for an employer to *have* a bathroom policy, let alone a draconian one? In trade work, our rule is we go when we fucking need to, and the boss and go fuck a drill-press if he thinks we're not going to, and they, realizing they won't have workers otherwise, accept it. In some shops the bathroom is pretty gross, but it's there, and if there isn't, the boss can expect a well pissed on car. What I'm getting at is that the average worker in the US has less rights than a low-skill trades worker in other countries, and the US has judge's that decree that workers have an obligation (a *fucking obligation*, not the ability to choose to be an idiot) to die on their companies behalf.  Edit: Yeah, about those fixed fines? Those were designed that way because it was a given that they'd become hopelessly obsolete, and the corporations were well aware that the US political system is so fucking dysfunctional that no real updates would be forthcoming. While ~4k was once a not insignificant amount of money, even to a fairly large corporation, it is now less than nothing to one. This is also why I hate using fixed fines in the legal system, all fines need to be based on the party involveds ability to pay. If a multi-billion dollar corporation has an fuck up that was preventable and shows an astounding lack of empathy to have allowed, the actual management involved in the decision making process, as well as the company, need to face consequences, and since they won't be sent to actual prison ever (they'll at best be sent to the prison where you get to meditate all day, not actual prison). If a trillion dollar corporation has a million dollar fine, they are literally going to be laughing about it, make that fine in the billions and they *might* notice.

I've worked at a meat plant before, and it is one of the worst "shit" jobs out there. It's wet, cold and you stand in one spot all day, and the pace just makes you pissed that you are scrambling for the minimum wage you're making.
But they don’t care. As long as the profits out strip any charges and/or costs, it will continue.
The United States is a third world country inasmuch as that term exists anymore. There are very few parallels between it and any other industrialized nation.
Yikes, how does that nurse work there?
You know you're that owl John.
The box over the head of the inspector is disgusting.  "You can't look because you'd see violations".   A confession of guilt right there.
even if all the meat packing workers caught the cooties   99.999 percent of them would be fine and ready to work within a week...
bUt We NeEd To EaT aNiMaLs!
Thats what people in the USA are worth. 0.00003% of chicken farm profit. Pretty allegorical, you guys are the fucking chickens.
I worked at Tyson for years and it's not as bad as John is acting like it is. Not even close.
Yeehaw capitalism
In America a thief gets rich telling his victims they are stolen from, then everyone endlessly forgives and forgets and lets them do it again.
Boss are the worst people Ive ever come across personally all 10 or 12 of them were completely lazy lying bastards.
It’s so weird as a Canadian who worked in a unionized pork plant to see just how horrible American plants can be. All of the issues brought up were focused on and solved.  Knife injuries? You have a solid plastic wrist guard, anti cut gloves, chain mail gloves, a big chunk of leather called a belly guard, and depending on the area a plated belly guard. These were provided by the company to everyone in a position that could encounter those certain dangers.  Work load and bathroom breaks? Sure some days you were behind and you had to bust ass and wait it out for a coffee break to pee, but most of the time you could rely on a Forman’s aid to cover for you, or a union rep to jump on and cover for a minute you needed to pee.  Physical stress and injury? Oh boy we had those. I slipped on ice and broke my shoulder. Everyone had boot allowances once a year, and if you forgot them you were provided a pair of pretty good quality rubber non stick boots. They wernt the most comfortable, but they got you to your next pay check to buy your own. Our on site nurses didn’t bother giving muscle cream, they just had some giant pumps for them outside the office. If you felt you needed it, they had it. Anything above meant they would take care of you. Physical examination, and usually a trip to a doctor.  I should also point out that the vast majority of our employees were immigrants with a healthy amount of former felons, and then old sweats, and while some would gripe, nothing was ever so unfair, because if it felt that way you went to the union.  I truly don’t understand how just a short hop across the border to the richest nation on earth you have these massive issues, when your neighbour has so much of it figured out.  Unions aren’t always a good thing, but in this case, meat packing workers in the unites states NEED to unionize.
Money talks. As long as people keep buying it, this won’t change. See Nestle, or any other mega Corp.   Hey, we don’t care about the kids making our shoes, why would we be concerned with grown adults who chose to work at these places? (Sarcasm, hopefully obviously.
If *this* Video doesn't make you go vegan, I don't know what's wrong with you...
I wish John would just jump to the point and start making people aware that the root of the problem and near every other problem his show addresses is late stage capitalism
Look into Cargill, too.
Yeah no I would never want to live in the US. Disfunctional society
Greatest country in the world 🤭🤨
It is  UNITED STATES  OF CORPORATIONS and even the  presidents are chosen by them not the people
Consider going vegetarian or vegan!
So... As far as the bathroom break situation... Like Amazon but with meat instead of Echos?
America. The richest, most advanced 3rd world country.
They don't even want to give the people working during the pandemic hazard pay, that's how much they care for em.
I mean the industry is founded on the back of abusing animals it's not surprising it carries on to the workers.
10:35  BIILLLYYYYY !!
Another words, it would be more effective to fine up to fifty percent of the company’s net worth. That way it would really give companies a reason to give a fuck about their workers.

It always amazes me how people create organizations like OSHA then don’t give them any power at all. How do you expect them to solve the issues they uncover? Strongly worded emails? They need to have the power to cripple a company.

At this point Comedians, are smarter then most news casters, or hell even the Damn government.

Using the “we are a family” term on a workplace is emotional manipulation tactics. Criminals do it too. Saying we all family in this money life funding situation called work. Don’t fall for it.  Especially co-workers that like to refer to you as a relative like brother/sister son/daughter whatever. Titles like that on non-relatives should take years and or some significant  life-impacting events to build. The ppl that put those titles on you do so as a way to emotionally control you, forcing you to be loyal, so when they mess up you think twice about reporting them or you feel compelled to cover for them.  If someone you barely know well start using that family terminology, think first “did I do enough of anything to earn that from them? Did this person skip over friend and go straight to family?” Suspect!   Also, another manipulation tactic, someone you barely know start revealing their secrets. Like really, we worked for 1month and you trust me? They do this so you fall for it and open up about your life. Cops do this shit when interrogating suspects. Offering up something that is worthless to them but you perceive it as valuable and think “wow this person really trusts me and opens up to me. I should reciprocate it seems safe” NOPE! And they be the same ppl quick to accuse you of “having a wall up”. Fucking mind games. My response is, “why do you think you privy to be let over that wall?”
Damn kind of messed up seeing this. I've been working for Tyson for years. I work in shipping/distribution though. I have family that work in processing and they never mentioned anything like this. They do complain about the pace and schedule.
Wrong title. Here's the good one: "Slavery in meat factories not hold accountable"
I worked at a Jennie-O, all this is true. My shoulder is permanently effed cuz of running 32+bpm. 60+% were refugees and islanders. And in the less than 2yrs I worked there someone got fingers cut off.
This is no joke these warehouses like meat packing , cold food , etc are slimy as fuck ..they hire Hispanics and pay them barely above minimum wage for years (I know one girl making 8.00 an hour for 14 years) , they were you like a slave require 6 days a week 70 hours a week , upper management makes ass loads of money with great benifits , if you make a complaint or bring something up they let you go
They’re trying to push chlorinated chicken and unregulated unsafe GMO on the UK they want nothing to do with any of that in this story for the most part is exactly why the shit we do to the chicken and other meat is not done in other countries, Despite what you’ve been told America is a shit hole country and nobody wants low quality food from this country
People need to stop seeing corporations as a collection of people run by people people also need to stop seeing capitalism as anything other than an evil monster that needs to be satisfied by these companies the pandemic has woke a lot of people we need them more woke.
Before workers compensation in the 1920s there were industrial corporations that would do the same thing as these chicken processing plants in that they would injure workers and make them suffer and one guy wasn’t going to hear it anymore he wouldn’t get a shotgun and blew all the supervisors away
But when everything goes robotic you’re going to notice that you’re going to see more processed garbage foods everywhere because they’re going to be able to ramp up production with these robots, the lowest common denominator person that shops at Walmart is the problem with this
In 10 years you will watch this and think how did we not solve this sooner, in 10 years robotic workers will process raw meats.
This is why you go organic, as these standards aren’t applicable, organic gas more stringent safety regulation and processes.
When any employer says that “you are family” get the fuck out of there as soon as you can, because they’re going to exploit you’re like family and not pay you
Organize and unionize! That goes for workers all across the country. "The Market" will never regulate itself. When the federal and state governments cut funding for inspection agencies, they won't be able to make inspections. And when the governments make laws that prohibits inspections, and when the fines are equivalent of us paying 0.0002 cents for parking tickets, you know that the system is broken. Such working conditions, in which people get badly hurt on a daily basis, are appalling! You know how politicians and everyone keeps saying that the US is the greatest, freest and most democratic country in the world? That's simply and absolutely not true. It's the greatest for those who have money, who can buy cheap labour, without a second thought given to workers' safety and well being. You are disposable. You need to organize and unionize!
all outlined in the book fast food nation by eric schlosser almost 20 years ago. nothings changed.
Those facilities are Inhumane
Even after watching this I’m still a proud meat eater
Yet another reason to become vegan. Appalling
That Perdue commercial 🤣🤣😄
Time has not been kind to Oliver
In school rn, I'm learning about how in the 1890s we had these same exact problems. Shit hasn't changed.
You either want socialism or you are somehow using exposes like this to convince yourself you feel bad about these conditions while having no intention to do anything about them because you believe you benefit from it.
The 5,000 who didn't like this video support workers being treated worse than the meat at these plants.

Considering how inhumanely factory farmed animals are raised and slaughtered, is it surprising that factory farm owners treat their workers poorly? Factory farms have a total disregard for life in general :-/
What about Cuomo?
As an employee of a meat packing in Green Bay Wisconsin on the kill floor I witnessed many bad things which you are mentioning.  In the main issue is standards slow down the machinery for humans to Process the animals   Safety first slow down the greedy money  machine.
I really feel bad for that man's actual family if he treats them like this.
America dont sound so great to me
Sounds to me like capitalism is working at its finest
I don't care about the working conditions of illegals. They knew what they were getting into when they came here.... illegally
anyone read the jungle by upton sinclair?
"it's just a fun fact that I'm throwing in there for no reason" lol transparent clown. Your race-baiting is obvious
I love you LWT. I appreciate your show so much that I pay for it on youtube. Unfortunately I live in Canada. So I was amazed by the fact that I have access more quickly to your content using a VPN in the US where the show is up one week earlier. Could you guys please fix this? Again thank you.
Nothing about Biden?? You are a Joke!!!
I started working at one of these companies because of covid in Canada overall so far its not as bad but I haven't been working there that long so ............ idk

American capitalism is fcked up game. People working on low positions are basicly slaves. No rights, no value, no future.
The painstaking play july replace because lycra relatedly jam down a delirious clef. irritating, vulgar car
It is disgusting. And it's all a result of our reliance on employment for survival income creating a lever for employers to exploit workers. Go through the issues presented in this video and ask yourself, how much of this would be happening if people had a #UBI providing enough to meet their basic needs, unconditionally? Would these workers put up with this treatment? Or would they refuse such working conditions, because they can afford to, thus forcing the employers to do better? Regulations can only ever mitigate the problems created by poverty. Only eliminating poverty entirely solves these issues and so many more.
Is there a legit reason why the plants put out so much food? Seems like a lot of it goes to waste in supermarkets.
He did an upton sinclair's the jungle 100 years later
America slipping down the slope. Sad.
> a product that is wildly popular in this country  Watching woke people trying to sound smart?
There is no way around what we have to do: 1) Pay more for meat 2) EAT LESS MEAT  I have been vegan for 4 years. You all don't need to go vegan, but we absolutely have to decentralize this industry. This is not new information, come on..Eat less meat, shop locally at farmers markets (if possible), vote/ communicate on/ with local politicians, and have the difficult conversations. Change happens slowly
This is what happens when you have an almost completely ununionized workforce and if they have a union it's too weak to do anything.
Waiting for libertarians to wax about how free markets will set us free
11:10 bathroom looking like the weeknd halftime show
Or we could fix our broken food system altogether and move towards more plant-based, which is not only healthier, more just and better for our struggling planet but which would solve the problems explained in this video as a mere side-effect.
I've been following you for years!!!!! When would you make a video about farmer protests in India? Ignore if you already have :)
Automated machines can build cars but can't pack meat?
The show has always been preachy and extremely biased, but since the doing it in the void bit...it has been worse, to a point I can't even watch anymore. Maybe this clip talking about something that isn't Trump and republicans is a sign the show is going back to being more informative instead of just another show of people's angry opinions.
Even though this was a somber subject there was soooo many opportunities for Adam Driver jokes here...I was half expecting it.
The industry that treats lives as a product doesn't care about its workers?? Whaaat??? I'm all for John's suggestions of strongly regulating these factories, but realistically, this industry needs to lose its subsidies and fade out.
Thank you, John Oliver, for bringing the evils of meatpacking to light.  For  more information on meatpacking, including what the animals suffer leading up to it, read Prisoned Chickens, Poisoned Eggs: An Inside Look at the Modern Poultry Industry, by Karen Davis, and Slaughterhouse, by Gail A. Eisnitz.
“Meatpacking” is what John Oliver does with other men every night.
it's totally our country.
Batheooms: u go before u start work and on ur break even if u dont have to go. That's how u train ur body when it's time to go.  Hands hurt: take some tylenol. Construction works always hurt. That's what we do.
I would never work a job that didnt allow you time to go to the bathroom, its ridiculous that people allow this, I understand the need for money but honestly its not worth it, your safety and health is more important.
I'm in Iowa and I'm disgusted at Tysons for this and also I'm surprised i did not hear about this sooner and the reason i am so disgusted is not only the behavior but also since pork incredibly important to Iowa since it is the corn and pork state and this behavior in a pork packing factory is unacceptable especially in  Iowa
GOD BLESS AMERICA
16:21.. now fore real.. how the fuck can a funeral cost more than 15k USD or whatereve the fk currency you want to convert to  ?!?!?!

I dont know who unironically would watch this clown.
Gee, that guinea pig acts quite like my two toms when they're playfully fighting and chasing each other on the lawn around our house! :-)
Thank God I'm not from the States😖
When a company says we're family, RUN!
No surprise that an industry that commodifies animal life for profit cares little for the lives of its human employees. Treating them as disposable inputs. While pretending they're "family".. An abusive family.  This is why I switched to eating plants.  Preserve your humanity and conscience.
Disclaimer: I'm a vegetarian with vegan leanings. I am not against people eating meat, per se, but I am definitely against animal death camps and related processes. Clearly, it is bad for the animals, that's a no-brainer, but rather than wanting to point my finger at meat eaters, I would invite them to get their meat produce from more ethical sources. Sure, it will be more expensive, but less meat in your diet is healthier for you and better for the environment and ultimately better for the demographics that end up in the squalid jobs (faux slavery) shown here.
John Oliver is garbage.
The US = 3rd world
You can replace  the owl with John Oliver's picture and no one would even know the difference 😂
The comedy writing on this show has really gone to shit, but the content is still interesting....even if nothing will ever change.

I'm glad to see that our gov't changed so much ever since Upton Sinclair wrote about the horrors of the meat-packing industry in 1904... What...? Oh... Nevermind...
Grateful that a horrendous colonoscopy 14 years ago made me go plant-based.  I got to thinking about fast food.  What if meat cost, say $50 for 1/4 lb of whatever?  Then the very people who can’t afford to have Type ll Diabetes, heart disease, etc. would find that eating whole-food-plant-based 99% of the time would eliminate those diseases.  Three films (no judgement!!!) I’d recommend include “What the Health,” “The Game Changers,” and “Forks Over Knives.”

There has to be a Democrat in office for this guy to talk about the things that matter. Glad he is back I can finally watch this show again
That's why my hard earned money isn't going to the meat industry anymore. I want plant-based companies to thrive and create alternative no-risk jobs for those people.
Nothing will happen
Anything that has to do with meat is disgusting. Be it breeding, slaughter, packaging or whatever. All good reasons to stop eating meat.

That’s strange I do commercial roofing and any safety rule broken is 130k fine. We just had a guy fall of a roof. 40 feet. He broke both his arms and a few ribs. We got fined 150k
I've said it before and will say it again: if your place of work uses the exact same indoctrination language as a murder-suicide cult, ala "family", GET OUT. They will work you to death with no regard for anything except their own company's appearance.
I live in the county in which the JBS plant is located. The vast majority of citizens here are absolutely brainwashed by the republican lie machine and their corporate overlords. It's genuinely sad and terrifying.
Oh crap Jaime! Not you too?!??! Stop acting like you have live audience and start beiing your self. Just stop. Please.
Only the oligarchs will be able to eat real meat. The rest of us will eat processed soldier fly protein (maggots) or estrogen-saturated "Impossible Burgers" to neuter us. Welcome to the Reset.

Another day John Oliver attacks low hanging fruit video
...and some Americans are more inclined to bleat about sweatshops in China, Vietnam, Bangladesh et.al whilst their very neighbours are technically indentured. 🙄
The freer the market, the freer the people, eh...
Dear Mr.Oliver. I have a favor to ask. I understand that in order to be popular in the "great" Britain and "the colonies" you need to dilute serious conversation by adding unfunny jokes every 30 seconds (yes, go ahead, viewers, CHECK). Unfortunately, I have come to like your videos, but, fortunately, I'm neither a brit nor a yank (neither are you, they WILL hang you by the neck one day). Is there any chance you could add a special montage of your videos WITHOUT those every-30-seconds stupid jokes, for people from countries where intellect is not considered a symptom of communist satanism? Thank you.

Way to look out for your 1% Tyson/OSHA..America? Mr Oliver, thank you.
Sad that this is everywhere. Got a serious neck injury from a machine at a warehouse and was forced to sign a release to get back to work. At barely a living wage... I couldn't afford the time off so signed away my rights to keep a roof over my head. At another warehouse different company, while assembling cheap bbq grills the drill slipped (cheap alloy screw bent/broke) and went right through my hand. Scrubbed out the debris, band aids on both sides since it went straight through, took a day off to keep injury minimally clean but if I went to a doc seeking relief I would be released. For this one I took the loss and saw the doc. Both injuries have come back in bad ways but what am I to do? Keep your head down and keep working if you want a paycheck. I can't afford more medical bills that I can't pay off in this lifetime.  This is everywhere. Corporations have taken too much.
The situation is similiar here in Germany and Austria. To circumvent the work safety rules, the factory workers are sub sub contractors mostly from Eastern Europe.
So I wonder if things would change if "Americans " took these jobs.
There was a great reason why we didn't allow industry monopolies. Our politicians and their pets are factory farming animals, workers and NOW OUR ELDERS!
I don’t see anything wrong with betting on a number. The lottery does it.  Sports bets involve two numbers.  As long as they weren’t doing anything to try to manipulate the number, other than ‘downward as much as possible’, what’s the big deal?  Not giving adequate breaks? THERE’S your problem!
Cluckingham Palace. Now that’s 😄
12:54 KAREN'S Karens"s everywhere!!! Run and hide. Karen has overtaken Tyson!!! .
My Mom, at 16 year old, worked in a chicken processing factory back in the 1960's. To this day, she still hates eating chicken.
We can thank Republicans for the poor treatment of workers.
Are the 5 thousand thumbs downs just company owners getting mad at the facts slapping them in the face? Selfish greedy f*cks.
Going Keto, you eat more meat fat which is more filling, less lean meat, less processed meat, spend less money on meat so you can afford to buy organic meats from local ranchers you know and trust, and lose weight without going hungry.
No one wants to talk about how there’s only enough beef to supply 60% of what we’re eating there’s not enough beef on this planet to support the United States so 40% of your burger is a protein substance filler what is the filler do you know McDonald’s has their scientists who genetically make their meat taste good and add flavor they admit this what’s the flavor human DNA cow do you neither growing proteins Slery  but from who and from what
Even longer term solution: End the meat industry altogether. The future is plant-based.
It's stuff like this that makes me feel ashamed to be called an American. I really hope I die in another country so I don't have to make my family visit America to see me.
Sad thing is this is how it goes at any company with divided corporate and physical labor. Send the desk jockeys on 10 vacations a year while the people on the line can't take 1 sick day.
Well, still better than factories in China🤷
Simple: stop eating meat.

No context given on the number of employees at the factories. How do we know the % of employees contracting the & dying from the virus is more than the average for the state/country? It's numbers taken out of context.
These plants are also in 'right to work' states which actively discourage any union ideation.
The fuck happened to Teddy Roosevelt's laws for worker safety and such in the meat packing industry. It was bad then too. He reformed laws and created laws because body parts and such were found in meat packages etc. He did this after reading "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair..   The fuck happened?
Chinees company's own some of these?
It's sad that America's meat is owned by China and Brazil..
Friendly reminder that every single problem John listed in this video is caused by metastasized capitalism.

It does not surprise me and yet the poor earning repub thinks this is fine.  If people, who can, would quit voting for corporation control this could be stopped.

Whew, thank god I live in Finland! No offence Americans, but we have decent working conditions in comparison.
I refuse to buy Tyson anything its gross!! PERIOD.
It's a little hard for me to feel sorry for people who work in animal agriculture, but something really needs to be done about the higher-ups who treat their floor workers so disposably. Shutting slaughterhouses and meat packing plants down and forcing their owners to change industries sounds like a good place to start.
When they don’t care about the lives and well-being of animals, why would they care about the well-being of humans?
I had to work with a broken hand....I’m a security guard...
JBS's * REVENUE* was 50 Billion... revenue is not profit Their profit was roughly .2% of their revenue
I think the true problem I'm America is most people rely on other people to survive. This is why I moved to a bigger property with the main purpose to homestead. Growing and raising your own food is something 99% of people don't want to do. Give a man a fish and they eat for one day teach them how to fish and they can eat forever. Stop blaming others for issues we can solve by not purchasing corporate products.
John knows about meat packing

The meatpacking industry sounds horrible, but it's not just the meatpacking industry. It's corporate. I've had jobs where is we were busy there were no breaks. I got written up for going to the bathroom twice, while customers were waiting. I've seen people get fired because they got an injury. But I'm pretty sure the meatpackers have it worse since they are being taken advantage of if they are immigrants. But anyone that's ever worked a line knows you can't leave to piss, so it really is not surprising to me that people would were diapers, no joke, I've thought about it. People are being treated like machines in every low-level corporate job and people are treated as disposable, especially in rural places where work is hard to find.

I've read about a foot down the list of comments; so far, no mention of meatless Mondays. We live in Pottersville (It's a Wonderful Life) and a grubby bunch of "garlic eaters" the lot of us. Capitalists depend on a docile, easily-duped populace devoid of any capacity or desire to act rationally. George Bush the afterthought confirmed this serf-building sentiment in his first State of the Union address: "Get down to Disney World in Florida," he said. "Take your families and enjoy life, the way we want it to be enjoyed." Notice he specifically doesn't say the way YOU want it to be enjoyed, which reasonably might be expected to be with a lot less meat.
We need a sequel to Sinclair’s, “The Jungle.”
The border is extremely important to these companies bottom line
I am friends with related to many plant workers. Oil companies are just as bad. in no way does the plant give a fuck about anybody there, they have had covid shut downs and lockdowns, people getting covid all the fuckin time it's ridiculous.
there's a book called Slaughterhouse, 2006, that covers all this. PLEASE READ. Not new, need new laws to protect people AND ANINALS. Torture is a crime
Love that they always find some funny video to go along with their sad story
I'm sorry but I am still so confused about what a violent gerbil attack has to do with TV dinners. I legitimately do not understand the connection they're trying to make
@LastWeekTonight I need a clean version so I can show this to my students! We're learning about the industrial revolution and they need to see this! but robot fucking a soup.. can't show that.. :'(
Im just glad he finally quit talking about Trump man that was exhausting and I genuinely like the show
go vegan - we don't need this video! Fire the companies with the workers
How can people not see that capitalism is beyond disgusting now? ... it's putrid.
That's why folks change your mindset and change your goals in life. Nobody deserves to undergo these kind of work enveironment that is modern day slavery.  Fall down 7 times but stand up 8..
Makes you wonder who is better off the chickens or the employees?
just another bullshit hit piece attacking the meat industry paid for by PETA....
Processing 35+ chickens per min seems like an excellent way to spread antibiotic resistant campylobacter
How about more unions instead of more regulations. Regulations are needed and useful, but don't be surprised when the OSHA can't properly protect workers, the government will always lean towards the interests of companies. We need to empower the workers!!!
This guy probably eats meat. Go vegan to take some personal responsibility.
I work for JBS and this is honestly the way we're treated. We're told family comes first and btw we're your only family. The virus keeps cropping up in our facility and they refuse to admit that it is in our facility.

Meat packers that rump insisted keep working with no protection must get u.s. citizenship and their families. Instantly.
You know - watching this segment has me thinking;  with all this bickering we do with each other like opposing terrorist organizations  based on political/religious philosophies  & such - how IS it we've (and I mean the craziest of 'we") never gone after the owners or CEOs & their 'partners in crime' to make conditions like this a usual thing? - this is absolutely ludicrous.  Its like all the laws changed to make work conditions decent back in the 1930s never happened.
Companies need to stop calling employees family. We're tired of it
It is really disappointing that just from the beginning of the video you said that the conditions that animals face inside this facilities are terrible, but that they are already "talked enough"... Well no, I couldn't find any single video where you talk about them and how animals are not products to be sold, so let's begin there. I totally understand that workers conditions are so bad as well, but at least this people have a voice to speak up and to act on it. Animals only have their lives and humans still take it away from them. So unfair and so sad that you John Oliver won't dig in this topic because this show is probably supported by sponsors or because your comfort zone and resistance to change won't let you do the changes that are needed for the world to improve in so many aspects, but you probably already know, I wouldn't believe that someone as smart and well prepared like you didn't know about it.
As disgusting as all of this is, read about the meat packing industry in the 1900s.  The book is called "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair. This book inspired, then President Theodore Roosevelt, to establish the USFDA.
ngl I love this show, but i’ve tried to watch this episode 3 times and fallen asleep twice lmao
When he shuts up about Trump. He's pretty good.
What's more disgusting is the sell-out politicians with easy lives that let this happen.
upton sinclair literally wrote the book on this over 100 years ago and it's still this bad
The average rise functionally choke because jail clinically serve throughout a gigantic baseball. nippy, ceaseless hubcap
I remember the book published in 2001, Fast Food Nation: the Dark Side of the All-American Meal. It addressed similar issues & food quality in America. Sadly, not much has changed.
This would work all well and good if companies hadn't since the time of Reagan being withering down on employees rights by buying legislation, congressman,  senators, and presidents.
OSHA where you at?
I knew I'd have to brace myself for this one. The blatant disregard for human rights and the extreme injustice and inequality makes my blood boil. We need to get money the hell out of politics NOW to have any hope of decent transparency and accountability.
This is why I kill Butcher and harvest my own meat
This reminded my of "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair
So Mr. Oliver if I were a millionaire  I would not mind paying $8 a pound for chicken.  The person who complains without proposing a solution is just bitching. Please offer a solution instead of complaining. Let's do a thought experiment. Let's say there are 10 workers per line, basically 5 per side of the production line. Because of social distancing there are only two workers per line instead. Is the price of chicken going to go down,  remain the same, or go up. Of course the price will increase due to the reduced amount of chickens being produced for consumption.  Let's also include the maintenance workers who are present every day and night working who also have to socially distance while working together. Sounds like a contradiction? It is. John wants to complain about the working conditions for people and yet does nothing...... besides complain for a profit. 📈

Hey. HEY. Don’t kink shame. If a man enjoys paintings of fowl play, there’s nothing wrong with that. If your painting of rats fucking is okay, then so is this. I’m disappointed in you, John.
try not to think about the local camera crew that's filming a piece about your corporate office culture that will one day be uncomfortably juxtaposed with how appaulingly your company treats their workers in it's factories in a live show.  -  saving it for future me

Welcome back to Last Week Tonight where a British guy yet again, tries to save America from itself.
So the US is officially back in the 1900 era of worker rights movements. Fantastic.
When you make a rule that says all work injuries need to be reported, you get complaints of government overreach because sometimes of course the injury IS just treatable with a band-aid. But if you don't do that, companies will just exploit the loophole and treat everything with a band-aid to avoid reporting. Absolutely disgusting.
Proud to be a vegan, but not as Proud as not being an American xD

No body care for those workers and that will not change and no matter how much noise there is no body cares.

upton sinclair 2: Electric boogaloo
People can be horrified all they want, this isn't going to really END until Americans stop feeling like we need cheap meat fourteen meals a week. Regulation might tinker and improve things a little, but the whole system is driven by our collective appetite for cheap meat.  It is possible to find meat that was pastured on small independent farms and processed at small local meat locker facilities. But guess what? It's more expensive.  So including meatless meals in our diets is also part of the solution.  If you're interested in switching to non-factory meat, the Eat Wild website has info on farmers. Farmers markets are another good way to make connections.

A lot of this is misinformation. when the illegals were rounded up at the meatpacking places the citizens filled their place. .

Oh paleez, wake up.  Government is inept, and the whole cozy corporate-and-wealthy-funded-government doesn't nor shouldn't give a crap about us - we are now irrelevant - except on election day, where we are increasingly irrelevant, but - for now - necessary.  Worker programs are increasingly just shells to claim that they have "systems" in place to "solve" all of the problems the proletariat might bitch about, just they don't really work to solve any of the problems, so just shut up, and stop yur yammin'!  Pharaohs and slaves has been the model forever, and this is just the latest iteration, til they tee up the next one.  Shangri-La!  Put a fork in it, Ethel, this goose is cooked.

Well if America was run by an actual progressive social democracy then none of this would be happening. We would've have beaten covid-19 years ago if Bernie Sanders was president but no corporate Democrats and republicans dictate what we should have. Also Biden bombed Syria for more oil yay.

I never eat meat ever again because of this video.Love this show.
That is the second episode in a row, where John should have said:  "So, what can we do against this? Because there is absolutely no way this is the best version of this situation mankind could do. And because the victims are sentient, feeling creatures, there has to be done something in any way. But instead of hoping that politics and lobbies for the food industrie would change anything, you can sign a bill on everyday you go shopping and eat less meat. Yeah. I know what you think: Common John, go f*** yourself with the vegetearian/vegan bullshit. But listen, because whether you like it or not. This is one if not the most effective way, if you wanna change something about that on your own. Eat and buy less meat and other animal products.  And now....this!"

Current debate in my country is whether we should attend the world championship soccer in Quatar in 2022, given the poor and even deadly working conditions of the (foreign) construction workers of the stadiums where the event should take place. Well, if that is a point of contend, maybe we should check our relations with the US too, given the poor and even deadly working conditions in it's meat packing industry.......
Those are office workers not factory workers.
Denying an employee a bathroom break is an OSHA violation. Someone needs to protect these employees. This is why so we need unions. There are whistleblower protections but humans are vicious. I am sure they are still threaten.
And people think indentured servitude ended in the USA lol. CEO’s are slave masters and slave masters are CEO’s.
Remember when Mitch McConnell was withholding corona virus relief funds when families were suffering, in favor of protecting large corporations that run businesses like this, Ian’s through policy insuring they hold no liability when a worker get sick or dies? When are we going to end the corporate bribes, I mean “campaign contributions” that enable greedy pigs to look out for their own interests over every one else’s?
#deportJohnOliver
By implementing changes that benefit workers companies will shoot the prices to the consumer through the roof, making the cost of living outrageously higher for everyone because obviously, the rich will NEVER, EVER give up their precious profits.  They will fight back with sacrificing EVERYONE ELSE as long as their profits remain intact.  I say all those improvements to OSHA and the USDA be financed DIRECTLY by profits being made by these companies, not by the employees' unions, not by taxpayers' money, not by price spikes but directly by companies' profits and to not allow them to spike their prices nor to punish their employees for fighting for their rights to a safe workplace and don't forget, their minimum wage should be increased at the same rate as inflation and that increase should come from the company's profits; they can afford it, they make fifty billion dollars a year, I'm sure that's enough money for all this and they will have billions left to spare every year.
I am against FORCING people to work in such conditions. Can't they just say "oh fvck this" and walk away ?
This isn’t just meat plants. It’s most factories. TLDR. Wash any canned food because there’s for sure piss on it
They deserve to suffer and be punished for their contribution to the animal abuse and suffering.

This sounds exactly like the Tönnies meatpacking facility outbreak in Germany.  Migrant workers who lived in company-provided housing on the premises got sick by the hundreds.  It was thus the company's fault that they could not socially distance at work OR in private because those "accomodations" look like converted shipping containers with a bunch of bunk beds in them.

Everybody should watch John Oliver.  His channel is one of the most honest and unbiased on youtube so far.
The next time you go to the grocery store to buy boneless, skinless chicken breasts for $1.99/lb remember what it takes to make chicken that cheap. At that price, it’s insane to think that anyone in that food production chain can be treated well and still provide a profit to the company.  I just wish I knew if the companies that sold their products for more were treating their workers better,.
Thank you, thank you, thank you for  telling the truth!
They fired the employees yet we are going to muster up some fake outrage anyways. What else do you want Jon Oliver?
the dude pissing under the conveyor belt... suspended! How about fired? Well, honestly he's not making anything much more worse than it already was. Destroys human health, destroys the earth, destroys animals needlessly. Animal agriculture is complete garbage. Go vegan.
It's funny that I have actually heard about all of this from the knife problem to the pissing on the line. Apparently the urinating on the line thing was not due to performance needs but just the level of care they took with the food. It was just a case they didn't care and that was the level of employee they hired.
Maybe employ furries, webcomic artists and Deviant Artists, they love being in Diapers.
I have heard so many stories of people pissing on meat production lines, especially hotdog's.
Yes, "chicken chips" sounds gross, but what's even more gross is holocausting chickens every day to make "chicken chips".
They should cut most of the jokes and have him slow down his delivery. His delivery is so breathless its just hard to listen to. The jokes are really bad, they are like Family guy, its just a formula, it doesn't feel creative at all.

so, why does it take someone on HBO to talk about this shit? cuz i dont hear anything about this topic. i know problems come from unions, but this is just an argument to unionize if i ever heard one. i believe unions should be mandatory for any factory jobs if you're just a standard worker , this is just bat shit crazy.
How did you not mention "The Jungle"?   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle
Kill capitalism before it kills us all.
Seems crazy to me to talk about human rights when these companies actually kill millions of animals every day.
I see the issue being ultimately dealt with with technology. Computer controlled carving stations replacing workers seems like what will eventually happen. If minimum wages go up and regulations get tighter, these megacompanies will invest money to automate the process as much as possible.
Democrats should be ashamed themselves for letting this happen to workers. Too much regulation means smaller companies are booted out of competing with bigger companies.
Really unusual this episode starts with John touching up on Cuomo's nursing home cover-up and procedure , meat packing, and Ted Cruz. Out of the 30 minute episode, 98% is about Ted Cruz and the meatpacking. John considers himself moral and a voice for the people. 28 minutes of covering partisan issues to his favoring where maybe 200 people died versus the Cuomo event where thousands died. Cuomo received 10 seconds of airtime. What a partisan hack that has a moral compass that needs to be reset.
this show is basically a British guy demonstrating how capitalism is a horrible and inhumane social order for 20 minutes every week

Capitalism. America. the GOP. Add them up you get DEATH.
Wow.. this show is doing God's work.
Mr. Oliver, a related and excellent article by Jane Mayer, Trump and Mountaire chicken processing, and exploiting "essential" (aka minority, immigrant, and low-income) workers: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/07/20/how-trump-is-helping-tycoons-exploit-the-pandemic So glad you are back!
Kind of assumed this sort of thing would be mostly automated by now.  I guess I kind of expected it to be like in a 90s cartoon, a long automated cutup line with a bunch of giant hammers and sawblades coming outta nowhere (I am that dumb yes).
Good suggestions AND you can also simply stop eating animals.
Real news instead of just talking about politics. I appreciate it.
Not only animals are abused but also the workers go thru mistreatment? Unfrigin real! Just watch a video on how animals are treated and you will stop eating meat. We don’t treat dogs like that.
and i was thinking europe was a bad place to live in people in china have better working conditions then the USA has to offer
Go vegan
I find the show pretty informative and enjoy watching it, but the jokes and analogies need a lot of work...
The people near the top of the hierarchy can sometimes be the most worthless and corrupt. The workers who actually do the work are treated inhumanely-  just because they are deemed "replaceable" with other vulnerable people. F'*** this world.
Is this episode about the backstreet boys reunion tour?
This is a rare case where it is justified to like or dislike this video equally Because the truth is excruciatingly painful. 16:09 is an absolute tragedy unlike nearly anything I've ever heard, and we have heard a lot.
Wow, talk about timely...   I was just offered a job at a local chicken processing plant as an occupational nurse. I can understand the frustration of the employees thinking we really can't do anything to help them and they are correct. All we are legally allowed to do is basic first aid (bandaids and Tylenol) and refer them to the weekly on-site doctor for chronic conditions. Obviously if there is an urgent situation we are the first ones to respond and have to call 911.   I would also be in charge of worker's comp claims, being told that I have to "weed out the fakers since no one really wants to do this job." Yeah, no shit. It's cold, wet, and they are constantly covered in chicken parts. Plus I got that casual racism vibe that's unfortunately very common down here in the deep South, as most of the workers are either minorities and ex-cons.   Definitely a lot to consider before I accept the offer.
Hey come to Finland, we got some work for u!

Good show.. but when I watched the birds get butchered, I gagged in front of my child...
Meatpackers are only going to get fucked over again when the next pandemic comes thanks to human's evil treatment of animals and evil companies.
BOICOT MEAT ALREADY What more proof do you need?  Torture, animal rights, social rights, illegality, deforestation, climate change...
Let's boycott these companies by just reducing our meat intake while also helping the environment, win win situation!
Lol 😂
Ah another segment on industrialized slavery. Man, this country stays true to its core principles!
America just being america. Always meat before humans. All praise god...
Now you understand where slogans like "seize the means of production" and "all power to the workers" come from.
At least he had the courtesy to put his gloves back on
Man, deregulation during Trump has been such a godsend
The US is such a fucking joke
I'm just hoping one day some big shot CEO see's John's video about his company...and apply his solutions in real life xD
Wow that's really eye opener

This may be the video that pushes me towards becoming a vegetarian (at least until the poor conditions these workers face are fixed).
The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights lists "the right to work in just and favourable conditions;" as a basic human right.
Capitalism the Base of America. Profits OVER People 🤔the GQP Base Donors TX the Seat of Capitalism 🤬
If people don't care about the horrible things that are done to animals to turn them into meat, or the fact that animal ag is playing a huge part in the destruction of the environment, should we really expect people to be appalled by the horrible conditions that meat plant workers face?
Welcome to America...
And here in a rational world you would have thought that Upton Sinclair writing The Jungle would have after a few Generations made this impossible.
You only have to look to China to find the solution. Most of these jobs are automated there. So the solution to avoiding providing these horrible jobs is just to eliminate them with automation. Now the hundred of thousands of workers may not like it, but on the other hand, there will be a save and human working enviroment.
We should all focus on finding meat alternatives and supporting brands that have a dedication to good work practices.
This companies should pay the price for all the damaged to their employees and to what we are getting on the table
you cant forget that any fines that the company may get will go against any bonus that they may give so that way in the end they don't really pay it
what the hell was that first commercial?
Mr. Oliver I love your show but man is it depressing for a comedy. That's not your fault. You could just retitle the show: The Way the World Really is w John Oliver and it would be just as accurate 😢

You could have written this about pretty much any manufacturing/production line job.
Pretty sure a simp like John Oliver has done very little meat packing in his life.
LOL poor guy's ratings are tanking now he doesn't have Trump to talk about.
JBS is heavily involved in corruption on the brazilian government, so I didn't expect something less than this.
and they say vegans only care about non-human animals. The human aspect was a huge part of it (I am vegan for all animals though, so no form of an. agriculture is justifiable, but I damn well know I don't need to fund industrial an. agriculture too).
So no more meat for the working class? That’s what you’re proposing. John... you lost me at 17 minute mark. The solutions you present are not practical. Social distancing for meet workers? C’mon man??? If you have been a white kid working at a fish processing plant in the summer making $15 to $20 an our, you know why these jobs exist and why people take them. It’s good money for a skill you can learn quickly an earn overtime easily. I expect my son to get a job when he is 14/15 but he won’t if the minimum wage is 15 bucks per hour.
i never trust a company that says "we're family". They WILL fuck you and wont even look you in the eye

Every fast food job I've had since Obama care was passed forces me to sign a waiver turning down Insurance in order to get enough hours to barely survive. With Covid I was forced to sign a piece of paper acknowledging that if at any point I felt unsafe because of the epidemic, I could not take advantage of unemployment.   The US is trash. I know when you work in the media, it may be hard to see. But its not just meat plants..... its everywhere. We *DONT* matter to our employers and thanks to a specific fascist political party that recently attempted to take over the government... we don't matter to the government either. We have no rights, and we will absolutely never receive them.  I keep saying, you can't both make life unbearable, and make suicide illegal. Pick one and only one.

I was wondering where he got photos of that animal porn.
Every time John Oliver says "What can we do here?" I hear "What will never be done?". Seriously, so many of these kind of stories, but never anything fixed afterwards.
Would that be slave labor?
Welcome to the United Corporate States of America.
This kind shit of stuff was all the reason I needed to go stop eating meat.
If you are into lying, cheating, bitterness, keeping malice, pride, manifesting anger, quarrelling, unforgiving, hatred, envy, contention, strife, bitterness, cursing, speaking evil of others, taking or giving bribe, selfishness, deception, kidnapping, smuggling, falsification of documents, swearing, extortion and other sinful character dispositions, you must repent (Colossians 3:5-9; Romans 1:29-32; Proverbs 6:16-19).  Such evil and wicked character will hinder the manifestation of God’s abundant blessings upon your life. If you are into lust, masturbation, fornication, adultery, prostitution (private or public), patronizing prostitutes, abortion, lesbianism, homosexuality, bestiality, watching pornography (I Corinthians 6:9-10), immoral thoughts or any act of immorality, you need to repent (Galatians 5:19-21; Mathew 5:28; Mark 7:21-23). Jesus loves you and wants to save you.  Visit this church, 'THE LORD'S CHOSEN CHARISMATIC REVIVAL MOVEMENT'.  www.tlccrm.org OR www.tlccrm.org/chosentvOR https://www.youtube.com/user/IamaChosen1  Are you into idolatry? Are you into cultism, whether open or secret cult? Do you practice witchcraft or Yoga? Do you smoke cigarette or cannabis? Do you sell them or offer them to people? Do you smoke or sniff hard drugs such as cocaine, heroin, captain black, hashish or other banned drugs or snuff? Are you lusting - lusting after men or women, covetous, alcohol drinking (proverbs 31:4-6)? You must repent, stop them and give your life to Jesus Christ. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.  Are you into marry and divorce? Then you are a sinner. Are you married to more than one person? Repent!! Marriage is between a man and a woman. Marriage is for better and for worse until death separates (Matthew 19:3-6). ‘Wherefore they are no more two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together let no man put asunder (separate)’. Cheating on your wife or husband is sin. Proverbs 28: 13 says, ‘‘He that covers his sins shall not prosper...You must repent of them, confess and forsake them (1 John 1:9).  Are you into worldliness? Don’t you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? (James 4:4; II John2:15-17). So, you must stop bleaching your body or painting your mouth, eyes, hands and legs or fixing attachments, weave-on, earrings (Genesis 35:2-4), bangles, chains and frying or perming your hair. Tattooing your body is satanic. Are you one of those that put on nude dresses, short skirts, transparent dresses to seduce men or women (a Seducer or a Promoter of lust is a Sinner – Mathew 5:28)   Perhaps you wear trousers as a woman? (Read Deuteronomy 22:5), that is an abomination (Revelation 21:8, 27). Therefore, make up your mind, repent and give your life to Jesus Christ. Are you spoilt? Jeremiah 4:30 says, ‘‘And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee. They will seek thy life’’. (2 Kings 9:30; Hosea 2:13; Exodus 33:1-6)  A Christian is not a Sinner and a Sinner is not a Christian (I John 3:9). If you must be a blessed child of God, then you must repent of your sins and give your life to Jesus Christ. If you believe Jesus Christ today, righteousness of God will come into your life and abundant life will be your portion (1 John 11-12). If you neglect this call to repentance and salvation and die, you will not escape fire of Hell (Hebrews 2:3). It is foolishness and sin to say or think that there is no God (Psalm 14:1; 9:17). Luke 13:3, Jesus said, ‘I tell you, Nay: but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish’. Cut off every besetting sin (Hebrew 12:1-2; Mark 9:43-48).   If you have decided now (2 Corinthians 6:2) to give your life to Jesus Christ and to forsake your sinful lifestyle, please say this prayer:  Almighty God, I come unto you in the name of Jesus. Father I confess that I am a sinner. All my sins I confess to you.  I am very sorry for all my sins (mention those you can remember). Lord I promise you that from today I will never continue in them anymore. I believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again on the third day for my justification.  Almighty God, use the blood of Jesus to wash my sins away. Lord Jesus, come into my heart, be my Lord and personal Saviour. I surrender my life to you. Cancel my name from the books of death and write it in the book of life. Give me power to sin no more. In Jesus name I pray. Amen!!

Conditions in meat processing facilities are so bad that somebody even wrote a book called 'The Jungle' about how bad it is in there.  Hopefully more people will read it and something will finally be done about that.
Grow your own food
i never thought of that the usa is such a shithole. srsly works dont have workers rights and they call it freedom and everything else communism. cant unterstand how brainwashed these citizens are
So, the woke dream is to provide free food for everyone while shutting down food production? Got it.
Meatpacking industries and Amazon must have gone to the same seminars.
#1 should b safety. I don't believe in unions but cases like this prove that they are needed. Basics in life. do unto others as u want done onto u. Money doesn't make a company successful ur employees do, the money will follow
This is what "Right to Work" gets you. Nothing good.
this was not a great video to watch during dinner
How can a consumer stop supporting these companies?  I know becoming vegan/vegetarian is the ultimate goal but for those that still prefer to eat meat. How can someone purchase ethically made meat and ethical work practices in their meat purchases.
Shame on those places
Another of the many great reasons to stop eating meat. Please.
automate and replace all of them... problem solved
Corporate office employees get pampered like fragile children while the dregs suffer in the plants. It's universal. Everything is fake and gay. It's always about appearances.

John is not funny anymore..maybe he never was.  He is the same as Hollywood, NBA, NFL.......Obsolete
Quite a commentary when it is our comedians who best point out the abuses in our work places! Let’s keep at this until there are laws which force action!
Oliver doesn't specifically name Northeast Alabama, but he might as well...My home county's biggest industry was chicken plants. They were miserable places to work, treated workers like dirt, they kept better paying jobs and opportunities out, and pollute the environment more than you'd think. Honestly, if your town can get ANY other jobs, you should do so.
You should do something on manufacturing in general. Many manufacturing companies push their employees to ridiculous degrees. Or like you covered around 13:00 the divide between treatment of white collar and blue collar workers.
That's the first commercial I've seen in years.
We decide with what we buy what happens in this world. Think before you spend a cent to the wrong guys... Buy local, organic etc
instead of taking out linconl statues, the people should close this companies!
In the 1970s, the meatpackers had the highest-paid factory jobs in America. The jobs were brutal, but unionized and mostly white blue collar workers. The companies moved the companies south and hired nonunion. They they bagan hiring immigrant workers at even lower pay. then they began hiring illegal immigrants at even lower pay. Then they donated to elected officials to create a visa worker just for them to hire more immigrants at even lower pay. people who say we need immigrants to do these terrible jobs are just pushing an open border corporate globalist narrative that destroys wages and job opportunities for American workers who used to do all of these jobs when they were not paid slave wages.  Oliver always pretends he is sticking it to the man. When it comes to immigration he is the man.
That commercial reminds me of an episode of The State on MTV. The "Snuggles" skit
But whisper that you might try to improve conditions and you are clearly a communist driving American jobs overseas... Well, maybe these jobs need to be driven overseas.  I bet they can't in all cases, though, and they could actually be forced to make this safer, but then, oh no, meat prices would go up!  Perish the thought!  We might have to eat less meat!!! 😱
Anyone else prefer him in the void? he gets to the point... not as many stupid prop jokes... and no laugh track from the audience or forced laugh que's.
When will we address the issue of why production lines are experiencing high volumes? Do we ignore our increasingly unsustainable demand for meat?
The absent iris gradually tap because cellar repressingly stare around a special maria. scarce, kind security

As long as people keep buying cheap meat, these conditions will continue to exist.
John Oliver has obviously not worked as a member of management in a union shop. Management is charged with following the workers around cracking the whip and writing up violations, while labor hides and slacks off whenever and wherever they can. Not all, but a lot. It's a game they play so leadership from both sides can sit down at the table once a month and trade violations for grievances. Totally unproductive and a waste of time, but that's life in a union shop.
Namaste.
That's the shit you should be demonstrating on instead of pulling down statues and stuff. You got distracted by people who don't want you to endanger their game.
If that guy peed on the line, there must be pee buckets 🪣 and they all do it!  I 80% only buy local. Now as I move towards 100% I’m gonna double check the working conditions of all the local farms and not just how the animals are treated.  Thanks for this post!

All y’all anti vegans who say “WHAT ABOUT HUMANS?!”, let’s see if you’re gonna boycott this disgusting industry who does so much damage to other animals, to us and to the environment.
If I didn't have obligate carnivore pets, I'd be just fine never buying meat again.
John stopped being satirical news commentator and became straight up investigative journalism news anchor.
Great. So it's bad enough I have to feel horrible about the animals. Now I have to feel horrible about the humans too?
In Germany we do not employ those workers. Instead they are self-employed. They have to rent the equipment from the slaughter house, life in together with other workers in the same room, and do not get health insurance (which would have been necessary if they were employed, as this is mandatory in Germany). As no German would work under these conditions, these workers come from eastern European countries which are associated with or part of the EU. If they get sick, they are send back home.

It’s a bribocracy, what does anyone expect here? Seriously, the U.S. is an obnoxiously stupid mess of fucking dumb. I gotta find some way to stop eating meat.
I'd love to work for Osha yet I have never seen any recruiting information about them. I once worked for an incredibly cheap boss.  He refused to spend extra on anything. Cheap fixes all the way. The "warehouse" I was working for door collapsed down on top of me one day. Luckily I was in caged forklift. He wanted me to put it back together. I've never worked on one and knew it could be dangerous tensioning the spring. Spring was massive and over 40 years old, nearly slipped on me multiple times. That entire warehouse was just a fire waiting to happen. I've had other bad experiences in different workplaces. Employers know osha just isnt going to show up to enforce anything.
Oh and lets not forget getting tossed into the freezer when you get hurt to either make you quit, or to claim your not injured anymore, and then fired when the pain shows up again.
Just a fun fact, im throwing in there...no particular reason. 🤣🤣🤣  Keep doing what you do
the only meat packing you need to do is with your butt buddy Biden you liberal hack!

Immigrants are in the jobs because natives are comfortable not working.  Here is a solution: no welfare unless working. 4 hour shift work at chicken plant. For those that complain workers are not paid enough; you are the ones that complain about $1 chicken nugget.
1500 with COVID 19: 8 dead?? 0.5%, what happened to the other 2.5% that were supposed to die? Sounds like health care at Chicken Plant is pretty good? Perhaps the reason infection rate is so high is because the minorities you state are nuclear families with high levels of interaction based upon their cultural norms? Multu-generational plant workers?
Americans, you have to realize that every major industrialized country in the world has a national health insurance plan (UK, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Taiwan...). People do not lose their homes paying for overpriced healthcare. It is a human right and healthy democracies treat all citizens equally. The US is the weird exception, where Republicans have brainwashed many to think it is some kind of socialism (if so, then all insurance is, but it isn’t; who owns health?). Second, the Republicans stand for deregulation, which means that Trump and his ilk want to eliminate OSHA and all agencies that would hold companies to healthy standards, as this video shows. “OSHA has to be rebuilt” means stop electing Republicans who are for maximum profits for companies, not the well-being of the poor workers who work like slaves in such shitty conditions. This is 2021. Learn from the pandemic or die.
Why are so many people in this story grossly overweight? The managers, the workers, even the TV morning show ladies in Michigan?
The entire point of life: Jesus did not come to be served, but to serve. Mathew 20: 28. We are no different. This entire life is a representation of the spiritual warfare going on. Good vs evil. God isn't a flying man in the sky, but the actual representation of Love, Hope, Joy, Peace, Light, etc. Not metaphor, but literally, like an extra demintional wavelength of thought, emotions, and intent. The devil is the opposite wavelength, pain, fear, hate, anger, darkness, etc. Human life is serving one of these two. Not a man in the sky, actual sentient collective universal Love. However, humans are primatives, we make mistakes. It's in our nature, since the fall, to go down the wrong path. This means at some time each one of us has served darkness to some degree. God understands our limited understanding of our own actions, so he gave us forgiveness, though sacrificing himself in human form as Jesus Christ. It is our duty to accept that sacrifice, get the forgiveness, and be better, helping others be better, and spreading this wavelength of Love, Hope, Joy, Peace, Light, etc, thoughout the universe. But God had to make a way for us to get to this place spiritually, this is why evidence is not allowed. Evidence will make you believe, using the fear of absolute punishment to change your behavior, but that won't make you better, just scared. Faith makes you better. It is what redeemes us, not our works. Faith is the hope that things get better, that justice always prevails, that we're at least loved by our creator. But it has to be Faith in Jesus, because of his sacrifice. And there can't be evidence to point us to him, because Love had to be fair. If there were a code in our DNA, what about everyone born before genetic sequencing? If there were a book with the solar system thosands of years ago, what would stop an evil person from hiding/destroying it? If it were something you had to go to, what about the geographically isolated, imprisoned, or enslaved. If it were a train of logic, what about the uneducated, or mentally slow? Not to mention all the people born before schools. Love cannot give to one without giving to the other. So the key to salvation had to be something everyone has access to. The only thing is Faith. This is why God puts it upon your heart to learn about these things, even if it's only to criticize, or hate. God is everywhere, because Love is everywhere, and so is the devil, because hate is everywhere. They're in your head all the time, regardless of weather or not you accept that. They whisper inside your heart, giving you ideas. But more than that, they're inside everyone's heart. This is how they get things done. They corrordanate us like pieces on a chess board. The only difference is, we get to chose who's side we're playing for. At the end of our life, we go to that team's home base, Heaven, or Hell. A place where all that exists is those wavelengths. Hate, pain, anger, fear, darkness; or Love, Hope, Joy, Peace, Pleasure, Light. The choice is yours to make. But you cannot go to Heaven with hate in your heart. You must forgive, repent, and spread joy for those around you. These are sentient eternal controlling forces in our universe. Heaven and Hell are very real places, I've seen them. Those steps prime your soul for a meeting with God. Very literally. Once you've done all four, in that order, you get divine revelation, with all the evidence you'll ever need. They are, forgive your parents, brake down before Jesus, ask for forgiveness, and read the Bible. Step four takes three books to get the revelation. I recommend Genesis, Mathew, and then either Luke, Psalms, or proverbs. The order of the steps is important, step 1 has to come before step 3. I can state that for an absolute certainty that these steps always work. Please, take your salvation seriously. See for yourself. Do those steps. Jesus Christ is Lord. It's all True,

Why not educate people on the option to not eat meat? At least give those who are willing to make a change the information they need to switch to a healthy plant-based lifestyle. In my experience, the majority of people are unaware that it is even an option (as they believe that meat is essential, when it isn't), and even those who are aware often feel it isn't a realistic option, because they don't know how to do it (and so they don't even try). Just giving people information on how to eat plant-based could ease the pressure on the meat packing industry (by encouraging those who are willing to go plant-based).
Pro DNC show, poor journalism that focuses on left wing ideas. Very annoying host that should be deported
just go fucking vegan HBO and John Oliver!
If you have the time and if you have a twitter account please use #DontKillItBernie with this message "Bernie Sanders, as Chair of the Budget Committee, decides what goes in the COVID relief bill. It's his decision on whether a $15-per-hour minimum wage is included in the bill or not. If he keeps it in, it forces the Democrats to vote on it and means it has a chance of passing. If he takes it out, it means Bernie Sanders is killing the increase in minimum wage himself.  We, the undersigned, have a clear message: Don't kill it Bernie!"  and sign this petition: https://tyt.com/petitions/dontkillitbernie  If Joe Manchin and Kristen Sinema are threatening to kill the stimulus bill over a 15$ min wage, we must call their bluff. In order for us to do that, the 15$ min wage MUST stay within the bill! Please urge Bernie as the Chair of the Budget Committee to not take the 15$ minimum wage, as this action will be used to throw him under the bus the moment corporate dems get the opportunity to do so.
Imagration amnesty and no border enforcement turned packinghouse jobs to shit in the 80's before that they were good paying jobs with little turnover
Miss Piggy has a sex tape and this is the first time I'm hearing about it? Also, who won the betting pool?
I always feel so bad as a human after watching John's show
danggggggggggggggg its still just as horridly bad as ud never give time to imagine yep. but for real its like one of those things where either we outright ban corporate lobbying in our republic politics and pray or we just give up and wait for it to implode so hard that we get flipped back to home gardens to survive
Okay, I genuniely feel sorry forr workers in these meat packing plants.  But I work at AMAZON, and at least 20,000 of us tested positive for the Covid - and that was way back in Ocotober last year!  Who knows how many of us by end of February 2021, right?  I've voluntarily tested 4 times, and so far clean.  But I have lots of friends that have gone missing for a couple weeks only to have been out sick with this dreaded virus.  There's hardly a week or two that goes by, our Hub doesn't inform us of more associates that tested positive.  Honestly - it scares the crap out of you working under such fearful conditions as these.  We comply with all sorts of extreme government safety protocols, but you try wearing a mask every second at your very physical job in 10- and 11-hour shifts.  Mentally, you feel like your gagging, or even suffocating; but physically, nauseousness and persistent headaches - probably from inability to breath freely.  Fun fact:  Around Christmas, we had a nearby sister plant close entirely due to such large numbers of Covid-infected workers.  So yea, be afraid - be very afraid to work indoors around thousands of coworkers.
Amazon falls in the same category
this show is so informative and so stressful. gives me a new thing to be anxious and upset about every single time
You know what is really sad? Is that as a Researcher, and after looking at the available Covid-19 data in June of 2020, I personally contacted several federal, state, and county agencies to warn them that potential new Covid-19 Variants from Zoonotic transmission. I thought  it could be the reason for the high density and lethal Covid cases in meat processing plants. I specifically asked if they were monitoring and testing animals used for food. I also asked if Covid could be spread if you came in contact with bodily fluids of Covid infected humans and animals. No was the answer I always got. Then we later find out that 10,000 minks (used to make expensive coats and hats) were killed here in the US because they contracted Covid and when it bounced back to the workers it was a crap in your pants and your buddy's pants scary mean Covid Variant. Same thing happened in Denmark and the UK! In July 2020 an animal  conservation group asked the UK government to eradicate all the American Mink species because they were an invasive species in UK. In one instance, when they killed the minks and buried the animals the government made the Mink Farmers dig back up all those rotting Minks and they had to burn everything! No hides to turn into a coat!   So back to meat processing plants... The workers who became infected at the Meat Processing Plants and went to the store, restaurant, or home to the wife & kids and mom and dad  these workers became super spreaders of potentially new Covid variants. Remember, each time Covid-19 gets into an animal Covid adjusts (or mutates) itself to this new type species of life! And when it's transmitted back from animals to humans it can mutate even more. Even after 1 year no public studies have been done to determine what Covid variant each Meat Processing Plant Worker who got infected had. Nor has there been any public studies and testing of each animal that got processed. A sample of blood and some lung tissue from each would help defend everyone from a new variant of Covid!    Sad... Very Sad!
let me throw another idea...... just STOP EATING SO MUCH MEAT people... And no I am neither vegan nor vegetarian. The average american eats more than 200 pounds of meat per year... That's ridiculous! you don't need so much meat.  less consumption, less production, as simple as that...
Stop eating meat.
Makin me want to go vegan
Couldn't OSHA staffing issues be resolved by seeding individuals already on staff or intent on taking a position in production with OSHA guidelines training? There could be designs on compensation that don't encourage false claims nor permit the companies from undermining their covert observation. Our intelligence services are empowered to infiltrate where there is need to, handling informants who are willing to act in accordance with the government. What good is OSHA if it can't be and underhanded bastard?
Can anyone here share his/her idea on a better investment to go into right now that will profit me so well

ugghhh i love this show and have been watching these youtube clips for several years. but idk if i can anymore. Shit just makes me angry and sad....
First useful story I’ve ever heard from you. Must be some propaganda angle here since it’s coming out of your mouth, but I’ll give credit where credits due.
1,500 by 8. So .53333333% of there work force died of covid. And they can't even shell out for that, wow.
WTF?
I buy my meat halal, alhamdulillah
And when all of this is done, and the price of meat doubles or triples, and Americans eat less meat, we'll have not just safer meatpacking workers, but we'll also have done something about climate change.
Before you have a night of fun, remember that a pervy owl is always watching. Just.... watching.
a few managers of a company added money and levity to a deathly pandemic. wow tyson is terrible amiright/s. gtfoh what does that have to do with anything.
we should stop buying meat!
So meatless meat can change this?
the same humans that go and work for this shit and eat this shit are the same ones asking for change but it's quite obvious their actions show otherwise(and that applies to all  industries) .. looking at people and their personal motives is like watching addicts telling everyone one the conditions they do their dope in is extremely poor no never mind they need to stop the dope addiction aka industrial farming in the first place LMFAO there is much to be said for people willing to buy the rope to hang themselves with..

And keep in mind that a Covid relief bill wasn't passed at the end of the last administration because Mitch McConnell wanted to add additional protection for employers who get sued by employees who contract Covid at work. Lack of regulation helps the super rich to squeeze what little remains to squeeze out of the rest of us. And we vote for these people. It's surreal.
Fishing for new material?  Trump is not the president any more, so you cannot talk about him...
Every plant and industrial production site should have an assigned at least one on-site inspector, and those inspectors should be rotated every week.  The industries involved should be required to pay, out of their gross profits, the costs of maintaining the inspections, including salaries.

I work for Hello Fresh and I can tell you personally it is highly comparable to this. We actually just got a in faculty nurse last week. No other episode hit as personally as this one.
No call to action at the end, surprising
We need to make sure this show stay around and continues to operate to bring light to our society...
And America disses China for " human rights violations" time to stop the hypocrisy
I'll never buy Tyson or Pilgrims Pride ever again.
They are a family just a abusive family
These people do not understand how the manufacturing lines work. One worked does not process the whole 45 pcs during one minute but rather he or she does only their part in this process, which can be cutting off a leg or the wing and such. It's like saying that GM's factory makes one car per minute and attributing that to one single worker. It doesn't work like that. Now, if they can't get a bathroom break, that's a shame though. That's not right
Another reason not to eat meat loll
Go go you Jhon

sometimes i really wonder why John wanted to immigrate to America of all places
solution...Boycott these companies.
This is a third world country
USA - The land of the free "Slaves"
They open a lot of these centers in rural areas where there aren't any other jobs.
Go Veggy 👍🥦🫐🍚
Once again I'm so happy I don't live in America
The ironi of unfiar condetion for workers that are killing animals. In are place called slaughterhouse. Just let that sink for a min.
Stories like this make me want to go vegan - and then I learn how agricultural workers are treated, or how my clothes are made. Time to go live in a forest naked foraging for nuts and berries - that is until developers level the forest. ☹ 🔫
The best country of the world? Dream on!
Well, and here i complain about my work conditions lol... is like 100 times better then these US workers have. Sucks to be murican~
USA citizens are being poisoned in so many ways. If the food, air and/or water does not kill us, the vaccines and medications (and most doctors) will. Why is no one alarmed that doctors 'practice' medicine or that the symbol for medicine is a snake? They are putting what they are right in our faces. A physician's asst student told my friend, 'the best way to stay healthy is to not go to a doctor for any reason.' Two very close relatives of mine are case managers/RNs for a very well known health insurance company; neither go to doctors. All of this speaks volumes to me.
Ah john oliver your show is so good hbo gave it to youtube for nothing. You did some good work in the show community.
so glad you are back Mr. Oliver
Not just USA, similar situations in Europe.  I am not a vegetarian but I rarely overcome my conscience and buy meat.
Reminds me of futurama... "I don't think of this as a business. I think of it as a source of cheap labor. Like a family."
@lastweektonight Can you please make one more episode on India, modi, farmer’s ongoing protest, biased media there and effects of tweets from Greta, Rihanna. Jailing Disha Ravi for making toolkit.

Me: Hey John the sky is blue, but only during the day. John: Holy shit!
Please John do another segment on Mexico, our current government is a comedic gold mine, from the way they’re handling the pandemic to their infrastructure “projects” to raffling the presidential airplane to supporting a RAPIST as a candidate for governor   I really wish I was making this stuff up
One of my friends works in one of these places, and I worry about him every day. I feel like this video was just barely scratching how bad it is in there.  My friend made a comment about counting his days once, and I can't forget it.
If work is that bad, why still work there though ??
You should do an episode on 2600 magazine and how it effected hacking, coding, and the internet today. Don't forget the l0pht.
"Our company is more like a family" is code for "we're gonna fuck you over. hard."
These conditions are happening in other food manufacturing plants including those that pack frozen dinners and veggies. Avoid all processed foods as much as you can.
More and more I learn about USA it feels more and more a third world country.

This is literally what the entire book ,*The Jungle* was about. Glad to see 1906 is making a come back.
Open borders will solve all this.  They need to change jobs to solar panel manufacturing.
Seeing who they hire and looking at the amount of black & hispanic employees, perhaps the root of it all are the police and justice system. Progress remains too slow.
"What can we do?"   Maybe, just maybe, stop eating animals should be a good idea?
Humor is the new logic.
WHO WOULD IMAGINE THAT COMPANIES THAT KILL BILLIONS OF ANIMALS EVERY YEAR COULD BE SO UNETHICAL RIGHT?!??!!?
Pipe down on the sexual jokes, they are unnecessary and not funny.
It's no secret how dirty the meat industry is, so why not just go vegan?
I always roll my eyes whenever I see company propaganda claiming that their workers are "family" while underpaying their staff and generally not giving a fuck about their workers. This has been true at every single companies I work at including my current one.

Am I even legally allowed to say this?  Why don't we just "get rid of" these monsters?  Pretty sure you've forfeited your right to live when your favorite hobby is collecting money off the pain, and literal mortality, of others.
This is pretty much true of most production work: I started a factory job last Fall and didn't last 2 weeks. I shat myself because there was no one to substitute for me. We were taking staggered breaks to catch up on backlog and working through "normal" break-time. I've gotta go, I look out and there are no blue-shirts, nobody; they're all on break.  When I would get home, I'd open the car door and move to try & get out... body don't work. And instead, I'd just flop back in the seat and sleep in the car. About a week and a half in,  I can't take this anymore.  I'm letting the team down, I can't keep up, I'm getting buried.
BIG SOLUTION: How about you just stop buying the shit that kills you anyway!
No wonder capitalism started with the conveyor belt. When profits are based on reducing time, and when time is more important than people.
The betting pool is hilarious. I would have thrown in my money. John... not so funny. Just terrible at irony, allegory, anachronism, metaphors, imagery and humor.   I want my time back but the worth of watching this video is less than two rat craps.
Keep eating cheap meat, this is important to keep up our Western Lifestyle!

Don’t eat meat. If you do, don’t eat much, and buy it from a small, reputable farm. Or, better yet, hunt it yourself.
I literally stoped buying all Tyson products after the betting pool hit the news. No, firing them doesn't fix anything, how do you hire that many psychopaths in the first place. At the very least, it was already acceptable behavior in your corporate culture. I generally avoid Texas made products as the only reason companies move there is because the state doesn't enforce employee rights. Be wary of any company relocating there, they're avoiding standards along with taxes.
Corporate fines should always be assayed as a percentage of total company revenue. The minimum fine for a non-accidental violation of a law or rule should be 1% and the maximum should be 100%. Certain types of violation should come with a mandatory minimum level of fine. For example if they cause a fatality through a previously known but not fixed safety hazard they should have to pay 10% of revenue or a hundred thousand dollars, whichever is greater. If they expose a bunch of employees to known chemical hazards without informing them or providing them with safety equipment and they get seriously sick; 50% or a million, whichever hurts the CEOs bonuses the most.  Oh, and the should be a law in place that no company executive can get a bonus in a year where the company has been fined a percentage of their revenue. Maybe also force them to move the maximum amount of money that they could be fined into escrow whilst the company is defending their actions in court, that way it hurts as much as possible as soon as possible and might cause companies to want a speedy trial, thus keeping costs down for the agency issuing the fine. No need to waste taxpayer money after all.
Maybe Tyson meat is made from mutant guenie pigs....

so now openly you do virtue signaling!
yeah! wow! I work in manufacturing and we are treated 1 million times better than this.
I'd rather have my meat from a wet market in Wuhan, then from one of the american dream factories.
Need to force all these politicians who don’t support workers rights to do a few weeks labor on the line in one of these meat packing plants.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.

Imagine suffering the loss of a family member & having to fight for justice against a corporate organisation on top of your personal grief.
It's very interesting, that meatpacking and generally butchering is often connected with awful working conditions - as if something is fucked up with the whole industry and pricing of meat. There have also been several cases of corona-related revelations of violations of work safety and health here in germany.  This shit needs to be unfucked :(
DAmn those peeps are fucking savages.
yup yup yup I agree with all that is said they just add more and more bull
I work in food industry. Do you want your food to be cheap? Do you want them to be safe? Yes? The svaings have to come somewhere. Now you know who suffers for low prices. Automation would help but it will increase the cost, by quite a bit, which you consumers will complain and switch to competition. Food industry is really cut throat and margins are low. Just some perspectives.
This pandemic is showing a lot of Americans how little they matter in the corporate meat grinder.  Shame how much nihilism there is among them.
will you press the button  meatpacking workers are treated nicely  BUT your meat prices triples
Heh. AP Human Geography Fast Food nation moment.

Dammit tyson's chicken nuggets are so good but the company is so shit what do i do nooooo this is a crisis i dont wanna support assholes but then if you think about it all big companies suck at their core so is it really making a difference switching from one company to another you're just giving your money to a different asshole instead so DOES IT EVEN MATTER

So much truth. 6.5 years working for Tyson and after reporting a deadly situation that was handled wrong by management 4 separate times in 2 weeks with me and other coworkers lives on the line I was fired, while looking for another job, I ran into a friend who I worked with at Tyson for at least 3 to 4 years was looking for a job. When I asked what happened they said they went to their own doctor because of extreme wrist pain that they've had for 9 months straight Tyson fired that person on the spot. So Tyson didn't have to pay for their carpal tunnel surgery.  Also had another friend die after company doctor rushed them back to work after an on the job injury. Doc released them to return to work the next day, that night died from blood clot from the injury.   This video bought up so many experience stories about my time there.   Glad I got out even if it was thrown down a slide and the corporate investigation that was started fell apart after they got rid of me and Osha said I could no longer make a claim of unsafe work conditions because I was not currently employed .  O memories.

At the onset of the pandemic, a plant in Columbus Junction, IA shut down after 17 people tested positive for COVID-19. The other workers were sent to Waterloo, IA so that they wouldn't loose hours. Spoiler alert, they weren't healthy, and the Waterloo plant shut down soon after.

This kind of exploitation is also a good reason to tighten down on illegal immigration. I know it sounds fucked but hear me out. People who are here illegally deserve rights and deserve respect, as they are human beings. But being here illegally inherently makes them less likely to complain about mistreatment, and also makes them unable to really resort to any real legal recourse. Additionally, a constant flow of cheap(and easily frightened into compliance) labor allows these companies to get away with paying slave wages and maintaining horrible working conditions. Supply and demand. No matter how you dice it, its better for the immigrants themselves to come here legally. Closing off the border would be better for immigrants(Latino immigrants). It would lead to corporate pressure to reform immigration from these same corporations to restore the flow of cheap labor, while also ensuring that same labor was here legally and able to seek proper legal representation without fear of deportation. Call it "Malicious compliance" with the anti-immigration policies of the republicans.
Shes a fucking treasure.... PERIOD!
Please stop conflating immigrants with illegal immigrants...
Horrible. Too bad that the twitter snowflakes don't care about REAL people getting hurt... And that story is also why lobbying is called corruption anywhere outside of USA...
I'd argue most workers in most larger American corporations are treated horribly and are generally exploited.
Evil county
The boss or CEO of a company should only be allowed to make 30% more than its employees.
I read a book while in jail for consuming, by choice, illegal chemicals like cocaine and heroin as opposed to the LEGAL chemicals in our air that I would rather NOT ingest like the mercury, formaldehyde, lead arsenic etc like we get from fossil fuels, and it was entitled "Fast Food Nation"..... other than the abhorrent things described by John here, this book pointed out that chicken feces were fed to cattle and cattle feces were fed to chickens that were being sold for human consumption......and people wonder why i go for that silly "free range" hoax food.
"If the penalty for a crime is a fine, then that law only exists for the lower class."
Comedy without crowds kinda suck ngl
Being a former worker at a meat packing plant I can say this is all true
I always find these so interesting, as they inform me about things that I never considered. Its shines light about how ignorance is bliss though, now I feel I should not buy Tyson chicken. But that won't really have any sort of impact...
I work in an industry that had to cut production due to covid. Our customers are super pissed about the lack of supply.  Imagine $10/pound prices for chicken that is rarely even available. How would the public react to that? You can reduce production, sure, but people will have to eat less also.   Try telling people they can't eat because the producers can't produce. Let me know who that goes over.
This country thinks seven dollars an hour is a living wage while touting we are number one in the world.  It’s just modernized slavery.

Calling this piece "meatpacking" is 100% accurate and 100% false advertisement, simultaneously. I am *slightly* disappointed.
Brilliant, and hilarious, as always.  And such an important and concerning issue.  Thanks.
Why can’t they and won’t they unionize? Also robots...
How can a company tell a government agency in charge of workers safety to put a bag over their head to go through a factory? And why on earth would he agree to that? In ANY other first world country the factory would be shut down until a proper inspection was passed AND fined massively on top of that. This is absolutely absurd!
I'm not going to watch this. I already know about the meat industry.  I am assuming John Oliver is eating Bill Gates meat already. 🤮
Jesus is this America or China wtf
This is like....FOXCONN...
Why aren't you funny anymore? The journalism is wonderful but your childish and simplistic obvious jokes are just embarrassing. Stick to journalism or make the comedy good again.
Thank you for covering this!!!
just watched this again.. outrageous! I wonder what society in 3031 will think of us now. 🥴
So yes...that is indeed  problem... so what can we do about it? Should we all just go vegan? Seems as impossible to avoid as Amazon at this point.
Since I watched this video I keep getting Tyson ads.
I thought that what sailors do.
whelp...time to try and be vegetarian again fuck
Who built the cages BOE ?
I felt personally attacked by that Emerson blended joke.
So thankful you are working to get the truth out
Yikes, we all knew it was bad, but many truckers say Tyson is great to work for.  Easy to socially distance on the road...
The worst part about this is that none of this is news to those in power, but nothing is ever done about it because people complain when the price of meat per pound is too high. No one complains about worker's safety when the price of chicken is $0.99/pound.
I hate this world and the greed that crawls upon it..
11:35 explains why so many companies are moving to Texas
Let's not beat around the bush either:  Meatpacking employees are just one segment of the employed who have suffered and been denied compensation during the pandemic.  You also have your grocery cashiers/stockmen/sales associates, your public transit workers, your mail carriers/package delivery specialists, and a whole slew of other workers.  I mean Kroger is choosing to close stores rather than follow through with local laws demanding hazard pay for workers being exposed to a deadly infection that has killed more than 500,000 people in America when Kroger's minimum wage is a paltry sub $15 an hour.
Another reason to go vegan
I used to work in a meat packing plant and I can say that this is absolutely true.  They have destroyed unions and do constant union prevention. My brother simply told the truth about working conditions to OSHA and was almost fired ford it. I can tell you right now that there are very few people who have the enduring spirit to work more than a week in these plants and those who can manage are treated like trash.
what if the workers just owned the company
My older brother worked in a meat packing plant. He died there in a work related incident.
The bouncy quicksand conversely label because cheese conversly impress regarding a gamy tabletop. yellow, upset tail
This is a textbook example of why we need strong unions.
There was a liquid nitrogen leak at a poultry plant in Gainesville, GA, earlier this year. It killed six people, but a lot of the immigrant workers didn't seek medical help. In fact, they fled the site for fear of deportation. This plant, though, had received 12 OSHA violations in 2015 alone (including two employees losing fingers), and more all the way up to 2020. I haven't heard anything else about this plant or the incident or what happened to the employees who didn't seek help since then. I suspect I never will. Here's the story  https://www.npr.org/2021/01/29/961923732/6-killed-after-liquid-nitrogen-leak-at-georgia-poultry-plant
Not just meat packing but most production facilities are like this
I love to watch this show anytime my blood feels a little too warm and not enough curdled.
Ive seen more news coverage on tiger woods car accident in the last two days than on the meat packing industry in the last two decades. Sad state of reporting nowadays.
Claxton's industry leaders say the plan that could lower the prison's population numbers could raise their needed employee totals.  "We'd like to hire all our workers locally, but there are positions we have to fill and there just aren't enough people that want to do the job," explained Claxton Poultry's Jerry Lane.  https://www.wtoc.com/story/6557078/prison-inmates-to-work-in-industries/  So, prisoners will do since normal people want rights.
Go plant-based and you'll be healthier and more satisfied that you're not giving money to this industry.
Capitalism at its worst evilness! What do you expect from a country that started from enslaving people!!
Oliver should thank the USA for providing so much good (bad) material for his shows.  Why is the US looking worse everyday?
What are people's opinions on what should be done as an individual to make their lives better? Regulations on limits they can impose on workers? The demand for meat is very high (I imagine) so they would need to hire more to meet it but do they have the budget to do so? With regulations in place, would this force some number people in the country into veganism if it increases the price of meat? Maybe automation of some sort becomes a thing or plant based meats explode at this point if it becomes quickly manufacturable, where do the workers go?

Remember when Republicans wouldn't vote for the stimulus bill unless a law was added that would keep anyone from suing a company that forced them to work in Covid conditions then they caught the virus from that? Pepperidge Farm remembers.
If we are not willing to pay more for meat to ensure the wellbeing of our fellow man, we do not deserve the food in our mouths.
What? Behind the guinea pig?
John coming with the heat and I miss his audiences. He’s stuck in the void
JBS was (is) involved in many political scandals in Brazil, with charges of bribes to former Presidents, quality controls issues and a lot more.
this may as well be about the majority American factory jobs
Your boss has opposing interests to you — they’re not family.
Has John made a video about soybeans? Soybeans get a lot of criticism as unhealthy for human consumption yet the majority of soybeans are grown to feed the livestock that are raised for meat.
Same story, but replace USA with China
It's not just the meat packing industry. If you work in any sort of plant, factory, or warehouse...you are a disposable resource. I have worked in the manufacturing industry for over 20 years and have experienced some horrendous working conditions. These industries will work you to death and then throw you out like the garbage that they think that you are.
Who won the bet though?
Pervert owls. Woo woo!
And "Team Member".. been saying this for years, labor standards in this country are garbage.
Americans being americans...

You know John Oliver is speaking truth to power when he pauses to say "Now...  LEGALLY, I have to tell you...."
Sitting here in socialist Denmark with my popcorn, free healthcare, free school system, five weeks of company paid vacation each year and where meat package workers earn 4885 $ a month and watching the freak show they call "Land of the Freeeeee".. but at least they got guns in this show which seems like a fair trade off
😞
Thank you, John Oliver, for highlighting  another important and under-reported topic! I agree that this topic is NOT talked about enough, and would argue that the animals suffering at meat plants are also NOT talked about enough. The food industry is horrendous at every corner, and what is coming to light in your footage is beyond appalling. I wonder if people who watch this continue their meat consumption as usual, or if some consumers are changing and eat less of these inhumanely-processed products.
D i s q u s t i n g!  Scratching the surface in the land of the brave and the free......
Upton Sinclaire described production workers peeing in the slaughterhouses of chicago in the 1930's. Nothing has changed!
John Oliver does a pretty excellent job with his sarcastic presentation of some pretty serious issues to consider. I, for one, will never buy another Tyson Meat product until I hear that the company has corrected the error of its ways. (I'm not holding my breath on that one.)  The staff cuts at OSHA and the IRS, to name just a couple of government agencies, were initiated under Republican presidencies. Banging the "smaller government" gong, they cut a shitload of positions that check on various industries and taxpayers... and so what do you expect to happen after that? If nobody's looking, those not being checked go off the grid in their illegal activities. The heads of major corporations donate a boatload of dough to GOP candidates across the nation because they know they'll get something for their money. It's "Pay to Play" and it works... so it continues.
The weirdest thing is when people place it on public media this is their working condition and almost nobody politically cares. I know a lot of Americans hate Government and lobby against as little Government control 99% of the time. But if a company can act like this you can use your government to enforce government to have at least some form of ethics. Companies won't do that, they have no incentive. Just a tiny little bit of ethics instead of this absolutely low bar. That's what we do in my European Capitalistic country.
Land of the free!
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.

Straight up. No matter where you work, your bosses and managers do NOT care about you.
The rich should read Christmas Carol
Yet another reason to go vegetarian.
I just want to thank the whole production team and everyone responsible for last week tonight for making free content that is incredibly educational exposing massive amounts of flaws in the systems we live in. Truly heroic in the society we live in today.
Land of the free, right? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Oh, you need to take a toilet break? Just wear diapers and a feeding bag so you can keep working. Better yet, learn how to continue working while you're sleeping so yo never have to go home and just keep doing your job and slave away for your bosses 24/7! /s

Don't eat meat, and if you do, don't eat shit meat that's cheap. Problem solved, move along.

DAMN! I hardly recognized John Oliver! He looks like he has aged 20 years since 2016 when he was sticking his foot in his mouth with his little "Do it!" dare to Trump. Goofy Brit! Maybe it's just all the extra new fat that makes him look so much older.
All this money that these companies and executives have... and now our politicians too.... maybe they should all retire??  Or maybe politicians could do their jobs and everyone would have more money to pump into the economy. It's not a great plan to let ,01% of the country have 80% of the wealth and just sit on it...
The solution: Stop buying Tyson products. They have no intention of ever treating their hourly works with respect or dignity and their political ties run deep so they will never be held accountable.
I wish John would call for a boycott of meat and all associated products from the biggest manufacturers. Hit them in the wallet and they’ll start paying attention. But he didn’t . When you eat your sandwich tonight, think about the thousands of workers who were forced to make the meat supply chain work in harsh conditions just so you can enjoy your bite .
....not to mention employers can take out life insurance policies on their employees. Incentive to make sure to poorly train and enforce safety measures!
The USA is a Hollywood Film

OMAHA!!!

Something we saw in my state was small towns that primarily relied on meat packing plants for jobs had the highest percent of cases throughout the pandemic regardless if people worked there because workers were going home and getting their friends and family's sick. this totally destroyed their medical centers and pushed them to get help in the city witch was hours away. there were more active cases in some of these small towns then there was in our biggest metro area with over a million in population. i really feel for our small town folks. these companies basically destroyed their towns and communities and seem to have gotten away  with it :/
It's crazy how far behind USA is when it comes to this kind of things. Hopefully they will catch up with the rest of the western world.  "Keep them poor and they will fight for scraps. They will have to many problems in their life to do something about it." Think i read it somewhere 🤔
Fuck, man. I remember when you were still funny.
Another day in America.

It's 2021 and time to ditch meat, folks. This industry is filled with unimaginable amounts of human and animal exploitation. 70 BILLION slaughtered every year for meat. The industry is a massive contributor to climate change and is unsustainable. Disease comes from and spreads in meat production. We got the swine flu from pigs, the bird flu from poultry, and covid has spread in these meat plants like nowhere else.  All signs point in the same direction: Ditch meat. Today. We cannot support this industry any further, and the alternatives available are better than ever.
THIS IS WHY I DON'T EAT MEAT ........
What can we do? Stop buying their shitty product!
Tfw your mom says you have Upton Sinclair at home
Why are we surprised that the abuse isn't limited to the animals?
"just let the market regulate itself", they said.
This is what happens when high level execs care more about their compensation over they lively hood of the bottom tier workers that do important work. It is possible for companies to pay their employees well and still turn a profit. In n out is famous for paying their employees well over minimum wage and giving them health insurance and plenty of vacation days. Their burgers are still inexpensive and they turn a profit.
*cough* unions *cough*
i guess UNIONS WERE MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU THOUGHT HUH AMERICA? WE FOUGHT FOR UNION RIGHTS IN THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND THEN WE LET THEM TAKE IT AWAY... SAD SAD RETARDS... LOL.
OSHA had teeth when I worked in the Hospital setting in California. We live in a third world country for so many. It’s gross 🤮
Why I don't and won't ever again eat meat. Thanks, John. I recommend getting meat out of your diet as fast as you can. Most people who eat meat are eating suffering, antibiotics, and human slavery.  Sure you can buy meat from animals grown on local farm. But I assure you, once you stop eating your fellow creatures, you wil never want to ever again.
Despicable vacuous behavior and treatment of their workers by these industries. Thank you John Oliver.
Hmmm reminds me of a book I read once...a famous one by Upton SInclair...(which is easily the most depressing book I've ever read)
Tyson needs to go out of business
Tagesschau ist besser. Amerikanischer Humor ist mir zu unbeleidigend.
Watch Food Inc on YouTube. It came out over a decade ago and it seems like nothing has changed since then.
I hope you get a Peabody award for this.
Stop eating meat.
Typical Corporate america. People doing all the work get screwed while the paper pushers make all the money.
Even though I don't eat any meat whatsoever, I still feel part of this problem. Western society has truly lost its way
So what day are we staring out civil disobedience protest? I thought this was American
Thank you for bringing this up. With some luck more people will look into this. What a terrible situation.
Upton Sinclair is rolling in his grave over this.
Wow a john oliver show not devoted to donald trump, hired some.new writers maybe?
I'm so glad, I don't live in this shithole of a country.
John Oliver, you are a Marvel level hero for our time. You wield your comedic Sword of Justice with rapier precision, and like reverse Superman, your powers are fully expressed when you put ON the suit and glasses.
What ever happened to "Clean Meat" (laboratory grown meat)❓ We desperately need to get rid of slavery in this country. I'm not a vegetarian but I'm pretty damn close. People should NOT be eating this much meat❗
Wow they were betting on how many would catch the 🦠. That and ole boy pissing under the line, I see why my stepdaughter with vegan. Some information you want to know but don’t wanna know, this episode shocked the fuck out of me.
dont care, can this guy get deported please? who wants this guy around?
I got screwed over by workmens comp, unemployment and the doctors provided to me, they missed diagnosed and operated on me that was unneccessary... and they never fixed the original problem! The U.S. insurance companies are corrupt and need to be destroyed! I have no respect for these assholes!
6:26 "When we're dead and buried, our bones will still be hurting." That has to be one of the most chillingly morbid sentences I've ever heard in my life.
Hi John. You are a difficult person to contact. I offer on donation hypnosis to anyone and everyone to help people connect to their own subconscious and heal emotional and physical pain, especially during these crazy times. And I would really like to make contact with you. Please check my YT channel for contact details. ❤️

Boycott Tyson if you care
Atleast someone is talking about these workers , in China you would be died at the very moment you try to criticize the communist party
Missed the point by a mile- "You can draw one simple conclusion"  - STOP EATING MEAT! Our animals are abused, the people working in these factories are abused, until we find an alternative to factory farming and assembly line meatpacking, it is UNETHICAL to eat meat. As a humanist, and as a species that claims to love animals, we do a shitty job of showing it.

Any time a company you're interviewing for refers to their staff as being "like a family", do yourself a favor and RUN. Nothing good is gonna come out of this situation for you.
this is why i laugh when people tell me being vegan is extreme
I love it when someone tells me Unions and labor laws are no longer needed in this country.
Amazon was only charged $1,500 for violating covid rules. There are over 500 workers here.
If we really want to stop this from happening, we need to stop supporting these businesses. Buying from Tyson and the like is basically saying that you are OK with what they are doing. If you care about people or animals, stop buying meat. The problem is that Americans are unwilling to give up their comfort.

I feel ashamed that once I wanted to go to America. 😐
You think that's bad? Take the case of a worker who caught their hand in a meat reclamation machine losing it, and the manager had to be told that they needed to close the line down and clean it, when they refused it had to be pointed out that it is illegal to sell human meat for consumption. Otherwise they were just going to let it keep on rolling.
Not giving workers bathroom breaks is just asking for serious outbreaks such as Listeria Monocytogenes to occur. They should be closed down.
OMG this is really hard to hear.  Mr Sanchez never called in sick in 3 decades and they get finned 15000 for indirectly killing him... Just heartbreaking. Are they even allowed to unionize ?
Meatpacking?  You talking about the kids in cages at the border?  I can't believe people actually listen to the sound that comes out of your face
I used to work for a few poultry plant companies, they just change names, management, policy etc and keep the same facility. An average day we would kill between 150 to 250k chickens a day. Its a dirty labouring gruesome job depending on your department. Live hang which paid the most(15-18hr) is where you hang them by their feet into the shackles which can get up to like 150 birds per minute. Its pretty crazy and you need a damn strong back cause them birds aint going lol I always hated to see them suffer but I understood this is how we feed society. Its unfortunate cause a lot of the meat does go to waste, I stopped eating chicken for awhile.

In the richest country in human history .Modern slavery.
Is John Oliver a furry tho.
This is why a real free market is important.  Also John can make an entire piece on Cargill alone. Boy that company is awful.
While the working conditions there are bad, I find it really hard to see the workers as the victims while they're literally dismembering the corpses of sentient and intelligent beings that only died for our pleasure. The animal farming industry is one of the cruelest things happening in the world and I think it's a shame that it's so widely accepted in our society.
Related to meat packing workers are slaughterhouse workers who often end up with PTSD from their work and become desensitized to the suffering of others. Animals are not the only victims of the meat industry.
This kind of human abuse is why your grocery store rotisserie chicken cost $7. Savor that misery.
Undeveloped, third world oligarchy

What can we do, you ask? Join a union! The IWW can help. If there’s not a branch in your area, you can join the nearest one to you and they can help you organize your workplace and be able to fight back against the bosses. Our politicians, especially here in Texas (but, everywhere in the US, if we’re honest), are not going to help us.  The owning class, the 1%, whatever you wanna call them, are doing everything in their power to make us forget one thing. They’re only one percent of the population. We need to stand together in solidarity and fight back.

Wonder how many people will go vegetarian after this
You could just get angry about what a shit playce the world is or avoid buying from these companys...or do the unspeakable: reduce your meat consumption
Knew the title of the video and still didn’t know what the commercial with the guinea pig was for.
Shout out to my home Fort Worth TX  🤙🤘
Wait, wait, wait. I know the US is one of the last places to look for workers rights in a democracy, if not the last - but - in the US an employer can cheat you out of your compensation if you injure yourself?  What?
All this madness is funded by the customer.
Land of the greedy, home of the slaves.
Kinda off topic but this is why the EU does not want to import American chicken they feel these facilities that a dude just pissed in is not hygienic enough and that simply dropping the chicken into chlorine does not adequately clean the product.
Thats Murica for you...
John Oliver more American than most Americans
GO VEGAN 🥦🥬🌍🐄
Their argument is,  you can always quit.. last I checked theirs a shit load of other jobs out there
Hispanic and black needs to stop working in these job .

Sir make a video on Indian farmers protest please
Wow John Oliver. I am disappointed. You had the perfect opportunity to use the video of the Scottish mom yelling at her daughters and you missed it. Shame on you.
You didn't mention who won the pool!
Imagine Chinese poultry factories being more humane...

Do a segment on truckers how the country needs us but hates us.
The older I get and the more time I spend in the workforce, the less I'm surprised by all of this.
All those thumbs down...HUMMM
...... I wonder how much human material I've consumed through meat
Other than these conditions you speak of how about employees' health and work conditions! Retired fireman and dealt with hazardous materials my whole career and one of their so-called own in this state! I have 3 separate accidents in front of my family's organic farm! I called 911 for all three accidents! Was the one telling them proper protocol! This is Criminal intent to public safety! The USDA, EPA, DOT all notified as a well-selected official of this state, county, the city even my county health department! No action takes 17 months now! Every Federal, State, Couty City law has been broken on called the Emergency Response guidebook for hazardous material spills and containment here in the USA! To mention highway damaged at one million dollars per mile for this federally funded county improvement to highway safety! All left on the highway in state-owned ditches as well neighbors 500-acre cattle ranch! Ruined my family's organic farm sure many in the county! Mainly beef cattle production farms, chicken, turkey factory farms in the region! Now 17 months all ear drink graze daily hazardous materials active spills remnants! Unknown material, unknown quantities, unknown distance traveled for all three accidents! No proper accident investigations do as called sweep under the rug slang incident! All because of money and politics! Now hundreds of people involved with Criminal Intent to Public Safety! Still not recovered here in my state of Missouri, USA! All companies listed in the Midwest as food production of everything including USDA agriculture produced here ion the midwest! Unfortunately, it will take someone to die to get the FBI or US Marshalls involved as contacted them from the beginning of this first accident! Innocent school children daily get on and off a bus here as kids dio play in water puddles! I notified local hospitals even the coroners of surrounding counties of toxic chemical poisoning or death! Told all contact FBI if someone does of this due to called HIPA laws I will never hear these facts! So check me out here and see the real deal of why people do of cancer or have a disease! This is why elected officials of this county, city, state elected officials thinking they have no accountability! Pandemic is the least of your're worry`s people as we are all doomed way before this happened! Waterways runoff drains, rivers, oceans well water, hayfields, evaporation of rain, snow, ice onto the next farm, state nationwide or global by now! All wildlife affected as federal laws broken too! I just had weather events since groundhog day now everything imaginable with feet of snow ice, severe weather, thunderstorms, tornados warning, straight-line winds, hail, sleet, ice storms, winter weather advisors! Even life-threatening weather as winter weather records broken regionally! Sunny & warmer past two days finally! Now everything runs 360 degrees off-farm as on the highest bluff here in my county! Be millions of dollars for a civil lawsuit as reached out to many attorneys over the years now! Any pro-bono attorneys or attorneys obtained for cancer patients' deaths and interested contact me off my page! Be safe!
You forgot jenson meat company in San Diego. They busted out asses on a fast line n you literally had people dropping sweat on the patties 🤢🤮. Never buying patties at walmart that's for sure
Eating meat is just not worth all the suffering and environmental damage involved. There are some great alternatives and more are developed constantly. Try them sometime.
This is all I needed to officially become a vegetarian, not so much for the animal welfare as for the welfare of fellow humans and their rights to work and live safely and in dignity. Thank you John.
Just for the record, I'd swipe right on Johnny John Oliver.
We live in the New Guilded Age. Poultry workers and immigrants were subjected to these conditions until unions and when The Jungle was published.  I guess we are back to that
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Dystopic working conditions, but hard to stop them. I guess the only way to do something about it is adjusted customer behavior. If you can afford it, buy meat from sustainable farms or cut the consumption down. The 1$ steak comes at at the price of these people's health and wellbeing.
About time someone gave humans more shrift than the food. Get fucked those who think animals have it worse
Basically anyone who purchases meat also ends up being partially culpable here
Huggies are the new internet . IM DISGUSTING....
I've read Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle," I see where this is going...

Meat is overhyped anywho.
Start selling cheap guns at the entrance to jbs!!!!!!!!!!!! They won't stop till we die and they live off the blood and tears of our families and friends.  I'm facing termination over not going back to work but I a primary caregiver for my only living parent which is 73 elwith dementia and limited mobility and my daughter who I had to send to her mother's because we are afraid she would bring it home from school. I have no savings left and we live off of scarps but I refuse to sacrifice my familys wellbeing or our safety for someone else's pocket change..
What can we do? How about harsh prison sentences, hard labour and capital punishment for leading managers and company owners?
Smh thanks Biden
Government fines are a laugh across pretty much every industry. Literally every single government fine they give to businesses are smaller than the risk of whatever they are getting fined for.
I thought this was "Hello, I'm John Oliver, The Fudge Packer".

The big exceptional country without any unions and any regulations. But your country only care for the rich and mighty. Every regulation is called 'socialism' so you can go to the shop and buy garbage groceries produced by garbage companies.
Please put some audience laughter in
Poultry industry is full of🐔💩🤮🤮🤮! Thanks John & Co.
The complex mary logically attract because moat coincidently joke opposite a quiet poultry. lucky, warlike cupboard
We clearly need more libertarianism       /s
The inconsequential John Oliver.
how convenient to mention the immigrants in passing without adressing how modern slavery is precisely the business of putting people in a position of cooperation with capital or being handed over to the cops, which isnt much of a choice at all. mayhaps adressing the vulnerability of such a group would help the resources being exploited unfairly by corporations. just a thought.
Thats one way to open up
Kroger killed the Meat Packers Union years ago.
Wow and he didn’t even mention the poultry workers in GA getting frozen to death with Nitrogen in January
11 years I haven't eaten a piece of meat and will never again. No one has to eat meat to live, less alone to survive. I am far from alone, some have been vegan since birth. If you eat well and do it right you are the healthiest person you can be. Don't forget cigarettes were offered in hospitals and Doctors prescribed them etc, back in the day! Think about it! It's all $$$$$$$$. No one needs meat to live. As Paul McCartney wisely said "if slaughterhouses had glass walls, everyone would be vegetarian".
Remember pink slime ? When ABC reported this story the meat industry sued ABC into silence . Fast food companies swore off " fillers " ( lean finely textured beef - LFTB - pink slime ) until Feb 21 2017 when the GOP forced the USDA to declare that LFTB is 100 % beef ; safe for consumption & exempt from food labeling laws . Since then fast food companies & grocers no longer have to tell you what's in your hamburger . Fast food companies can lawfully tell you there's no filler , regardless . There used to be an old saying " Anyone can sell a sh*t sandwich but the jig is up after the 1st bite . " Apparently , not anymore . Most people don't care . I kind of think that had the movie " Soylent Green " been released today that after Charlton Heston yelled " It's people ! " the response would've been " So what ... "
Huh
"Make America great again." Every sane person: When was America great, again?
Wonder how this show is trending? Hes he's swearing and it isn't music?
@14:08 165 years! That's the time it takes for Neptune, the most distant planet, to orbit the sun.
Fun fact: the head of the US Department of Agriculture who loosened federal regulation of meatpacking, allowed poultry plants to self-inspect, and oversaw corporate consolidation in this sector was appointed back to that position by Biden and was just confirmed by the Senate.
Well Said!
Once he started talking about line speeds, and how workers are kept from ever leaving their positions, all I could think of was the Thomas Ligotti story, “Our Temporary Supervisor.” Don’t dare go question the odd shape behind the frosted glass. Best to keep your head down, and mimic the work of the mysterious new employee who can produce at lightning speed, even one handed while eating.
Great Info Bad Pottymouth
The steel mills of this country treat all their indentured servants the same way.
Please!Check my song.  👍👍
White collar crime does far more economic damage, and even kills more people, every year than street crime.  And this sort of thing is how it manages that death toll.  But, for some reason, Americans just don't care about white collar crime.  It is rarely, and only ever lightly, punished in comparison to street crime.  Snatch a purse?  Go to prison.  Save 80 cents by not installing some guard rails and end up amputating the arms of 9 meatpacking workers?  Eh, maybe the company will get some minor fine.  The American upper class are almost universally criminals thanks to white collar crime and its widespread tolerance by the American public.
I can hear the soundtrack to Team America as I'm watching this.
Meat packing has been horrific for at least the last 40 or more years.  The first horrific almost necessitating  worker safety. i.e. OSHA
How about saying phuck once in a while.
WTF Texas fight for your rights instead of just bending over
In Finland it wud take only one phonecall to stop this kaind of actions!!😱 We have wery effectiv safety on our workers and its in your contract that you can see the workdoctor when ever you need to see him and usually it takes 0-1 days to get there! It dibents how sirious it is! Be safe usa!🇫🇮❤️✌️
The chivalrous cheek maternally guarantee because scarf modestly exist apropos a steep sister. waiting, clumsy building
That loose definition of a family member checks out for many modern Americans. I'm surprised getting hurt on the job doesn't get you sent straight to the state run nursing home!
And the consumer costs will continue  to rise despite these companies implementing THE BARE MINIMUM for both employee and product safety.  Watch the chicken industry documentary from Morgan Spurlock, of Super Size Me, then be prepared to DESPISE BOTH THE INDUSTRY, THE PROCESSOR AND THE GOVERNMENT "OVERSIGHT" AND "PROTECTION" AGENCIES.
Everyone bitching about the state of the meat-packing industry: Are you still supporting it by buying meat from a grocery store?   Either stop eating meat entirely, or find a local farmer/butcher.
They might want to read The Jungle by Upton Sinclair
Okkkkkkkk
Great video.
Isn't it weird how essentially all of these problems would be resolved if factory workers had basically *any* amount of control over company decision-making? Everyone should be joining a union and joining their local DSA to prevent workplace exploitation like this. Make your voice heard in your workplace. Deregulation is happening to every industry- unionizing is more important now than it ever has been.
Capitalism is trashhhhhhh
In the mid 1990s a good semi automated chicken  processing line can max out at 120 birds per minute.  Consumer organizations have lobbied to block relief for standards from the USDA act from the 1930s....  e.g. each and every chicken has to be inspected after evisceration to include a visual and sniff test but no legal requirement to test for bacteria.  Bacteriological testing is done as a contractual requirement by the plant's liability insurance but no by law.
My mom lost a finger and broke both thumbs from working in a Tyson plant. And that's just the FIRST serious injury due to (imo) criminally horrible OSHA violations she's had in the 20+ years she's worked there.
Maybe we could just not eat so much cheapass meat.
Give up meat. I know it sounds crazy but you will feel 1000x better in a month. So light, fresh, and clear headed.❤️
We should all consider how our American diet is contributing to these things.  The switch to these corporate farms was necessitated by the growing demand for meat.  The population is growing, but so is our appetite.  There's no excuse for these abuses, but rather than sitting back and shaking our heads, we can make some changes.  If we ALL bought and ate a little less meat, the demand would go down, and maybe these plants could slow down.  Just a suggestion.
geez, why is everyone fat?
Zimmerman is a symptom of America.
The worst part is the only solution to this is automation leaving these people unemployed. They’re in between a rock and a hard place through no fault of their own.
funny we can critique this art but not your buddies.
and that train coming north will just make it worse.
*clears throat in Karl Marx*
I worked at McDonald’s and kinda made a bet on who would get it, turns out Nobody got it

Murica! Fuck yeah!
America is a failed state. We’ve stripped our government of the ability to actually take care of its citizens.
Almost like working in Amazon. Hell is becoming like this everywhere bigger facilities more likely to be like this!
Maybe people should, ya know, stop buying Tyson products. Just a thought.
These hard working people are who are demonized at the border. They endure what many can't. What would you endure for your family?
Companies don't say that Opting-out of Workers' Comp is optional. When I moved from California to Texas I was told that I had to sign it.
I worked at a chicken processing plant over a decade ago.  Its EXACTLY as described by John Oliver.  In fact, its probably worse.
A $10,000 check is not a blank check.
Normal Day in the greatest country on earth! Fuck yeah
This is why unions are important people🤬
7:17 - the immersion blender joke might be the most awkward joke in this episode lol
Okay, I very rarely eat beef or pork. Now I need to cut out chicken, and I am sure there is probably some reason I should not eat seafood. Plus, am I putting people out of work by cutting out chicken? Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!
..a blank $10,000 check. That doesn't make any sense.
Important topic BUT not a single word about workers union. Of course not, because it would be socialism and that the business daddies don't like. Too bad John Oliver is their puppet that is denied to dance to his own tune. Just looking problems on the surface here. It is better than nothing of course. It would shake the people in power if problems were really traced to the core and shown in shows like this.
OSHA should hire the employees who get violated on the daily.
I worked in the HR Team for a meatpacking organization acquired by JBS.  While at the facility, I routinely and internally reported a health and safety state mandate not being adhered to by the facility.  After communicating the issue several times, the plant manager and many within the organization came after me, shaming me for voicing the violation upwards and they essentially told me to silence my voice or choose a different organization to work for. I called them out for infringing on my constitutionally protected rights and subsequently protected rights under state law.  After this incident, I left the company.
I'm getting closer and closer to being vegan I swear. I already swore off pork after seeing a documentary,  now I just cant support poultry factories. They should be boycotted and then unionized if opened again. All I got left is beef, ....sigh
Who dat?
"The Jungle"- Upton Sinclair
“The Jungle” ~ Upton Sinclair, 1906
Go vegan
This whole industry is disgusting on so many levels!! Stop killing innocent animals!!!
Everyone should stop buying meat for a month (preferably a year) and help support better working conditions for those workers. Reading Slaughterhouse is a good start to begin with.
Yes John Oliver, the purveyor of intelligent information. BWAHAHAAHAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! What a slimeball!
Never forget that Trump signed an exec order increasing the speed on meat packing plant line speeds.
Wow. An episode that's not about trump. Ahhh the good ol days.
BOYCOTTS WORK! Engage in them if you give shit about workers.
If you think this kind of deregulation in favor of giant corporations is bad, check out what the Red States' GOP legislatures are doing to voting rights right now.
The USDA and OSHA must be given back the resources, personnel, and teeth and claws they need to keep these companies in check.
Thank you for an interesting and disgusting look at meatpacking. The workers are truly "animals" to the industry, easily replaced with someone else.       However, you are missing the most important issue here. The corporations are providing a service that consumers are demanding more and more, dead animals to eat. While corporate methods are linear and profit-oriented, they are just following capitalistic values. Where is the outcry from consumers who participate in this industry by buying their products?. Consumer demand fuels the industry and help cause the increase in line speeds and worker injuries. Consumers have the choice to STOP EATING AND KILLING THE ANIMALS THESE COMPANIES EXPLOIT, instead of criticizing the companies and putting all of the blame on them. Switching to a 'natural' animal to eat does not solve the problem, the smaller farmers are getting larger and are raising animals on miniature factory farms, on grass, and their animals are trucked to slaughterhouses as well. Go vegan, to start to save 9 billion chickens a year that will not be killed in the U.S. every year. Watch "earthlings" to see things from the animals perspective. peace.
This has been attitude towards line workers in the USA for CENTURIES. Don't kid yourself: CEOs and COOs don't give a furry crack what happens to the workers. All that matters to them is the stock price and their own golden parachutes.
I'm done being surprised by conditions in your country. You could have the managers dressed in slave owner clothing from the 1800s and the workers working naked, and i would be like "ok this is normal"
I'll be honest, that sounds exactly like my family.
I have no problem eating animals, but I quit meat because it's like cocaine. Its amazing, isn't healthy to consume too often, and people suffer incredibly in it's production, distribution, not to mention the environmental destruction. Don't buy cocaine, and whittle down meat eating to a minimum. It's really not very difficult. *sniffsniff*
Won't buy Tyson chicken, always getting recalled . Now that I know this I will tell everyone one I know even more reasons to not buy their products
Welp, no more Tyson products for me.
The ruthless tablecloth universally kick because pull ganguly glue despite a angry organization. wide-eyed, old-fashioned bead
The US needs new labour laws asap
I realize the need to feed the masses and most people can only afford the costs associated with this farming practice. Many Americans have the power to stop the exploitation of marginalized people in this country. Those who can afford to pay more for meat and products that treat their employees like humans should, and boycott these conglomerates of atrocity, forget about the subject of humanely raised and processed animals. That's another story. People should not be tortured so we can pay 89 cents a pound for crappy chicken and pork.
I'm not a meat packing worker but I work I'm a factory it's the same way we have a mask wearing rule that's pretty well followed but there have also been quite a few people who have gotten sick myself included and they basically did nothing I was only able to get paid for the week I missed because of the government program for covid-19 it's not right not to mention they pay us the bare minimum and work us to death and there is not set time for when your shifts going to start manufacturing in america as a whole is bad for the people involved
That guinea pig reminds me exactly of my pet squirrel during her mating cycle, every mid-May to early June, a fact that is actually relevant to John Oliver's episode before this lol
I could give a goddamn about any person working in this brutal, horrific industry. Animals being brutalized so people can fill their fat stomachs.
Anyone who builds large statues of themselves should be sent to the slave colonies Elon Musk wants to build on Mars.
Just thinking about how unhygienic we were pre-Covid. I think we live much safer lives the way we currently are. Staying at home, wearing at least 2 masks, saving lives. It is important that we keep up this way of life for the future, it’s the only way to keep everyone safe
As an ex Perdue farms plant employee, I can vouch for bullshit treatment behind the scenes. Animals and people
Money does not die when it is valued more than food. It isn't a question of if enough people die then companies will change their ways. Too much power, too much "your family" means doublespeak. "Your family" really means "your dead meat."
My parents live right by that Pilgrims Bride Bust/statue and I've been driving by that sucker for like 10 years
Corporate industries don't care about their entry level employees. If they call them "family", you KNOW that all employees are just a number and percentage to corporate.
I'm speechless
Its not just their industry.
Remember that they exist only because of demand-if you decrease demand for meat then you decrease the corporations profits
Lobbyists aren't the problem. It is spineless politicians that are bought. Vote in better people
osha is a fucking joke.
Literally eating a steak as I watch this. Will be back to tell you guys how it ends....
Pay no attention to how China handles their food in wet markets. It's all America's fault!
Are they teammates assets or family? Cuz if their family it's just business, if your team members then they should be free agents and be able to be able to negotiate their salaries and their contracts and if they're assets then they're not human
This is unregulated American capitalism. Awfully sick.
Man, this guy didn't get any better looking!
I can’t tell which is worse... working at an Amazon wear house or a meat packing plant
sick sad world, none of this is surprising and should change under this new administration. hoping Biden's pick to oversee all of this mess will do something to help those employed by these factories.
Remember, eating the rich Capitalists is vegan
It's almost like capitalism has outlived it's usefulness and we need to move on to something more human focused and less profit focused 🤔
The problem is Capitalism, and if you can't see that by this point I don't know what to fucking tell you.
Upton Sinclair wrote on this over a century ago, it's a shame little has changed since then.
Wow, it's almost as if capitalism is bad.
A hundred years later and it's like the jungle was never written
Or you could just call for the demise of this horrid, human-rights-abusing, inhumane to the max industry that's also destroying the planet. You vegan yet, John Oliver?
Pfff I read the Jungle I already knew the horrors of meat
no comment on GME? :(
I came to hear him complain about Trump but this is just meat.
Damn don't these workers have unions at all???
"Id love to be treated like an immersion blender. You want me to stay in a comfy drawer for most of the day and then occasionally come out to robot fuck a soup? Yes, please!" LOL
I use to work at a chicken plant. I knew a women who worked with me. She slipped and nearly broke her back. She hit her head hard and she went to the nurse report the injury. And I am not joking they gave a soda and a mint candy. They even told her to have 15 min break then head back to the plant to work.

Hmm?!  Hey, John?  ...rethinking your move from Great Britain to 'shit-show', USA?  Can it really be worse in The U.K. than here in The U.S.A?  I have my doubts, John.
We will probably be eating synthetic food before long? That's what Bill Gates thinks our meat should be!
Horrific conditions for humans and animals... go vegan. At least vegetarian
These jokes are so bad, even a fake live studio audience wouldn't laugh
Man... so much fucked up behavior.  Some people are so worried about government overreach but these corporations are running people’s lives
Cool to see now!       Great video now!    Poor Tormented Animals now—The Family got the Help they needed now!   Keep up the good work now!     Be well now!
It's amazing how many horrific and yet seemingly unrelated things go on in this country... what could the unifying theme be? 🤔
The only answer to this exploitation is STRONG UNIONS, yet John doesn't even mention them.
Regardless of anything, We'd all be better off eating less meat in the US
This comment section is Retarded
That Tyson yoga class eerily reminded me of the movie Snowpiercer
I think I’m going to become vegetarian.
Everybody is soo fat in america it's insane... Use your legs people!
When a company says, "we're a family," they mean  *you follow what your abusive authority figure says or else.* If you've had an abusive parent, you know.
This is where unions come in.  True in that unions can and have ruined worker production quality and other bad things, but it's better than what they are facing now.  The government needs to step in as well.  Remember that former president who signed bills to LOWER SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS?  Yep.  That didn't help.
I like your show but this isn't entirely factual. Line speeds are for inspectors not processing- that you listed. I work for the industry and can't speak about some you listed and most do social distancing. Perhaps Last March or April when it was new they weren't. Terrible practices in one industry doesn't mean all of them you listed do that. . Also one thing worth noting is many immigrants live in multi-family households and with something like COVID19 if one person catches it another 6-15 people living there catch it.
I hope this at least makes people curious about plant-based diets... hit these people in their pockets.

If you think that is bad you should check out casinos. We have to sign waivers that we will not talk about who gets infected and that if we get it we cannot sue the company for poor care for COVID and if we don’t sign those we are terminated immediately. Not to mention 0 enforcement on patrons for wearing masks or simple hygiene but enforcing strict rules against us because they don’t want damage to the company property (me. I’m property)
Rip the ACL of your knee in a fall on the job for Dollar General and they won't let you see a doctor, drag you out for 9 months with no treatment for the knee at all, threatening you that if you go to your own doctor they'll not only fire you they'll also sue you and refuse to pay any medical bills. THEN when you get the MRI you needed 9 months earlier and have been limping on a ripped up knee for 9 months and the MRI comes back showing the damage? Their doctors say "It's a chronic condition now...we are only responsible for acute injuries." and they cut you a check for 2K and tell you you can't seek legal action or any recompense against them or they'll sue you and I quote "Our lawyers are a lot better than any you could afford so I suggest you just take the money and learn to limp efficiently." oh...and then they put you on their "Do Not Hire" black list and let you go for "abandonment of your position"
I see going after the meat industry is the mainstream media’s new pet peeve.   Why not let people choose what they want to eat?
Imma b honest, ever since this episode, I'm pretty much done with pork. I've  been queezy about it since I read an article about the behaviors of pigs.  I was astounded to find out they  have the intelligence of a dog, and can be loving like one, just 😮, i felt guilty about eating them.  Now, now it's just time to stop.  Full stop on the pork, absolutely no more for me.
"They target poor people with job opportunities reeeee"
Keep supporting Hollywood pedos
No respect for human rights! Don't want to imagine how horrible it must be  for the animals. We need to Reform the meat industry!
John Oliver mentions people being cut, but where the blood of the cut goes? In my young time (25 y from now?) I get a summer job in a food processing company (outside USA). I cut myself several time and since no time was allowed to get new gloves, some of the food processed that day was "seasoned" with my own blood :D. I hope the people who bought it cooked it well...
Why the more i look into America, it less heaven and more like hell???
The Meat Packing Industry in the USA has always been horrible. Go read The Jungle by Upton Sinclair.
YIKES!!  America sucks!  Trump would LOVE this crap.  Sigh.
Yeah, but with these waivers obviously meant to hold a person's job and therefore income as hostage for victims to sign it wouldn't that be arguable by a lawyer on the victims behalf that the victim signed under economic duress in the attempt to make the waiver null and void by a court of law?
Stop buying meat. It would eliminate worker abuse and the horrible conditions for animals. It’s not difficult. If you’re not capable of hunting/killing the animal yourself, you shouldn’t even be eating it, anyways.
00. Explain to me:  why the media is not telling the American  People to Email Office of Attorney General in there STATES AND OTHER STATES to request a TRANSPARENT AUDIT regarding 2020 Presidential Election  this is information the American People need to know?  Why?  EXPLAIN?
Anyone else wondering how many of those corporate officials could be processed by those production lines in an afternoon?
Jeez...if your CEO starts to refer to you and your co-workers as a "family", it's time to start hunting for a new job!
You think Stalin's lack of care for his people was bad? Try the meat packing companies, they'll teach you all about the fundamentals of basic human rights. Oh wait, they don't tell you about such unnecesary morals.
I disagree with his list---Dame Judy Dench is infinitely more important than food, water, and shelter.
Little has changed in 115 years: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle
And I thought my country (Bangladesh), tells best jokes about labour rights.
You missed the most vital piece of data in the whole report.  what were the managers votes?  did they vote 5%, 10%, 50%, 100% ?  we need our data to form an opinion.
And vegans are extreme...
I don't know if there's a way to suggest topics they could cover but I'd really love him to do a piece on insurance or homeowner's insurance to be exact. I'm from Louisiana and we got hit by multiple hurricanes this past year and most of my town including myself isn't even close to recovering due to insurance companies delaying claims or dropping us all together and no one seems to help or care. It's insane!!
I'm working in the meat industry. Nothing will change unless people demand it.  Thank you for shedding some light on the conditions we work in.  There are studies that show that mental illness is 3 times higher in this industrie than other workspaces.
Workers truly have no value in this society. And their only purpose is to make corporations and shareholders rich. I seriously can't believe there hasn't been a revolution yet considering these sweatshop conditions.
This show used to be funny
0:22 "There it is!" "Behind the guinea pig?" "It is the guinea pig!"
It's darkly hilarious how large portions of our fellow Americans can complain about "big government" and "overbearing regulation" when entire, fundamental departments of the government are muzzled and underfunded like this.
Try how workers in any processing plant are treated. By in large majority only give a shit when the public eye is on them and only to be brutally honest, if the workers are not immigrants-legal or otherwise. I am white and born in the US, and I can personally attest to the fact that if it weren't for immigrants- both legal and illegal- our national food supply chain would screech to a halt. From past experience, I witnessed the work that the majority of the people perform is long arduous work that they get paid the absolute lowest wage possible usually. Even when a state steps in to mandate a higher minimum wage, what you get is the cost of living going up sometimes a good month ahead of the wage increase. You can't force a company to pay a liveable wage and decrease their profit margin so they don't have to raise their cost to consumers. But how do you draw the line between how much a person -who is now labeled "an essential worker"- gets paid versus a person in the administrative side of a company? I do believe those jobs that require a college degree or any education/ specialized training from trade school should pay more at the same time, essential workers that keep the food supply going need to be paid more than the teen working at the local fast food place. Fast food isn't essential despite what many might think. People won't die if they can't buy prepared food that is devoid of nutritional content lol!  There are exceptions to these conditions out there. But in order to make this change, society will have to make a change in the way we treat our fellow human beings and stop taking everything for granted.  I don't think that will happen until it is forced to as a means of the only way to survive.
dude is looking fat and old. damn
I've been in those plants as an engineer that worked on equipment used by them. Definitely not a fun job and very high turnover rates in most plants. Sadly not a lot of other jobs in the towns most plants are in and the folks there don't have a lot of training for other stuff.
This is absolutely why we need stronger unions. Yeah, there are problems that arise from them, but companies will inevitably abuse their workforce if there isn't anyone standing up for them.
This is just the sort of thing Eric Schlosser talks about in Fast Food Nation. READ IT,
Judi Dench is indeed a fucking treasure!
Lol. I'm vegetarian, so lol it doesn't apply.
That's why you get meat from the source.
U N I O N I S E  Unions only exist for the purpose of employees' interests, only they will stand at your side in matter like these.  Make sure they have an unemployment insurance scheme so they can't play the waiting game with you
But there's just no way that this is somehow related to capitalism... right? guys?
"She's a difficult woman, Billy"

PETA and vegans showing videos of animals being killed and the inhumane living conditions of them before the slaughter....... Feels nothing. John Oliver "Hey look how disgusting this meat packing line is" Not only disgusting enough to turn me off of meat but veggies too anything out of any plant
I really miss John Oliver slamming his hands on a table :(
I have already stopped eating chicken, beef and pork. A bit of fish or perhaps some lamb occasionally. This report strengthens my resolve. Truly disgusting.
The founder of the company which JBS now owns was Mr. Montfort.  A righteous stand up man who Never would have tolerated such injustices.  I know, I ran the laboratory for the Montfort family back in the early ‘70’s.  He would be horrified were he or his son Ken alive today.
If people would not sell/kill/eat animals, we would not have Covid right now and would not support this killer industry that is just as disgusting as their procedures and products. If you like to eat unknown mixes of antibiotics, hormones and all sorts of chemicals that come with maximizing revenue, ruining the CO2 footprint, you should just continue this horrible tradition and accelerate the extinction of our species, so in the long run the planet can regenerate itself, which will go much faster without us.
What are you moving on from, John?

It was great that for year or 2, all we get is TRUMP is bad, TRUMP is Orange. Now, that no-show Joe didnt even bother attend any debate is president. Normalcy continues, you are major sell-out or post TRUMP syndrome drone, nope, not a TRUMP fan, but when he seems normal, you all look foolish.
A Plant Manager that's an asshole? I just can't believe it.
Yay, Capitalism, amiright? 😅
Dont take John Oliver seriously.. he is an islam apologist.. and wants you to buy HALALA meat.. or Maybe he is an islamist
It is clearly that this is another Stat to have on mind. if we want to fight both  greed, and human hunger.
wishful thinking... In American Money Talks SH!@s WALKS........... TAKE A WALK
Oh cmon John Roseanne got screwed so don’t join the bs bandwagon
This story is everywhere. By that I mean so many companies not just chicken companies do exactly this. temp agencies do the same for instance you get hurt go to dr and you are fired. Amazon is another and it just goes on and on. Basically anywhere that makes a lot of money usually guaranteed to have same practice with companies that pressure more work than is reasonable, pay minimum wage or an amount that doesn't reflect hazards or amount of work, and demonstrates how expendable the worker is  to them. While saying they are valued and where their treatment is clearly not in line with the propaganda they spew. And lets not forget the suppression of systems in place to combat the injustices through schemes and payoffs. chicken, beef, coal, propane, mining, etc. push to reduce oversight or cripple in place agencies that would hurt their profits.
so glad this season's looking better than the last one!
When he said “a mammal higher than me on the food chain” I was sure he was going to mention Adam Driver.
The show title now has black mode!!
This just shows one more time how the united states are really a third world country...
I worked at cargill for 5 1/2 years. This is all accurate. Right down to the specifics of carpal tunnel syndrome (nearly everyone on the line has it or is developing it), the fact that they prop these places up in areas with no good alternatives for work (look up Cargill Wyalusing), hiring felons that can’t get other jobs (absolutely known for it) and illegals (there was a big deal of them getting busted), and the Covid pandemic related issues. This is spot on. No exaggeration.
American ads are insane
And this doesn't even mention how some plants use literal slave labor under the guise of being a "rehabilitation center" for "drug addicts". See https://revealnews.org/article/they-thought-they-were-going-to-rehab-they-ended-up-in-chicken-plants/
Well this is disgusting 😞
Tyson sends busses to Mexico to pick up immigrants, then when they start to earn double digits calls the INS to take them back while a new bus load heads north. PLEASE BOYCOTT ALL THE MEAT PRODUCERS  & BUY LOCALLY.  JBS is out of Brazil.  They lied when they said that they needed to be considered "ESSENTIAL" and that merka would run out of meat. The pork had been sold to China because they had to cull millions of pigs due to the swine flu. Look it up.
The more companies try to say the employees are family, the more I know how bad the working conditions are
Apparently a lot of unintentional cannibalism is going on in the US. Who cares!? It's all about the herbs and the BBQ sauce.
The animal industry is bad in ALL levels, for animals, for workers, for our environment, for our health.
6:03 nothing but facts
100% true on Tyson. I interviewed there 2 years ago. 6 days a week minimum work week, 10 hour shifts, in house nurse's (telltale sign workmans comp cases are dealt with in house), and the workers on the floor looked miserable.
Change will NEVER happen as long as the Rich control our government. And that's not going to change without campaign reform & term limits and limit on corporate lobbing efforts.
Why are we still eating meat?
3:00... Ok and what's the issue?
Vegetarians must be feeling good right about now
This is a 3rd world country disguised as a first world country
America is such a third world country...
Just don’t eat meat you idiots.
Companies don’t care about workers never had and never will, they don’t look at them as human. Companies will never change because we are conformist, we never put conditions or let companies suffer from consequences because we still buy their products and just move on. I’m not saying I’m perfect doing something, my point is we need to change things in work environments and plenty of other stuff. We still human after all.
It's estimated that if you took all the organs from a person (I mean everything including skin and bones) and sold them on the black market, you'd make $1,000,000. If it is shown that a companies negligence has resulted in deaths, they should pay $1,000,000 in fines per dead person.
so sad let's change this. vote Democratic 🗳 for change . This must stop, ✋ not 🚱 in America.
And the circle is complete Upton Sinclair to Johnny ‘O back to the Jungle
Or, you could stop eating meat. Should've suggested that John.
that guinea pig commercial kept me from hitting my bowl for a full 3 minutes....lmfao
NO compassion fo any life!!
Best line in this episode: "... don't be surprised when they carry on  not giving *A FRACTION OF A FVCK* about the welfare of their workers!"
Thank god we have cool companies like Coke Cola...
don't ever buy meat if you don't know where it's butchered. Shop at your local meat market! It's not expensive, it costs what meat is supposed to cost.
Thank you for this, Mr. Oliver. The word "IOWA" needs to be repeated about a million times more-frequently, in-reference to ALL of the "gamed" constructs which support this industry. (This being written within weeks after the Governor of Iowa erased all mask mandates and social distancing regulations a day or so before The Super Bowl; and three days before The CDC proposed that 'double-masking' was a wise approach.) PLEASE do a piece on states where their governors refuse to work within known medical guidelines; we're dying out here.
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
OMG its horrible... I forgot the steaks at the store
That betting pool is heavy metal
I just laughed myself to tears when I saw that pic of John being carried off by the pigeon. I missed everything for a full min after...
You Americans need Unions ... yes they are a pain in the butt for the employer but they actually archive something for the worker
SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL FARMERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
American. Where we watch a British guy telling us how crappy our country is so long as we laugh in the process. Let's not forget America and the rest of the world is hugely better off today than 100 years ago.

The lack of OSHA protection does not enable your Boss to put his profits ahead of your life, it requires it.
I only buy my meat local, raised, and slaughtered by the man who’s hand I shake when I go to his farm to pick up my food. Support the American farmer not the Walmart your buying from.
Some of his points are absolutely on spot, like the one with setting up a safe speed and that's not only applies to the meatpacking industry, but also in other places such amazon warehouses and with the some universities as well.   Bottom line is "We aren't machine, so stop treating like one"
Anything to get us closer to eating synthetic meat or bugs right?
Bo Pilgrim sounds like that pig man from King of the Hill.
If I was working at a local, state, or federal level of government, I’d have about four years worth of issues to choose from to make even a small difference in my constituents lives. That though causes the this one: how are my local, state, and federal governmental officials determining what to work on?
Me currently eating a roast beef sandwich.
america is not a role model when it comes to workers rights and this is horrible even for this country but I have got to say this is a global problem... competing companies  selling their stuff on a global market my home country (germany) is mostly pretty good when it comes to working conditions... BUT being one of the biggest roducing country we get foreign workers in alike ways... the law gets some of those employers but there is a lot we don´t know... and the things we don´t know are always the worst... sure we need agreements on fair traiding but it´s even more important that in a shared market we need workers rights (Im sick of hearing that people aare not allowed to take a piss, getting denied sick leave or vacation days)... But this is a socialistic idea...And those who need those rights have no big lobby...
Did you really just use bloomberg news as a source? That guy tried to buy his way to the white house in the last election
When companies had a Personnel Dept. you were considered a person. Now that they have a Human Resources Dept. you are considered a resource.
wow, i really wonder sometimes if people like bo ever stop for a moment and realise for a second how evil they and hated they are and just keep moving, or their psychopathic personality just shield them completely from their actions?
but.... who won the pool?
Bloody Hell! I don't live in the US so I am shocked at some of the things they show on TV. Me, I'm happy with nice , calm John Oliver shows.
We have one in my town everybody calls it the chicken factory I was told not to work their it's all meth heads and their all holding knifes
I've been working in a meat department for about 8 years. It's insane to think about the meat industry. Like looking at how much meat we go through in a day, week, month or year. Everything about it is insane
AMERICA 🇺🇸 🤣
That $15,000 fine is the equivalent of fining a family who makes $100,000 a year all of 3¢ for an infraction. I mean, a toddler could come up with that kind of money by digging through couch cushions and have money left over! Average income in the US is half of that. So rounding up, that’s 2¢. Fines have to hurt to be effective.   #PerspectiveIsEverything
I always find it interesting how this topic can cause such a visceral reaction and yet the obvious solution of “just stop eating meat” is dismissed out of hand because...it tastes good so fuck everything else?
The government's response was for Trump to sign an executive order to keep the packing plants open during the pandemic. In 2019 he signed an order to reduce the number of inspectors in pork processing plants and to run the lines with no speed limits. Great guy, that Trump.
Meat packing is a highly consolidated industry  Wait which industry was not 😂😂😂 The Unemployed Industry is not consolidated !!!
the 3 women on the talkshow reacted pretty well to that!

The fact that an exploitative industry exploits people 😱
Amen!
I love cooking if not busy
Why are you guys focusing on to eat or not to eat meat? The problem is not the meat, the problem is the shitty working condition.
"Hi I'm Jim Purdue, and my chickens eat better than you do! For one thing, I don't let 'em eat chicken. And if one of my employees forgets to put my name on a single chicken leg, I chop that stupid bugger up and feed HIM to the chickens!"

This is sadly true, I've worked for Perdue, and my Family currently works for Perdue. An Perdue doesn't care about it's employees even during the pandemic they took minimal safety measures against covid if you want a test for it, it'll be 100 of your pay-checks and if you have covid then your ordered to be at home for 2 weeks which they don't pay. Not to mention the other things that happen.
Change your shows name to rolling out the great reset agenda...one episode at a time (meat is evil, climate change, pandemics, social injustice, etc.). Klaus is proud of you.
Poor people in poor areas, people without professional skills and ex inmates have trouble getting jobs -> look how at these bad companies that don't hire those vulnerable people ! The meatpacking industry provides these people with jobs --> they are taking advantage of these poor people !  This is just a dishonest argument. In my country we try to overprotect the "vulnerables" and guess what... 10% of people can't find a job at all
We should all stop eating meat during the pandemic - that would teach them! (I am not at vegetarian, but here in Germany many meat-processing plants have been affected, too).
john oliver is one of the dumbest people on the planet
Wow. This segment sounds like the usual description the U.S gives of China. The difference between China and the U.S China invest in their people and the U.S invest in its corporations.
Tyson is like my family
Yet another reason to boycott the meat, dairy and egg industry
Meat, dairy and egg industry is disgusting. So are the consumers who support it once the know the truth about the horrid conditions, cruelty and death.
God no wonder why Tyson tastes so fucking good. I can't eat a product unless it's produced by at minimum 50% slave labor. If I had a dollar for every one of you chucklefucks crying about how evil meatpacking is while using a microsoft device I'd probably have enough money to buy a meat plant and its staff on my own.
Wait... this isn't about the animals... this is about humans ?  don't care.  /sarcasm.
I'm a nurse  When the tyson employee a.d their loved ones started trending in the ERs and ICUs we started keeping an unofficial tally. We just knew 'Tyson Factory Worker's would become a COVID statistical subclass for contact tracing...guess it turns out the government opted to pretend like the TYSON Factory COVID-19  epidemiological trend never happened 🙄😒
All of these managers aught to get a visit from child protective services if that's how they treat family members
They only give a fraction of a fuck

And, this is just, what is.
Oof. 5000 dollars a life, thats how much were worth to companies, its fun.
The 1 %ers like it just like that.
I was a security guard at the largest hog plant in the world, Smithfield Hog Plant in Tar Heel N.C. I was assigned to the main entrance where I was told I couldn’t leave to use the bathroom and if I really had to go bad I had to call the parking lot guard OVER THE RADIO SO EVERYONE KNEW, wait for them to get there and they had to stand at my spot until I was done so that was embarrassing. I told the boss I couldn’t do it anymore and he moved me to 3rd shift parking lot security. I had to patrol the outside and parts of the inside because someone took a crap on the kill floor cooler floor! The kill floor was so hot that the man who was in charge with cutting the pigs heads off with a “jaws of life” type tool wasn’t wearing a shirt. The majority of the employees came from a country where they didn’t have indoor plumbing so they would hardly ever flush or wash their hands! They would defecate on top of the last employees waste and this would clog up the toilets when maintenance tried to flush it making the place smell horrible! Hell I even remember seeing some of the men from the kill floor bring the knives they used to cut their part of the hogs with and hand sharpener‘s outside with them on their breaks! Even though this was in the early 2000’s I can still vividly see them walk back in sharpening their knives and thinking, I’m 19/20 and I’m not even allowed pepper spray! smh Also my ex-boss tried to put me back at my original post so I quit! This is the same man that would constantly say the N word and talk crap about black people but ended up marrying an African American Woman. Wonder what she would think if she knew that!
Same with almost every single big company ever
This is why employees have to unionize and why companies pay to lobby so hard against unions
“We let the office employees stretch sometimes! We’re so great!” (I’d bet it’s not even on paid time)
Eat meat repeat the story of mankind
If you really cared about these workers, the planet and the animals, you would stop supporting these evil companies by ditching MEAT off your plate today. But nobody wants to do that.
15:55 - Ah yes, JBS. The company that became the world's largest meat processor with the help of corruption and the Brazilian government
Fucking sad, is this really what America has become? Here is a topic for you, John Ive worked for a major city fire department as a paramedic for years and you should see our treatment after injuries or lack there of.  None of us are ever "repaired", it's kinda like they will drag it out until unavoidable any longer,  then maybe take they might take  it seriously, oh and and if you get to see a doctor you see some of the shittiest quack doctors, if there is any surgery or less invasive treatments preformed, they are rushed and done half assed.

Interesting. And where exactly is the difference to China?
Is this how "the greatest country in the world and we're proud of it" treats its workers? What year are we in? Charles Dickens wrote about these conditions back in the 19 century!
Thank you for not saying become "vegan" when you get to the party about what we can do. Just bc u don't eat meat doesn't mean your of the hook somehow. And like you always say, Mr. Oliver, we need to do better. For everyone.
Just how much shittier is the USA than the rest of the western world? John Oliver seems to be making a career on these sort of stories, that would be unimaginable in western Europe.
Do I need to go vegan to protest the treatment of meat packing workers?
Hey vegans! Take note; *this* is how you argue for veganism.
nice to find him back to his roots instead of lib dem BS
One of the many reasons I don't eat meat

Go ahead John. Talk about the nightmares happening in the animal farming industry.
Burn it!
How do you screw up ranch flavor that badly?
Time to go vegan.
so why the fuck does anyone still eat meat?
A fact is a unit of data that is not in dispute or is indisputable in that it can be empirically verified objectively. 2:29 What you just asserted is not a fact. It's your own subjective opinion, which differs from almost everyone else's. C'mon John; you are better than that.
I wish these YouTube descriptions included show notes so I can do further research on what what's being said. Seems like the tl;dr here is buy from local farms and local butchers.
Should get ur old writers still good but cheaper jokes still love the show tho
Meat is one of the biggest cause of climate change, the animals are tortured and now this.... I don’t understand why people can’t just quit a luxury(of eating meat) for the benefit of the planet.
When is Brexit IV?
@LastWeekTonight - John: You should have sent your trolls to the meatfactories websites to maul them into behaving (since laws, 'order' and behaving humanely seems to be a longshot in this buiness)
Thank you for showing this! Everyone needs to know! Slave labour on top of it all! Why aren't people protesting in the streets? Everyone (almost) eats meat. This is not a theme for a comedy show. Where is the comedy, I see only tragedies!
they probably just have the opinion that the tests used show flu shots and not real sars , cuz it aint a real virus
If everything with a slightly leftist aspect is a communism atrocity that will make USA fall in the grasp of Stalin and ruin it forever...well this is the result: no laws for worker class but just against them. Cos you know, the market will fix the problem by itself 👍
Why does anyone want to work in the USA?
Who clicked and thought, "Here we go again, it's going to be about Agriprocessors"? What a surprise.
Best Country in the world indeed...
All true, used to work at a meat processing plant before.
So, just to be clear, if a "human machine" is eventually replaced by an "actual machine", would that still be an issue? I bet it would.
*And is why some people just hate everything and everyone.*
Why are OSHA staff levels so low? Child protective services are low, too. And I'm sure lots of other areas. What do we do about this?
Well Brexit voters...Behold the future of Britain's workers after deregulating those 'pesky ' E.U laws...Enjoy !
It's Stark?
They all have rabies now
Thank you John Oliver, for bringing this horrible situation into the light. I am one of the viewers that disliked this video ONLY because of the inhumane working standards of Tyson Chicken!!! As always, your coverage is impeccable!!!
This show used to be comedic but now it's just depressing. Not sure if it was due to the change in writing style or just because the country is just full of shit lol
EXACTLY! Care for our Corporate workers, F*CK The Production Workers
product of the gutting of labor unions.
Are they even allowed to unionize?
"We're a family."  Fine print: It's a dysfunctional family that treats the mom like the maid. you're the mom and we're the entitled children.

the difference between the US and other countries that have a lot of trouble amongst the citizens is that most countries cant take care of everyone, in the US, they choose not to
STOP EATING MEAT! SICKOS
Capitalism at it's purest. Only the money matters.
I made this for my son https://youtu.be/OdO9honz_Js
Did some of y'all really need John Oliver to come on here and tell you that your corpse dealers are also cruel and evil to their workers? That seems like a given to me, like what else would you even expect? I'm so glad I haven't contributed to any of this BS since 2007, what a time to be vegan.
57000 infected and 283 died... OMG... that means this horrible pandemic has a 0.496% death rate...
It continues to shock (but not surprise) me how little USAmericans seem to realise they're being fucked over in comparison to much of the rest of the world.
I read the classic novel, “The Jungle” in high school and immediately became a staunch vegetarian for the rest of my life. The fact that we continue to slaughter innocent animals unnecessarily when there are so many other options for protein sources is barbarism, full stop.
So this is the shit that makes U, US teenagers think that communism was anny better? Get it ... but really ... it wasnt. Read Animal Farm from Orwell - its pretty acurate. Post-communist European country resident speaking.
Eating meat is bad in so many ways...
Me, as European, Is so confused to see this. See how, slavery, is still alive in the USA, and people accept it? And buy the food? Why do you think Hudson Bay did not make it in Europe. It's a terror company which does not fit in the free Europe. Shame these companies and make sure they are shared on social media so everyone knows, whenever they see this brand to just avoid it. The costumer is the one with true power. In a world with alternatives.
John, So There is so much more to this story. You will find stuff exactly like this happening everywhere. FedEx, UPS,  A another Huge company I can not last here for legal reasons, oil and natural gas industry, mining, Construction, and ever Retail workers being exported in the exact same way.
This was on number 1 trending, and that’s the way it should be
Chicken comp. Suuuuuuure ssure. How about a Tyson rep? More nutritious.   (I condone none of this but the feeling is there)
Ahhhh John is BACK and it's never felt so good to hurt so bad!
If all the line workers UNIFIED did a sit down strike the attention it would attract would help change things for the better!
"meatpacking plant" would also be a great name for a) A gay club b) a flower with a lot of fiber
If you like John Oliver, you are a sad sack of 💩
I work at a grocery store chain as a meat cutter and when our asst meat manager was told to report to a store whose meat room has a confirmed case of covid the week before, she expressed concern as she lived with her 70 year old inlaws. Our manager told her "they're 70, they lived a good life."  0 doubts about any of this
Quit meat, save animals, save humans, save the planet. If you are against something, DONT pay for it!
Vegans: Stop eating animals it’s cruel to animals! Me: I sleep John Oliver: The people preparing those animals work in these terrible conditions! Let me tell you about it! Me: Real sh*t?!
It's surprising that you could change the title "meatpacking" to "shipping". You can change Tyson with Amazon and you can run the same segment the same way with little change. From potty breaks, racism in pay, death pools, only first aid, wavers, immigrants... it's mirrored issue.
The Outer Worlds is a documentary apparently
the state of Florida Workman's Cop and unemployment systems are effectively bankrupt thanks to lobbyists like the ones in the Meatpacking industry and horrible mismanagement by form Governor Rick Scott. workers being outright abused by their employers or their parent companies is as rapid and widespread a problem as covid. only no one's talking about it if you don't have news anchors anymore we have PR men
So ummm... Socialism is evil? Capitalism works fine and everyone works perfectly eh?
Sorry for being so late >__< I feel like I'm apologizing to everyone :(
The most important thing in that industry is no down time on the production line.
Remember that 90% of meat in the US is pet food grade. If veganism frightens you, then please consider scaling back on the meat and types of meat you consume.  I've eaten a small helping of meat no more than once a month for going on 25 years now and I've never had to visit a doctor, suffer no diet-based diseases, and remain healthy and, according to my IQ test at 42 years of age, smarter too!
I am always irritated and triggered when a boss mentions that the company is a family. would, he for example, babysit the kids of an employee in an emergency? Would he give any of those employees a ride home if need be? Families do that np
After looking at this nasty ass video I will not be buying me of any kind of meat to go in my stomach. 🤔👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
So why in the world do they work there?
Sounds like those workers should maybe be able to control the place and instruments that they use to produce things. Wish somebody else could've come up with that concept ages ago
I wouldn't take a job where I can't have bathroom breaks that's just ridiculous, when you got to go you got to go 😐 I'm grown and so I'm going to go to the bathroom when I choose to go and ain't no manager or anybody that's over company going to stop me from going to the bathroom 🤔👎👎👎
This show should be called "Symptoms of capitalism, the root of all these troubles that we will never mention directly"   This comments needs to be higher
I won't be buying no processed chicken or any chicken at all or meat, 🤔👎👎👎👎
You know what else could help the workers? Unions. It is time we stop demonizing unions and start allowing employees to get protection from a union. Big business certainly is not going to take care of their employees.

Osha came to our factory, complained about drop cords, but didnt say anything about the forklifts that didnt have working brakes.  You had to throw it into reverse to stop it.
Biden won’t do anything about this.
Yuck...good time to go vegan! lol
And to think some people still herald the Invisible Hand as the almighty saviour for humanity.
you suck, John Oliver
There is a magical thing called "unions" (uhh scary socialist stuff), I would advise you to get some.
Settling in to hear a condemnation of illegal immigration and importing low-skill workers.
We will not eat the bugs.
Any vegans watching this like "we told you so"
Theory: Capitalism enforces competition  Data: 85% of the market is controlled by 4 companies
USA is a SICK country. There is no end in sight either. Republicans and Democrats are the same...

Gee...same exact tactics as auto plants!

This is wrong on so many levels I don't even know where to start. And it is all of you Americans to blame for that, cause if all of you thought this situation is as unbearable and unjust as it actually is, it will already be changed.
Thanks for the great report. It's a shame that there is so much unlike for this video. It's the fact that there are so many people who don't care about the working-class which actually is running every country
Keep in mind that this country is all about capital. The meat and poultry companies simply hand the right person a few weekend resort vacation tickets and all is well. This type of Slavery has been going on for decades and do you think the osha or state and federal politicians are unaware. Not a chance, I would bet they are Lobbied (paid) to look the other way. I believe they call that PACT money or campaign contributions.
Why we need to rid our country of Citizens United! Citizens United is the Trojan Horse that helped weaken our federal agencies. We are looking more fascist as every year passes.
Very interesting and important story, but who the heck writes these jokes?
How do you have a blank check for $10,000? If the check is for $10,000, that seemingly rules out being blank, since the amount is clearly filled in. Meh, oh well. Just my pedantism surfacing.
Some people stay not washing their meat
Community Supported Agriculture (CSAs) help support local small farms and gets you fresh food (including meat if you choose). You can find one in your area: https://www.localharvest.org/locations/
This is why it's important to implement Regenerative Agriculture at a much larger scale. Check White Oak Pastures on YT - a ranch with a quarter of a million animals and a story of success by applying Regenerative Agriculture/Holistic Management Principles. The consolidation of the meat industry is a Weak Link in Every Country I know of, and Oliver here has just scratched the surface (very lightly, I might add). The more you know the more you realize the horror of what is going on.
Thanks John, now I'm depressed
Out of all the national chicken producers, Pilgrim's is the worst in quality.
The fact that america has so many people being mistreated and taken advantage of for money is depressing
Ive worked in Poultry plants for 6 years now and you really only scratched the surface on how bad it is for most of the workers and how little USDA and OSHA can do inside the plant. Ive seen coworkers have fingers ripped off by machines, feet crushed by pallet jacks, people faint on line and watch the supervisors restart the line before they radio medical for help, my first month a kid died because they wouldnt let him use his inhaler and he had an attack, a former supervisor had his skull crushed and died changing a battery for a pallet jack. Thats .... thats just injurys i can remember quickly. The USDA dose what they can but man the plant plays fast and loose with those USDA holds, if they could swap the product on hold with different "good" product while USDA was away or something they would w/o a hesitation. I could go on for hours. Id really support the idea of rebuilding the USDA and OSHA. If anyone read this far ill give you a small tip ive learned for buying chicken in the store, if you see a piece that is paler that the rest in a pack, dont buy the pack, it was probably dropped on the floor and rinsed off.

I remember my high school teachers telling me back when the meatpacking plant was still open in rural iowa, and unionized, before the packinghouse in storm lake opened and they used that as an excuse to close the plant - that you could drop out of high school and walk over and make $50,000+ a year in the 1970's the same day.  Things weren't great, and the work still took its toll on a lot of people who worked there - but it wasn't nearly as bad or as much of a sweatshop as it is today.  You go up to Worthington (or any other meatpacking town) and poke around a bit and man there are some saaaaaaaad stories
I hope that the US will one day be able to take a step towards becoming a developed country lol
Yeah sure, their working conditions are a bit hard, but it's a free country right? The rich is free to get richer by sucking dry the poor, and the poor is free to accept or live in the street.
THIS is how you influence consumer behaviour
First World Country...Lol
America is such a 3rd world country right now. Almost every other country in Europe has better healthcare, better safetynet (provided by the government) for people who lose their jobs and/or are unable to work and better work environment.
this video needs to reach as broad an audience as possible, so take my like and comment for the alg*rithm
This is why I stopped eating meat.
And then, of course, don't forget how they treat the animals!
Well, Go Vegan i guess 🌱
The journalist Upton Sinclair exposed a lot of this already: one hundred and fourteen years ago.
lol... Oliver is so beta he thinks he's not at the top of the food chain.
Are you planning to do an episode on the Qatar World Cup?
The average Packing House worker only last two-and-a-half years on the job that was back in the 80s I don't know I've seen people throwing in the back of a truck and take it to a clinic with a broken leg and not a hospital or call an ambulance. Housing company doctor has almost killed people in that took them to a clinic we had a company doctor that wasn't a doctor's he was a PA without a medical license it was suspended in two states the moral turpitude the UFCW new this doctor didn't have a medical license the union knew it and didn't tell the employees its members
Thank you for the great subtitles HBO
The bigger the crime the less the punishment
Both my hands are cripple for working with a knife for only 6 months
Well, those conditions are kinda normal nowadays in every line production. The problem is not just in management but in the workers themselves who allowed those crazy norms in the first place.  I worked at a production line and with my team leader I set the standard norm time to realistic times, everything was fine for a while. Over time I was switched to work somewhere else. Then later they switched me back to my old position AND THE TACT TIMES WERE COMPLETELY F****! For whatever stupid reason, those idiotic workers, new ones and old ones ruined those tact line times and were jumping around like crazies, sweating, working through break times, no bathroom, going to work and starting work long before actual shift etc. My guess, new workers didn't want to lose the job and so old workers also didn't want to lose the job either. And so they created this spiral of mess... and I was eventually fired for being too annoying about it lol. At least I'm free from the madness and have some savings.
MAN! I missed you!!! Lol 😂 😝 😂 😆
This is what unions are for to stop this type of abuse!
No packing house care about there employees
This whole meat industry is monstrous. Its killing us, the planet, the animals and the workers. Its the business of pain blood and death, literally.
Funny how Texas senators have changed over time. 30 years ago Hugh Palmer wouldn't take a bribe. Today we have Ted Cruz.
JBS tried to say "Australians don't want to work" due to there being actual welfare relief in Australia (doubled due to COVID19). Get directly into the bin!
I remember a couple of years ago watching a video where instead of paying their undocumented immigrants Tyson called INS on them so they wouldn't have to pay them. Haven't touched Tyson since then and never will.
How many Kris Jenner jokes do you think were pitched for the "your family is not an asset" bit?
They need to unionize
The fight continues!
When their business is founded on the violent exploitation and slaughter of sentient creatures, it’s not surprising that they treat their workers poorly.  This is yet another reason that we need to stop buying animal products.
Ugh the US is such trash 😣
"How fucked up this country can be" Christ if that ain't the truth. You were saying...
Sounds as Manson family🤔
John can you talk about illegal export of e waste around the world
Stop eating animals and everybody wins, for a multitude of reasons ( apart from big food companies who care about human life as much as they care about animal life). Eating animals encourages the likelihood of zoonotic diseases like......Covid.
So basically American companies are grossly violating human rights. The US should be invaded by the great America immediately.
i live in a small town in iowa with a prison and a suspiciously large immigrant population with a lot of meat packing plants.
You gonna tell me that you have never worked for a company that had a pool every year on which celebrities will die?.... The only diff here is our conversations are out there for the world an no longer private
The American political system is ill equipped to deal with corporations in any reasonable amount of time. All the politicians are bought off or gone too soon. On the other hand, ultralight aircraft are cheap and easy to stow away from nosy neighbors, and google can help you find materials mentioned in the Constitution, as well as corporate board members.
I find It depressing that we learn more on a comedy show like this than our “news networks” across the board.
I feel like this episode was cut and pasted from an earlier season but I can’t find it still watching thou
so what exactly is the difference between China and the USA?
Kapitalism < Socialism.
Vote for a politician that isn't bought. But the history clearly shows otherwise.
Whats the opinion going to be when all these jobs are replaced by automation?
When I was a kid, all I wanted was to move to the US and live there. Now that I know how fucked up the country, I don't know if I even want to visit it.
whoever's disliking this is either the kid of some Texas Chicken Lord or the texas chicken lord. Slimy buncha greedy do-nothings

First of all, reduce meat consumption by 70 %
And what would you say if I said..so what you are saying is you can literally tell Liberals to eat $h!t..  As in Liberal, KS....
Why didn't he mention how Drumph signed an executive order to keep the plants open?  Doesn't anyone remember that?
I am still more upset at Tyson meats than I am at the Oliver show for that unnecessary cheap shot at Roseanne.  What the hell.  Nobody reads my shit anyway.
I will never come to USA to pursue a dream, it's pure shit show, it's capitalist China
No idea about the US, but here in Germany the vast majority of workers in meat plants are bussed in from poorer European countries and are often not even paid the minimum wage. The conditions don't just suck in the plants themselves but also due to the fact that they're housed by the companies (and often indirectly with sub companies to avoid legal troubles) where they're crowded. These dorms suck a lot as well, and often wages are withheld or not even paid.
At least Roseanne had a good reason for saying her stupid, thoughtless shit.  Ambien is a helluva drug!
These millennial douchebag writers have turned my boy Ollie from America's most crucial journalist into a fucking puppet!!  Saying stupid, thoughtless shit like that has flipped a lot of good people to the Republican Party, or rather the scum shell of what it used to be.
well we like cheap meat right, so we can be an overweight country.
We all know john oliver prefers fudge packing instead!
It wasn't much but I sold all  my 100 shares of tyson foods.
Essences of democracy with capitalist thrown around. Whenever Americans think, health is also a right under Constitution probably then the state can look into state owned and run hospitals.

I like watching Brits complain because it makes me feel intellectually better than everyone around me.
I know why I’m a vegetarian more and more.
The quality of the product is not getting any better when they are processing at 45 parts per minute. The numbers are getting out of control. Humans should take it easy on the meat.
Whole Foods Plant Based FTW!
One of the best episodes in a long time! Please focus on companies and cooperations. I feel like trump has fucked you up, but since he isn't president anymore you are a little bit like you've been in the early days. Focus on that! Really liked bed your show back in the day and i feel like you're getting back to the roots.👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I wish John would make an episode consisting entirely of updates of past episodes. Would love to know if any of these segments bring about change.
Capitalism is inherently evil.
Whatta ya know? Reason 1 billion why no one living in a first world country should be eating meat.
These plights plague all food plants not just the meat packing industry.  From a meat/cheese/and many other packer...
Just for fun, google "Tönjes scandal Germany"..........
What is Texas trying to do?  Out Florida Florida?
Lulz, if he wants to drop more bombs he should come to Ohio. The shit that happens down this way... JCPennies Distribution center in Columbus Ohio. That place openly tells employees that is they vote a union in they will be fired. Union voted in they shut the place down renamed it then reopened and anyone who voted in favor of the union where not rehired. Same place fired an employee for getting hit with a toe motor then moved the concrete safety pillars with old ones so it looked old to back up thier lies.
The dirty use cytologically spoil because firewall importantly dislike excluding a agreeable pentagon. sable, rotten degree
If someone really wanted "to make America great again", they should probably be interessed in things like this. As this is a current video they clearly don't.
he should just make this show serious. the jokes take away from the seriousness of what's at hand - and they're rubbish jokes.
It would be interesting to get an assessment if corporations and politicians allowing atrocities like these, could be pulled in front of the human rights court in Haag.
все правильно, коммунизм сам себя не построит нужно все отобрать и поделить
This is globalization get used to it when you're competition has no rules you end up doing the same
Fuck man I seriously ate a few of those Smithfield Pork tenderloins over the past year and they are ALL made at that factory in Virginia... no wonder it tasted funny!
So, think John Oliver doesn’t eat from any of these companies? I get a kick of everyone who talks about the injustice then lays down their money that supports them... I know he’s not vegan and if these are the main industries then every time you drop a dollar you support the industry.
the US is so screwed. get out while you can. esp. if you're poor. trust me - it's easier to be poor almost anywhere else.
As someone who has worked in a packing plant that went through 18,000 hogs a day, it's not this bad. It's so much worse.
This country needs the return of strong, effective unions.
A real family business should share profits fairly with all family members
Tbh meat eaters and people involved deserves to be eliminated from this planet. Hope they all change or die soon
Finally, someone talking about the humans. In Germany, meat factories are enorme places for Corona infections. No one is talking about it anymore.
I was hoping you would talk about fair trade.
The most important thing to remember when considering OSHA: no matter how stupid something seems, regulations are written in blood.
plant-based protein packing,not the same ring to it.
And when the grand work-condition humanity restoration project is finally fulfilled, as in “replacing workers w/ machine”, another grand national issue of unemployed mania is gonna launch out. What a beautiful world ~~  (Is our government still working on UBI or anything at all??)
People worry about sociopathic superintelligences ruling the world. They're too late, we already developed corporations.
Company: bUt We arE fAmilY!  me: Ok, i'm out...
Perdue and Tyson are easily among the most corrupt corporations. The worst of the worst
As a rule of thumb that i operate on. Whenever a company says our workers are family, you just know the workers are getting screwed.
We live in a county where the shareholder class is always more important than the workers.  Whenever conservative slobs cry socialism they don't think about workers at these meatpacking plants, Uber Eats drivers making $1 for an hour of work or countless fast food employees risking their health during a pandemic for 7 dollars an hour.   It's time we end the system of rewarding the paper wealthy, big bankers and vile executive scum in vital segments like food, healthcare and education. There is a difference between collectivism and the workers benefiting more from their hard work. Important industries like food production and distribution should be by the people, for the people. This is not a resource that should be monetized and leveraged for the financial gain of the few.
For people who saying immigrant are taking over this country , remember they’re the one working in these factories, where most of the American refuse to work in. I’m myself an immigrant and my mother worked in Tyson for many years dealing with horrible conditions. And No they don’t get pay enough for the job they do.
We learned barely anything from upton Sinclair over a hundred years ago. Cool cool cooooool
Upton Sinclar is quaking in his grave that he wrote about this in 1906 and the same inhumane conditions in meatpacking industries is still happening
Do you support this, or are you vegan?
I love this show, I really do. But it suffers really badly from just talking about problems and never solutions.
Imagine how they treat the animals we eat
Companies that treat employees badly need to be investigated and fine heavily they don't need to be in business any longer
Muckraking in the finest tradition. Couldn’t stop thinking about Uptown Sinclair’s The Jungle, written just over a century ago, which led to a wave of regulations of the meat packing industry. Hopefully this will have a similar effect. Thank God for John Oliver.
So they bet on there families life nice
what can we do to improve these conditions? people to call, petitions, unions, organizations? we’re all horrified and angry and we’re stronger together
The more that the rich and powerful of this country hurt the poor, the closer we get to a scenario like The Dark Knight Rises
I like this video
Hey americans, here is a list of the things you clearly don't want because it's "SOCIALIST" : work regulation, unemployment aid, free healtcare, free education, geography  lessons lmfao, ..... , and corporate tax to finance all of that.
Video is trending in India
Not one word about pay.
Being Racist is not a fire able offense this is a democracy
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
Actually surprised my state was not mentioned in this. The start of our Covid outbreak started at packing plants in a smaller town that quickly overwhelmed the hospital there. If you look at the numbers of infections graphed out that small town stayed on par with our 2 big cities for a while, one of which holds a major travel hub airport!

All the dislikes for this video probably came from meat packing corporate heads...
Im pretty sure every single major corporation is doing illegal things and getting away with it. Workers dying, shady dealings ect... would anyone do anything?. no lol, money go brrr. Cause as long as you make money, the world is perfect. I just truly hate this world and money, it is the worst invention in human history and will be our undoing. Then here comes the corporate pigs with the " the economy is perfect, wages are perfect, workers are treated well, no need for healthcare, other countries have it worse, and best of all our education system is the best in the planet". Fucking joke this world is.
Hold on, .00003% = .0000003, right? If an individual made $40,000/year, if I am doing the math correctly, .00003% of that is 12 CENTS. A 12 cent fine isn't going to stop anyone - why would the equivalent matter to a company?
Damn I saw the thumbnail and expected him to roast vegans... I like the unique perspective here
🤣 M
Do we know how many of their workers are immigrants and how racist the owners are?
You want to talk about Zimmerman?  Three years since her kidnapping, rape and murder, the Hania Aguilar case has still not gone to trial. Her killer, a black man named  Michael McLellan, had  a positive rape kit test for an assault that occurred a year earlier, but local police gave him a "break" and didn't pursue that case--just like all those times Martin just got a slap on wrist on his way to being a career criminal. It should also be pointed out, if John doesn't. that most of the victims of this story are Hispanic.
Showing video clips 5 years old,  32 years old etc  is accurate in 2021?? Well done. Very bad journalism if thats whst you call it
This isn't just meat packing, walmart does lots of these tactics as well.  BUT OSHA itself also has scummy things they also do.     The fines they give don't care if small or large business, a small company has and does go out of business to getting a simple fine because it will be same fine as a large company would get.

I'll gladly pay $1 more for a 5lb bag of cheap chicken if these workers get bathroom breaks.
"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”–George Santayana  So now we have to have this man repeating Upton Sinclair only this time around I fear far fewer will pay attention and be willing to do anything about it.  We climbed up only to stumble back down again. *sigh*
We never learn, do we? For the record, I'm eating less meat.  "Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle to  expose the appalling working conditions in the meat-packing industry.  His description of diseased, rotten, and contaminated meat shocked the  public and led to new federal food safety laws... Sinclair wrote the novel to portray the lives of immigrants in the  United States in Chicago and similar industrialized cities. Many readers  were most concerned with his exposure of health violations and  unsanitary practices in the American meatpacking industry during the  early 20th century"

Geez. :(
Eating vegan doesn't sound too bad now
Just watching food inc. had me not buying Tyson anymore
Midly aggressive pigeon... #spiritanimal
The answer to ALL of these problems is a solution that is coming soon. Replace all human workers with robot workers. Now you don't have to worry about sick employees, people getting hurt, losing money in lawsuits, etc. You just fire the human workers, invest in expensive robots. People go poor, but now businesses don't have to deal with the headache that's the human element. Problem solved.

This would actually be an interesting watch without the horrible “jokes”

Namaste bitches
Upton Sinclair didn't do enough.
Esperando que algún dia lo subtitulen en español 😅
I think hourly is a better method of pay, as you only have to work the hours you get paid, and the company won't rake you over the coals with a BS schedule where you end up making the same amount for more hours.
Put options.
All of this has to be done quickly? Guess nothing will happen
When I see dislikes on a video like this I like to imagine that a far rightist saw that this was advocating for rights and immediately clicked dislike while murmuring, “ga damn liberals “ 😂😂😂
When I don’t like a job I move on.
He talked in great depth about the physical toll these workers endure, but failed to mention the psychological effects of having to kill for a living. Slaughterhouse workers face disproportionately high  levels of depression, suicide, anxiety and domestic violence.

John Oliver's team and investigative reporting is just so top notch.
Fuck. John Oliver’s back. Shit’s real again.
Truth to power: Oliver is an excellent judge of how American systems do and do not work.Sigh
Screw these companies, people treating people like robots, I really hope they are reincarnated as their own products: a chicken with its beak removed stuck in a cage unable to move it's entire life.
So sad 😔
The tyson factory in sherman, texas lied about having a ton of covid cases. I dont remember how many, but when word got out we were set as the worst county in the country for a bit.
I'm not from the United States, but aren't unions the result of this type gross miscaring for workers? I suppose like with Wall Street the big money babies cried about that being socialism.

What the 🤭
We desperately need a 100% general strike thats the only way to get these fuckers to see they need us more than we need them
You are awesome
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME! HAHAHAHAHAH. Plants don't give a fuck about the workers. They treat them no different than the meat on the belts.
Sadly the easiest long term solution to this is to remove the workers, and increasing regulatory pressure will push companies to push automation harder. It’ll remove a lot of these unsafe jobs but won’t provide new sources of revenue for the workers. Short term victories by improving health inspections, increasing fines, and enforcing better work conditions should be pursued, but the incentive structure for these companies is such that creates pressure to produce at a ridiculously high rate and minimal cost. These cheap meats are a major source of nutrition for low income families, so it’s not like we can replace them with a slower made, higher cost product. Everything is interconnected, and I don’t know the best way forward.
Yeah this is why I’m vegetarian
This guy knows all about Meat Packing,
No difference between humans and animals. No humanity.
Bro what essential working place doesn't have a deadpool going during Caronnavirous. Its the sick messed up jokes that get you through the risks of the job.
Remedy = go plant based
Cmon Oliver, you’re going to talk about meat packing instead of some democratic issue such as TJ ducklo being a sexist asshole, the new cages for children at the Mexico border, the hundreds of thousands of jobs lost due to Biden banning the pipeline, the millions in Texas losing their power, and Pelosi wanting to build a wall around the capitol.......  And you want to talk about meat packing.  SMH...
I was diagnosed with pneumonia and bronchitis... I was sick for weeks. Fucked up. I quit. Stupid assholes
I think this could be said about a lot of food production. I mean you have workers in California turning to methamphetamine to cope with the workload. You have similar stories coming out from Amazon and other warehouses. UPS is also an example. There’s so many examples of this happening that it’s despicable.
I instantly loved this show when I watched it but now knowing that Daniel O’Brien from cracked is one of the writers is fu**ing awesome. Thank you for this content mr Oliver and all the great writers
I'm thankful that you're bringing this to our attention, but do you need to use the F WORD? I'd like to show this to my kids but your language is a bit much.
Y'know, with stuff like this, I think we're gonna end up being extremely grateful for COVID-19. We might even have a national holiday celebrating it for saving us from ourselves somewhere down the line.
Something we agree on. Wow.
Unionize. And nothing here is particularily surprising :(
The day conditions are finally what they should have been all along:  LoOkS LiKe MeAt PrIcEs ArE GoInG Up AgAiN
One more reason to stop eating meat.
Consuming meat at the rate we consume it is killing everyone.
When I worked a day at a chicken plant in lebanon pa I was made aware it was 7 days aweek 365 days a year minimum 12 hour days.at $10/hr. We had 3 15min breaks. I quit after finding that out that and the 1 guy who was stabbed 10 ft from me which gave us an extra 20 min break
This reminds me of the work conditions inside the amazon fulfillment centers
So the only thing WE can do is tell the people that are understaffed to do better and/or wait for the people in power to do the right thing which we all know DAMN WELL they never plan on doing?...welp, they're fucked.
Any decent person would be willing to pay slightly higher prices if it meant slowing down production lines to manageable and safe speeds. Paying a few cents less for meat just isn't worth it if it means frequent worker injuries.
Hello fans! I invite you to Join Ro Lyss and SUBSCRIBE, please
Not to mention overworked and underpaid
Fucking capitalism, no protections for workers or adequate compensation, just cogs in a profit making machine
Not much has changed since The Jungle
Before you write a comment: think about what you ate today. Maybe its time to go vegan.
Go vegan
Anyone else see the cash buy in for the dead pool, and think thank god they did not do that at my worker.   I would have way overshot the actual.
More like meatpacking Gulags. Such free market capitalism, much wow.
Just another reason to stop eating meat!
Worked in a meat packaging company. People lost fingers, hit major arteries etc. Trigger finger is common tennis elbow etc. I have respect for people who do this work. They get treated like shit. U forgot suicide rates are very high. Also, Idaho made it illegal to record anything in slaughterhouses after one ranch was caught torturing animals. Way to go Idaho.
Remembering that JBS grew in the USA using Brazilian tax payers and workers money. (source: Car Wash operation)
Just even more reasons to boycott BigMeat & Dairy and go vegan.
If we truly were aware of how the things we consume are made and brought to us, none of us would sleep at night.
Boy oh boy, am I happy to live in Finland...
Slavery is alive and well
Don't talk shit about Tyson's medical aid team. Their nurses are handpicked from the best schools in the country.
13:39 Or as stark as Tony Stark
I'm kinda surprised that this week wasn't about the Texas power outage or #TedFled. Equally horrified and disgusted, none the less.
We've got to go back to rigid enforcement with inspectors in the plants. Capitalism must be chained, harnessed and placed into a choke hold of regulations. Otherwise it will eat the country alive from the inside out till there is no money left... Yup.
RIP TIGER
Hourly workers are disproportionately immigrants. Not a honest comment to just pull out racial disparity as if that’s the reason their treatment is so poor.
2,403,361 deaths were reported in the U.S. in the year 2000 ...All died from Death... None from Corona beer in flu ridden mexico ...
That's why I've boycotted these companies for decades.
@Tyson and co: NO ONE wants meat from workers in diapers, injured, or urinating in the work line. it's gross. This is our FOOD. that's dangerous and unsanitary. 'Nuff said.  Seeing this makes me actually want to be vegetarian.
Flashbacks from an episode of Bones where a poultry processing plant worker killed his boss by pressing his head in a chicken beak file
Jesus is coming back, please love one another and help the poor. Follow God and stop all forms of evil.
Just a note to all viewers: this is how the CCPV started....  So, before you start demanding compensation from China, remember that our inspection and safety standards are bought out by corruption, and we're not doing anything to fight back either.
Even while what comes before is appalling ...@15:38 OMG America is a seriously ridiculous country. There is absolutely no labour protection !!!!!!
In case you’re somehow still on the fence about going vegan...
This is just heartbreaking.
Anyone working at these companies should use "secret recorder" and meet other people who are experiencing similar issues (especially if they're worked beyond the probationary period).
Dear Mr. Oliver, 'Long-time listener. First-time caller.'  This episode is way too informative and stressful. I miss the usual Oliver-funnel effect, wherein you're only considering a finite amount of the global shit-storms. But obviously everything is bigger in Texas...  I do not like that man Ted Cruz, I do not like him on the News...
John Oliver, if you ever need to vent, you can call me man.
John, this is an important topic, for sure. But what the fuck? There was an insurrection, we want your take on what transpired in the interregnum period between the election and Jan 20.
I can’t even imagine how immigrant people working in places like this might be treated ..... geezus The question now is ... how can we collectively help advocate for workers rights ?
12:26 does anyone else think the way the light reflects on his glasses make it look like he has demon eyes?
We can change this by voting with our dollars. They can’t treat worker badly if they go out of business. We need to stop buying meat from these companies.
Wherever you look in the US its corrupt, inhumane, and plain disgusting. The leader of the free world? 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
Pathetic comment section, pathetic show.  No Upton Sinclair. SMH
These plants are only located in states where Tyson has successfully bought the legislatures so nothing can be done against them.  If a state passes laws to protect meat packing workers, Tyson just changes states.
Unions are the only way to fix problems like these. It won't stop corrupt politicians but unions can help make corrupt politicians work for you. The only way the normal worker gets a fair share is if they stand together, collective bargaining is the only way forward.
Considering this and recent events, it sounds like Texas is a shit hole.
Danny DeVito: "Anyway so I started eating chicken chips"
ah, looking at the news clip when there were only 250,000 deaths... those were the good old days...
I gotta disagree with you here. That painting of peacocks fucking is pretty awesome.
How did nobody at that distribution center just "accidentally" ram a forty foot truck into that despicable statue of that despicable freaking weasel?
I worked in a cali Perdue chicken plant in Petaluma ca and everyone was black or Hispanic. I was the one of 3 white guys and everyone was like why the fuck do you work here white boy? I thought y'all were wealthy? I'm from southern Illinois and factories are our life blood. I've saw how the companies used and abused the minorities it was was right in my face
I’m actually taking a really cool class in college called the history of American consumerism, and the meat packing industry has always been the same. It’s hard because 8/10 usually will be honest but then the rotten businesses bring on government regulation and it stops small businesses from being able to compete.
john you are getting covid chub
Sir John Oliver, please post more often.
I never made my family piss under their workstation
Upton Sinclair is in his grave going, "Seriously?  Stil?!"
Any company that says you are family? They are screwing you every way they can.  Every time.  It is the instant WE ARE CROOKS statements.
Another reason, on top of the many reasons why I switched to veganism.
Better just add another trillion dollars to the military budget.
It would be great if the meat packing industry in North America could be cleaned up and the employees treated properly but unfortunately the majority of people care more about getting cheap food than anything else.   They don’t care that that the people working in agriculture and food processing are treated like slaves when the companies can get away with it, that the processes used to grow food are destroying the soil, the water, the air, and the future, or that the whole system is being used to strengthen large corporations worldwide at the expense of family farmers and small towns.   To have people working in a safe environment with a well regulated, properly staffed safety organization behind it then the cost of food will go up. Anything that will cause the price of food to go up means that the vast majority of people will be against it even if it’s their long term interests. We are a short-sighted and stupid race.
Good Lord, the past years I have done nothing but regret moving back from safe cozy Denmark.  I miss my union, I miss my civil rights. Why are people so opposed to unions in this country? Why don't they stand up for themselves and each other.
we should all go plant based or cut meat from our diet.  I have and literally lost 15 pounds and feel healthy.  I avoid red meat and pork and working on cutting chicken 80%.

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." -John 3:16
Is this really a segment about "company makes workers report to work while covid-19 spreads" and targeting it at a specific industry? I got news for you: every single company in the US (at the very least) that needs people on site treats there workers all exactly the same way. I can tell you that first hand, as I'm sure everyone else can. It's "safety is the most important thing - after you get your work done." This isn't news so much as it's 'look out your window and put what you see on youtube.' Wtf kind of shit is coming out of this show recently? did you morons run out of shit to talk about?
We need unions again.
This world is so fucked In every way
What do we expect from capitalism murica...
They don't even give contractors free cigarettes like they do their employees so I guess that keeps them from getting cancer although there's tobacco floating around everywhere in the air making people sick included me who I couldn't even afford to go to the hospital because the crappy health insurance that you have to pay for well you even only making 9.30 to an hour
Message me if you want to know more about the crazy things and rjr's Warehouse factories for machine cleaning
i initially read the title: "*meatjacking*"   read it wrong.
I can butcher a chicken faster
You should look in to RJR contractors and how much they get paid for there work try 9.30hr starting and tops out at 15hr to clean out tobacco pans in a lift all most max out and scooping up the tobacco and putting it into a big canister the size of a hill and clean the dustrooms and expect it to work overtime with very little health benefits that you have to pay for their contract agency is Debbie staffing and they take 50% of all employees pay that works @  RJR
Wish I knew about the money pool
"Immigrants are taking our jobs" get the fuck out of here with that shit
I love meat cow deer horse dog even cat
make a video about the massive Best Buy layoffs!
The government allows this
All of the dislikes are meatpacking CEOs and big whigs and their burner accounts
Anyway, I'm dead inside.
As a person who worked in a food processing plant that shit is not for the faint of heart you literally work all day for a check that’s nothing and can’t even get a break until someone comes to relieve you on the line and then they have the audacity to have a point system that makes it where you can’t be five minutes late
"This product may contain 0.0001% poor people meat."
That's my man Oliver.
Was getting ready to eat when i started watching this, decided to come back after dinner.
What he’s saying is true but his little comments in between are not funny at all!  I guess using the F word makes it funny
American capitalism disgusts me
I live in Greeley Colorado an drive by that jbs plant frequently an the company has put up a memorial for the workers an has bought signs in the town to help spread awareness. No one knew how bad covid was going to be an shutting down a major packing house.... How's starvation going to help stop covid.
I think the animals being slaughtered here enjoy a quick and more humane death than the slow plight endured by the employees that handle these animals.
how do we cancel a chicken factory
sad! but this is how it works 💔 my friends worked in samsung company and same! no toilet breaks ( woman when have periods wear red sticker so they have can have toilet break) one man suffered from heart attack and they cover him with boxes so ppl can work on lines... ong and yes! one person lost his whole arm!!! and so many cuts on material...
Did someone call for the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch?
what a great day to be a vegetarian 😌
Just admit it you googled miss piggy sex tape as soon as he said it.
The USDA is now headed by the CEO of Monsanto. We're more f***ed than you think ..
Put em on full blast lmao hell yea
@10:41  This Pilgrim guy looks like a Spitting Image puppet. Can't wait to see him in the next Phil Collins/Genesis video!
True. But. We also have to make families accountable for relentlessly pressuring farms and food companies over the past few decades to make even more cheaper fast food in even bigger portions.  They can only do this by using crap inputs and treating employees like crap. This consumer behavior is also a race to the bottom driven by consumer insanity as they now have an obesity and chronic disease epidemic hitting their families. John O please add this madness to your next piece.  Lets pay for real food in modest quantities and pay workers real salaries and benefits.
Nothing will change.
This is why you should start buying your meat from local butcher shops and farms. Not big industry.
Isn't Capitalism great.  Isn't tricking people that Unions are bad and doing everything to prevent them awesome.  America, we never ended slavery, we just changed how it's done.
68.3% Black, Hispanic, or Asian...does that mean the other 31.7% ARE WHITE??? Numbers are fun.
Is it any surprise that Worker’s Compensation has been turned into anti-worker institutions. The republicans in most states have basically ruined the WC plans and it all comes down to Greed and Profits.
The grumpy morning terminally trace because pheasant partially matter versus a possible architecture. disgusting, massive willow
Boycott Tyson everyone.
Hey US, if it makes you feel any better: Meatpacking plants in the Netherlands are the exact same kind of revolting shitshow.
So, the solutions would come from the OSHA and USDA. But, who are the controlling members of those organizations, and what financial interests do they have in their respective industries?  Nothing will change if the people in charge are the ones making the rules from which they're benefiting.
If Tyson is a family, the guy in the ad is the annoying grandfather who takes everyone out of his will
Fund the inspectors from the fines.  Hmm.  No, then you get a lot of bogus findings.
never trust a company that claims it's employees are family.
Just saw the Lion King, please don't do these kinds of remakes where you are pitted against someone like Rowan Atkinson, you make a terrible Zazu
This country really fucking sucks in many ways for a large chunk of the population. This “America is #1” bullshit is dragging us into the ditch. I can’t blame Stevie Wonder for moving to Ghana.
We all know that working conditions in poorer countries where our clothing is made are terrible, but not nearly enough people are aware of this modern human slavery in the West
Unions people unions need lots of unions and actually representatives that take care of people..
The US food industry is f***ed up
All these places preparing viruses, Oh humanity is disturbingly stupid but all people say is wear a mask! And disgusting a man pees in the place, the pork has shit and piss to begin with. I swear humanity is fucking ill. Those people deserve to get sick.
The US seems more and more like a fucking joke and satire project  like what the fuck
No wonder dems want open borders. They lost the meat packing workforce and the lobbyists are livid
So bill gates is pushing fake meat and is buying up farm land. Here comes John Oliver ..  Collusion ??? Maybe
Just one little thing and this is against CNN. "... when coronavirus raged uncontrollably in the spring..." Uncontrollably? No. UncontrollED, yes.
seeing this, I just want to take everyone responsible for this crap and string them up
Would it be my dream to find J.O. on tinder?????
And all of those TV hosts are going home to a meat-filled dinner.  "Gee, that's just awful!  Pass the wings, please."
This is nothing. Read a book called "Slaughterhouse" by Gail Eisnitz. The stories in that book (mostly taken from Congressional testimonies) make this look like a fluff piece. And the only thing any of us can really do about it is stop eating meat. I did it 30 years ago and I've never looked back.
And of course I choose today to try to make thai beef salad for the first time. With packaged sirloin lmao
América, the land of the free.
Anyone else feel like now they have to watch 2 hours of funny cat videos to purge their brains of what they just saw?
My family ranks below Judi Dench but only Judi Dench as a cat
U.S.A.nistan!
Meatpacking Is, was, and always will be awful  "The Jungle" was written in 1906 by Upton Sinclair.....115yrs ago It was an immigrant (1st generation american) job then It was awful then It was published backthen by left wing socialists to promote their agenda. (look it up)    In order to be able to start at the bottom (to rise to the top, i.e. "The American Dream") ...there has to be one.  Immigration and desperation undercut effective unionization so MeatPacking is just that. The Bottom
One of the many reasons I never buy these products. I hope people are aware of their part in this. When the masses want cheap meat it will be produced under horrible conditions.
I get my meats locally along with local eggs.  Fuck these companies with a splinter laden broom handle.
Dude if you think the conditions of humans in these facilities are shit wait until you hear about the conditions of the animals
Well, would you look at that! Capitalism at it again.
...John would you please consider looking back at your previous stories about automation and food supplies before complaining about the meat packing industry? Because you're lighting the fire to make all those people no longer have a job.
I hate to say it, but this season kick-off is a tad on the boring side. I’m sure this schlump won’t last, though.
more important than revamping OSHA and the FDA is putting your money where your mouth is. Support local farmers via farmers markets for your meat buying and/or reduce meat consumption. Companies like these only respond to financial incentives, so hit them where it hurts.
I just love how the solutions to all of humanity’s problems are: eat less meat, reproduce less
Make America Unionized Again.
God this makes me hungry for a hamburger. Thanks.
The differences between the offices and production lines really is something. I work in a on site lab at a meat processing company (we take time based samples from the lines and test them for E. Coli) and it’s definitely a weird place to see cause you can really see the difference between the people we are in contact with from the lines and the people from the offices. Most people just don’t interact with the lab so it’s hard to get a beat in conditions but you definitely hear horror stories from the line workers that the office works treat as morbid gossip. Also as someone living in Greeley, weld county’s Covid counts have been insane all pandemic and most of the come from the JBS plant. It’s all a mess and awful tbh
STOP. EATING. MEAT.
@12:20 I thought it was bad that I had to write my own incident report when I scalded my hand
I hate how fucked up the world is. God knows what happens deep under the covers.
I’m glad we no longer have that goon as president so now we can get back to hearing the subjects we don’t know are terrible like it’s 2015 again.
https://youtu.be/It6JfkgBFSk
how about stop eating meat 🍖🥓 🛑 .. just sayin'..
Tyson "family" sounds a lot like my family.  They're a-holes, too.
I'm amazed by these companies, like the ones in this video and Amazon, that take pride on treating their office staff really well but treat their manual workers like shit. The only way this makes sense is to conclude that they don't think of their manual workers as humans in the way they think of their office staff.
Huh, almost like flooding the country with millions of immigrants every year is bad for workers rights? Being pro-immigrant is just bootlicking billionaires.
its amazing having to sit here and understand how worker ownership would fix every single one of these problems, but just know we are going to be stuck under the thumb of capitalists profits for the majority of our lives. these stories will just repeat over and over getting worse each time.
Has anyone noticed that EVERY SINGLE PERSON shown in the clips is extremely obese? (except for our incredible British host) I have never seen so many obese people in such a short time (yes, I do live in Europe) things seem to get worse in the US... Maybe they all should stop eating meat - or just stop eating in general for a while... This whole system is and makes people sick on all levels: „this is disgusting!“
I feel for the workers but Like 7 -8 dollar rotisserie chickens at Sam's club
Yet people keep working there cause it provides for them. And people keep buying there food. We all dont care as long were not the chickens.
Always be wary of any business that proclaims to treat you "like family".
These idiots who want open borders are the reason we have such uneducated easily taken advantage people desperate for work.
I need to reduce meat to a day or two a week.  It is not just animals that are suffering. Advanced Thanks to America for making me a vegetarian
More regulation and stricter enforcement is not going to cut it in the long-term. Sure, it'll work in the short term, but what happens when there's a change in administration? What we need is a labor movement that fights for worker's rights and basic human dignity as an remedy to this neoliberal hell-scape that our political leaders have built up over the last four decades.
"That's an outrage, and it's disgusting! What can we as individuals do about this?" "The most obvious thing is that you could stop supporting these companies by giving up meat." "...................yeah, not gonna happen. What's something that we can realistically do?" "Well, if that's too much for you then you can still send a strong message if enough people agree to at least cut back on meat." "................. what else you got?" "Ok, this doesn't even have to be permanent. We only need to make it clear to the industry that we won't be supporting them until they reach at least the bare minimum level of humane treatment for the animals and their employees. Once they feel the profit loss changes will be made, then you can go back to eating all the chicken chips you want." "Look, maybe I wasn't clear. Is there anything that we as individuals can do that doesn't involve any effort on my part?"
This guy is light in his LOAFERS"  WHAT A CREEP!!!
Thank you for standing up for the little guys.
God poops. John oliver: holy shit
This is very similar to a cosmetic factory I used to work for, they don't follow the covid protocols, they constantly treat their employees like dirt and work them to the bone. Almost everything you talked about happened there as well.
Someone should murder the responsible people one by one until they decide that maybe they prefer to live with a bit less money taken from slave workers instead of dying.
The near silk natively pause because entrance analogically stuff beneath a silent week. impolite, succinct swimming
Love the divorced kids joke john
There really is just no hope for society. I feel like it's too far gone. There's no fixing this shit.
And most watching this will continue to give them money.
maybe ... unions? ... not such a bad thing after all (?)
Why can't we just stop participating in such shit. I mean, it's almost the same here in germany. There seems to be a red line withing the meat industrie. They probably treat their animals better than their slaughters. What actually each and everyone can simply do is stop eating animals. ...ohhhkay, yeah, I understand... It is not that simple, because... Right: You don't give a shit. It tastes so good bla bla. Every fucking meat caused so much harm to out planet and to the animal as well as to our species. Stoping that is way simpler and easier than quit smoking. Just quit eating dead animals drowned in sugar sauces.
Well just happy just shit like this doesn’t happen in my country because of laws forbidding such usage of the Human workforce
And the GOP is fighting to keep Americans from making $15/hr in 2021. Smdh  They have no deserve to keep this economy up and running because workers aren’t gonna do this much longer, we will find better things to do with our time, and how to make money. Good luck get ya meat ‘Mercia!
Most of the homeless population are in Democratic ran cities
Another solution: Consumers should stop eating meat and funding these inhumane death factories.
Capitalism: treating animals like shit and humans like animals... piss in your pants or we fire you.
"What can we do?" Well I hear guillotines are pretty fucking effective
the more i see him, the more i realize how he doesnt apply percentages to the net numbers
Hahaha the diaper thing is 100% true I know not 1 but 2 people that do that at the kohls warehouse in san Bernardino, California it's EFC-2 we do all online orders and it's hard to hot pace for the older people sad but true n a tad funny not gonna lie 😅
I am so glad I dont live in the US. I mean Hungary is tending towards dictatorship, but still.
I'm sorry but what in the blood-soaked protestant hell was that commercial?!
+
I always believed a fine should be percentage based, as this is a fairer system of fines, meaning no matter how much money you make, the fine is still reflective of the punishment.  If you fine a company 15% for an infraction then a company that makes 100k a year gets fined $15,000 while a company that makes 1mil get fined a %150,000, which makes the fine fairer across the system, regardless of the size of the business.
Hey John. Im trying to reach out to you from India. I know you already made an episode on Modi/BJP almost an year back. But the situation here is getting worse by the day. Almost 0.6 million farmers have been protesting outside nation's capital in makeshift tents for over 7 months now. Lots of them have died cause of the blistering cold. The worst part, common citizens who're raising their voices for the protest are being arrested under UAPA act(Unlawful activities, commonly used to book terrorists). Mainstream media is running government's propaganda 24/7. They even went as far as calling people like Rihanna and Greta Thunberg anti-Indians. I feel fear just reaching out to you. This is how screwed up freedom of speech has become in world's largest apparent democracy. This feels like straight outta Orwell's 1984. Kindly look into this issue and provide any and all sort of support you can provide. Things are getting really bad here.
16:30 I think the bigger check was taken by the lawyer of this company for working on the case.
I'll give you a chance again John if you'll stay out of politics.
It is decided John. You are here as a legal American because you could not deal with having milk and butter and cheese on the counter at room temperature anymore. And so you naturally came to the United States where that is just wrong
I'm so glad I live in communist/socialist Scandinavia and not in the third-world shithole the USA has become.
whats wrong with that betting pool?
One word solution: Unions
Maybe just don’t eat the corpses of murdered and tortured animals....
Ah I've missed my weekly Jon Oliver making me depressed and laugh at same time.
Majzoobi official must be visit BEST media channel 👍👍👍
Old news I saw this for years in coal mines easier/cheaper  to pay fines/bribes  than fix safety issues
PAY your politicians. If it's not your wallet, it'll be the wallets of Corporate America.
Luck sir! Even though I appreciate your comedy and IM fervently trying to press it on others which never goes well thank you! I still had to look up Judi Dench you couldn’t just show me a picture?
I’m working class and it sucks. If only I could be fat working behind a desk where I need to do dumb ass low impact excise to feel better about myself.
That's the golden type of jobs people should thank trump for.... so that he can have his fuckin cutlery made of gold
All employers are criminals with in state laws.
This reminds me of the Amazon story he did a while back where they barely have time to use the restroom and when they do, they skip the hand washing part and go back to customers packages with urine soaked hands.
It's 2021. Why are we slaughtering animals at all when we are well aware of the devastating impact animal agriculture has on the planet, on the climate, on our health, on the factory farm & slaughterhouse workers and on the animals? Every grocery store now carries delicious plant-based alternatives to meat, fish, dairy and eggs. What will future generations say when they see footage of modern day slaughterhouses?
Yes this is working in America.
Ah this week's version of "Things I didn't know I'm pissed about with concerned British man"
Consider Veganism! :)
thats absolutely appalling how some of these hard workers are being treated.
Unfortunately John, this isn't happening only in America. I worked at a meat company in Germany and it's just about the same. Out of all the workers on the work floor then about 95% of us were immigrants. We were payed 10.00 euros an hour for having to do over 1500 pigs in a shift. Along with that we were only 50 workers on the butchers floor. Along with that our shift hours ranged from 8 hours to starting on Friday and leaving at 2 am the next day. On the butchers floor the were about 10 of us actually somewhat qualified for the position. The other workers called us, "samurai" because of how fast we had to use our knife. On my second day, I had to give first aid to a collugue because his bicep was cut open by another in an accident, but he refused to go to the hospital in fear of loosing his job. We weren't allowed to have water with us, but once every couple of hours when a new batch of pigs were slaughtered we had to run to the water fountain, grab a quick drink, and then run back because a new line was coming in. My grandfather worked in a slaughter house during the 70s, he himself couldn't believe that it's gotten that bad.
When you consider what goes on in 1. slaughterhouses, 2. meat-packing factories and 3. fast-food restaurants, why would you put that stuff in your mouth?
Excellent video. The desk jockeys get treated like kings and queens and the factory workers are treated like dirt. Shame on the 3.5k that disliked this video, the truth hurts.
Vegan for two years for the brutal conditions for the animals and humans.  And FUCK Tyson!
Root cause: Meat is FAR too cheap.  Critique these companies with one hand, but don't eat a fucking big mac with the other.
I always watch his shows high, I don't understand and haven't learnt anything
Firing someone for seeing a doctor is a stupid idea. You have a 0% chance of winning the resulting lawsuit which will also expose your gaming of OSHA rules and probably get you shut down. (I’m dreaming, republicans have decimated the power of regulatory agencies)
What can be done?  Don't eat that shit. EOM
And this is why companies need to be regulated. The purpose of goverment is to protect its citizens, not enable corporations to make as much profit as possible.
The big problem is the structure of USDA itself.  The same department that promotes and supports the companies that make the food are then the one that has to regulate it.  USDA's main constituent is the meat companies. Even the program that inspects meat to determine it's quality is a voluntary program.  The FDA and the other parts of USDA that regulate the food chain should be moved to the Department of Health and Human Services.
Why would factory managers use a technique for stealing from npcs in Skyrim for an inspector tour?
A minimim Universal Basic Income and a lot of problems would be gone... Badly treated employees could just quit and the company has to appear worthy for potential hires.
There are no capitalists in Heaven.
The Tyson plant manager implemented a DEAD POOL???
I love John Oliver💞 But I hate and love at the same time the information that he shares with us😬💞🙏🏾

Im come to the comments to fight vegan-nazis.
John has a potty mouth.
On top of it all, think about how much of that food goes to waste. Is it reaaaalllyyy worth it to push workers to those speeds when much of that is wasted by consumers and distributors? "The United States is the global leader in food waste, with Americans discarding nearly 40 million tons of food every year. That's 80 billion pounds of food and equates to more than $161 billion2, approximately 219 pounds3 of waste per person and 30-40 percent4 of the US food supply." (www.rts.com)
Joel Salatin at Polyface Farms has the solution to this problem. Instead of 4 large companies doing the work, there should be millions of small community facilities. Actual family farms that butcher their own products.
A great follow up to this is to watch SuperSize Me 2: Holy Chicken. He calls out the chicken industry, big time.
I used to work at an apple packaging company and they are just as bad as meat packaging companies. My first week I was unable to be relieved from my station to use the restroom and I had to wait over an hour before I was able to clock off and rush to the nearest bathroom before my bladder exploded. And when it comes to getting injured and needing to go to a doctor, dont even get me started. I was fired because I had a scheduled appointment with my primary doctor (it was a serious checkup that i needed to have done since I hadnt been to a doctor prior to that in over 4 years) and they told me that I either come into work that day or I wouldnt have a job. I chose my health over that job and I advise EVERYONE to choose your own health and safety over your bosses stupid demands.
Vote for Trump, he will "Make America Great Again" and solve all your problems!
You're so hot when talking about meat. And Judy Dench is a global treasure.
just another day in hell world
Did I somehow read it as methpacking! yes im I going to stay anyway? probably
😍
workers' conditions are not getting better in every industry, in every country in the world. we need to seize the means of production and redistribute the wealth to serve the working class. then and only then this problem will be over.
When a grocery store can buy whole chickens for pennies, the production lines are moving too fast (I was a grocery store butcher during the panic buying and lockdown) (partly due to restaurant sales were eliminated but restaurants usually don't buy whole chickens and they were too cheap before covid...)
I worked as a security guard in Smithfield in Illinois and I got hired last summer and the security that trained me will tell me all this crazy stories that there was a point when they close the warehouse because there was people dying from Covid so a lot of the employees refused to work so the fired them all and just brought temp agency employees
Great video John. You're truly doing some phenomenal investigative work.
Reason 5,674 why i'm a proud vegetarian!
America:  Shitting on the working class since 1776.
Them pizza parties kinda fire though 😎🔥
that commercial gave me nightmares in the 90s
Nothing mentioned in big news net work like CNN or Fox News, such news should be appear in comedy show. This is beside of all animal cruelty.
usa is a third world country period!
Remember, if they all refuse to work. THey won't earn a penny.  Unions are good.  Ape together strong.
JO.... I don't get HBO where I live but I have watched every episodes of yours in YouTube. You are my favorite talk show host, for whatever that means...
John only talks about the first outbreak, but the JBS plant in Greeley is already on its second. It started in November and as of 2/17 almost 100 people have tested positive
gop states......
Convenient that Bill Gates talks about the "first world" moving away from meat then John Oliver rans a "story" about meatpacking plants in the SAME week. Hmmmm...
Cluckingham palace 🤣
lol murica. keep up the good work. such a messed up country.
"LAND OF THE FREE, HOME OF THE BRAVE!" - Hahahaha, biggest joke in human history
thank you!!! i have family in this industry and they deserve to be seen
These are living sentient animals. Not meat.
Follow @lets_be_fit_with_me instagram account for some nutrition tips
They should invest in game stop
People being enslaved to kill enslaved animals to mass supply the flesh of the dead animal slaves? What did you guys think was happening?
The book ‘Fast Food Nation’  reported all this 20 years ago. So 0 progress... jeez
*sighs deeply in German* Some of the worst breakouts last year over here were in meat packing plants, where the vast majority of workers are also, you guessed it, immigrants.
Things are shockingly similar to conditions at meat packing companies in Germany.
Just stop eating meat.
Capitalism kills and profits from it.
I criticize capitalism through my MacBook while watching YouTube, analyzing a video of a man with a suit in a big tv channel adding ads for corporations producing trash items in Chinese slave factories giving my biggest talking heads in my Social politics Univeristy course while drinking my late and rocking my new Nike shoes ;)
No wonder they hate your freedom ..
Waiitttt JBS. Isn't that the company covered in the Patriot Act about how companies are destroying the Amazon rainforest? If so, then I guess JBS is Just BS.
Great content but how can we get a version of your videos without you trying to do comedy? Thanks in advance.
Did you seriously never mention unions? This show is chicken shit, refuses to make any actual statements  'workers right are awful in the US', N O  S H I T , anyone who has worked a job here could tell you that.
❤❤❤❤❤
America’s institutions are FUCKed 🙄🤦🏽‍♀️😡
I ate meat today. But i raised, slaughtered and processed this animal myself.
I worked in meat packing in europe. I always wondered about the factory before ours, where they slaughter the meat we process, in bulk. Crummy work. Reasonable pay due to the cold and weird shifts...
Go Vegan
25k down votes for general information wtf
Thank you so much for the show. Brilliant as ever. I think it would be great if your episodes were translated into more languages (Russian, Arabic, Spanish and French to make it available to non-English speakers) because the world really needs more John. Best wishes from Latvia
Stop supporting the exploitation and murder of animals. #govegan
Capitalism. The problem is Capitalism, not the system itself, the gross mockery of itself it has become.  Pretty much all of these problems are just its symptoms.
It makes me happy that John can say "our country" since he is a citizen now!!!
Wow.
Meat packing facility is a euphemism for slaughter house. That is where animals are sent to be murdered for your burger. Watch Dominion @dominionmovement to see inside this industry.
Just wow, never before have I been moved to consider stop eating meat all together until saw this show
The Federal government should institute a three strikes policy: first strike: serious fine (about 100x the current level), second strike: fine equal to 10% of the company's profit for the previous year, third strike: company is nationalized and administered by the government as a public service. Want to cheap out on winterizing natural gas pipes and let people freeze to death? Be prepared for your power company to become a utility provided as a public service. Want to exposed your workers to deadly pandemics while they're forced to shit into diapers because they can't leave the line to use the bathroom? Be prepared for your meatpacking plants to become public services, too.      The best part: allow the nationalized public-service companies to undercut privately-owned companies. The speed with which corporations will rat out their competitors' unsafe conditions to prevent creating a subsidized public-service competitor will be astonishing.
And in a few years, those workers will be b*tching about how robots stole their job and ruined their life...
When I drive recklessly and kill a person, I get charged with manslaughter and face a prison sentence.  When companies act recklessly and kill a person, no one is convicted of anything and they get a small ass fine.
Good thing we live in a democracy so that govt oversight can't be corrupted
Fear Factory song kicks in: "This is America and I love America. I love America!"
My god what a F#cked up country....the american dream, more the american nightmare.
Ok, John, I think it's time you also did an exposé on the other end of this consumer food chain. I work for a top 3 food retailer and since the pandemic hit, have never been busier. Although the conditions aren't as egregious as the meat plants, I recall you doing a piece on the conditions of Amazon warehouse workers. I saw a spike in appreciation and concern for grocery workers initially, and some harsh truths being spoken to Americans by people such as your fellow HBOer Bill Maher, telling his audience that there's a portion of America delivering Grub Hub without medical benefits, for gig work and low wages, and a good portion of Americans comfortably ordering the food. Unfortunately, he meandered and lost that narrative; I don't advocate pity or outrage, although the public has all the power to change things and it seems nothing's shocking anymore. Politicians, and corporations, can get away with outrageous statements and it's not only met with blank eyes and the sound of crickets, there are actually individuals agreeing with these statements. I think it's important to keep exposing people to the hardships others go through so that we can perhaps repair the thing plaguing the world most, a dearth of empathy. Working in retail, we're on our feet for 12 hour shifts frequently,  pulling 60 hour work weeks, doing physical labor, being exposed to customers in a fashion that guarantees no social distancing. I think it would be beneficial for everyone to see, or better yet, work a week's worth of shifts, to help engender empathy. And I'm fortunate that I have an automobile and a place to live, and only work my current job. I have older coworkers, working all day at my job, and picking up shifts at second or third jobs. I've also known several coworkers who were/are homeless.
god im so glad i dont live in america
Andrew carnagie warned this was going to happen 90 years ago
Wait until our corona virus breaks out. This country is moving too fast in the meat industry and the FDA gives a Ok. We may be fucked soon
Meet have to be more expensive. It is ridiculously cheap. We should treat meat as a treat. Not a base of a diet.
Given how abusive my family was, I don't want to trust any company that says they're "more family than company".
John Oliver is like Navalny but for capitalism
Wait, so.. The same industry that unnecessarily tortures & slaughters billions of animals also mistreats its workers? Shocking!
Who told professor duncan to pack the meat
I live in a meat packing town. The supervisors love posting racist comments publicly, constantly. I feel horrible for the amount of latino and hispanic workers.
Why I boycott tyson
My friends, it’s time you unionize.
Didn't watch/listen to the video. Just wanted to take the opportunity to say: this guy is not funny!
Don't worry John, just tell them it's their own fault for having to be in a meat packing facility because they didn't work hard enough.
You made it to the German trends lol
Oh how I’ve missed you John.
Nurses are even worse in schools. Seems like they aren’t allowed to even do first aid. They literally only provide Tylenol and ice packs. But at least they call parents lol
I used to work in the canning industry in WA state. Over the course of four years i worked at a total of 7 different fruit canning companies. Only one cared about worker safety.Del monte canning company were strict about safety. If your caught running in the production area you are fired immediately. If you are caught not wearing gloves and ppe in the production area you are fired immediately. They don't screw around with workers safety and treat their workers pretty damn good. You can opt in to the teamsters union if you want but don't have to since the work is seasonal. Every other canning company i worked for (hansen's, snokist, johnson foods, Seneca to name a few) were bad to awful. None of them cared about worker safety with hansen's being the absolute worst. At that canning company they have no bathrooms, only porta pottys outside(in the winter) that do not get cleaned out until after production is over. So imagine going to the bathroom in 10 degree weather in a porta potty that hasnt been cleaned in 3 months. Plus out there all the hiring done at most jobs is through work agencies. They have a monopoly on it. Some of those companies dont have weekends off and require their workers to work 7 days a week 12 hrs a day for $9 an hour for 3-4 months.
Just go vegan. It's the best thing to do.
I'm curious how 3.4k viewers disliked this video.  I guess we know what Tyson Corporate staff has been doing.
These big companies only care when it affects them, and not buying their products will do just that. I buy from local farmers and no longer eat chicken, beef, or pork. I refuse to give my business to those that treat their employees and even their animals with little to no regard.
In the small town where my mother is from a Tyson plant is the source of income for an enormous portion of the Black population living there.  It is not a freaking family for damn sure.  Oh, and they also created a small trailer park mini town where immigrants live, within walking distance of the chicken plant of course.
People comparing this to "The Jungle" are cringe AF. Im glad the fair reporting caught the horrible conditions Americans face compared to other countries that clearly respect child labor laws like China or have worker benefits like every 3rd world country. lol
Ohhh, so THAT's why there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. Holy shit this is fucked up.
It’s on your mother, billy. She is a difficult woman to live with !,  I can never have enough of his sly little jokes that he sneaks into his show.
Pretty cool talk what about rokos basilisk
Just fucking automate these industries amd give people fucking ubi this is not cool man
Most people don’t realize that the cannabis industry is turning into this. I worked on a farm that had osha called because we were being mistreated. We worked from 4 am- 10pm. I spent so many hours in the sun that I ended up in the ER with 2nd degree burns and Mrsa on my throat and chest from not having gloves and working with soil. I’m order for everyone to keep their jobs, we had to lie about the conditions of the job to OSHA. This is the hemp industry at its finest. They treat all their workers like shit and the pay just gets worse every year. I remember three years ago I was being paid 20-22/h to work outside, clone and transplant. And now? It’s 15/h and taxed so you’re making $12/h. I just don’t even bother anymore. The industry has changed with legalization and it’s gotten worse, not better. Now we get treated like any other warehouse employee rather than what the industry used to mean decades ago and how much we used to make back then.
Without jokes for Donald Trump you are so boring John Oliver
So tired of companies pulling the "we are a family" bullshit. Every company i have ever worked for that says that tired line is full of shit. I have NEVER felt like a family member at any job i have ever worked and i have ALWAYS felt like a worker that was disposable no matter how good i was at my job.
8:24 This isn’t just a problem in meatpacking  Hundreds of other industries do this. I had a friend nearly lose a finger to this BS, and I’m sure you’ll find much worse stories
Do pubic transportation workers you will be surprised
You have a problem with George Zimmerman selling his personal property?  A free nation is not the right place for you
Ah! The glories of capitalism!
There was an incident with an employment agency referring an employee to a meat packing plant where the employee ended up getting his hand caught in a grinder and the temp agency was fined for not training the employee with no mention of the safety training or conditions in the plant. OSHA punished the temp agency that placed the employee for not keeping the employee safe with training but may have not held the plant to account.
why mistreatment of workes in meat processing factories happen in USA? Because no workers union why mistreatment of workers in meat processing factories happen in Germany? Because we hire estern europe workers ... which are NOT in any union and we can pay them the bare minimum wage since hiring workers from Germany would mean to agree to standards and wages they don't want to pay
time to go vegan everybody!!!
This guys is so bad
This oak is a shill
Are we really suprised when the companies that benefits from the Animal hollocust dont care about thier workers? There is something everyone can do to stop this, its as easy as cutting down on your aminalproducts or going vegan.  Peace (Y)
We really are living in the early 20th century aren't we
That sucks. I thought OSHA would be like the corporate inquisition and everything gives way when they come for you.
Some places will fire employees for calling in sick. Even if it's a legitimate call in and not because of last night's party. That's the truth about the economy and how the working class is treated.
Make stockholders liable for a corporation’s debts. People who want to be stockholders would reallocate their resources to corporations that they knew something about, that weren’t engaged in risky, toxic projects. (This would encourage local, sustainable businesses & healthy local economies. Imagine that.)
I thought he was British until he started talking about "our country"
These companies need to be put out of business...boycott the crap out of them!
Many thanks John for uncovering things that we are not aware of. At least not at this level. Keep rocking and stay safe.
10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. Nuke the Whales. 2. I started out with nothing and I still have most of it. 3. Change is inevitable, except from a vending machine. 4. Out of my mind. Back in five minutes. 5. A clear conscience is usually the sign of a bad memory. 6. As long as there are tests, there will be prayer in public schools. 7. Laugh alone and the world thinks you're an idiot. 8. Sometimes I wake up grumpy; other times I let her sleep. 9. The severity of the itch is inversely proportional to the ability to reach it. 10. You can't have everything; where would you put it?  Editorial: Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.
Everything comes full circle- even as a human you’re disposable- just like the meat.
Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken!   The best country in the world am I right? LUL
dont hate on miss piggy. you know youd watch it.
Here is 1 cluster of ideas for rewriting the Defining Law of corporations. It’s not a 3-point plan & it’s not the beginning of a 20 Point Plan — just some ideas to think about:  1. Prohibit corporations from owning stock in other corporations. Owning stock in other corporations enables corporations to control huge markets and shift responsibility, liability, resources, assets, & taxes back & forth among parent corporations, subsidiaries, & other members of their unholy families. By defining corporations in such a way to prohibit such ownership, much of the anti-trust regulatory law becomes unnecessary and superfluous.  2. Prohibit corporations from being able to choose when to go out of business (in legalese, no voluntary dissolution). This would prevent corporations from dissolving themselves when it came time to pay taxes, repay government loans, pay creditors, pay pensions, pay for health care, & pay for toxic cleanups.   3. Make stockholders liable for a corporation’s debts. People who want to be stockholders would reallocate their resources to corporations that they knew something about, that weren’t engaged in risky, toxic projects. (This would encourage local, sustainable businesses & healthy local economies. Imagine that.) These 3 measures might seem “unrealistic” to some, but it beats the heck out of a voluntary code of conduct, or a wasted decade at a regulatory agency. All 3 of these provisions were once common features of state corporation codes. No wonder corporate apologists prefer that we hang around in the regulatory agencies with our heads spinning with parts per million & habitat conservation plans.  These 3 measures were quite effective, which is why corporation lawyers worked so hard to get rid of them. But they address only a tiny portion of what needs to be done. Here’s another cluster of ideas for ways to shape a democratic process that is about people. (The idea that corporations have “rights” would seem nonsensical to any but a colonized mind.)   1. No corporate participation in the democratic process.  Democracy is for & about human beings. Corporations should be prohibited from paying for any political advertisements, making any campaign contributions, or seeking to influence the democratic process in any way.   2. Corporations have no Constitutional rights. A corporation is an artificial creation set up to serve a public need, not an independent entity with intrinsic “rights.”  3. Corporations should be prohibited from making any civic, charitable, or educational donations. Such donations are used to warp the entire social and economic fabric of society, & make people afraid to speak out against corporations.  These probably seem even more “unrealistic” than the first batch. Imagine how good it is for corporate executives that we find these ideas “impractical.” And by the way, these were all once law, too.  The final objection to be raised is that we’ll never get anywhere as long as the “news media” are against us, refuse to cover our issues, and distort our views. Agreed.  But the “news media” are corporations, key players in a system of propaganda that encompasses not only television, radio, and newspapers but also the entire educational system. The “air waves” belong to the public.  Why have we allowed a puppet federal agency to “lease” the public airwaves to huge corporations? Ya wanna lock down? Lock down to a TV or radio station & make the public airwaves public again. Not for a day but for a lifetime.  Ya like boycotts? What if a regulatory agency gave a hearing & nobody came? The outcome would be the same but we wouldn’t have wasted all the time & resources, nor would we have helped grant an aura of legitimacy to a sham proceeding. What could we do instead? We could get together with the lawyer & the expert & begin to figure out how to stop being collaborators.  “Colonized,” written in 1998 at the request of editors at Earth First! Journal, was never printed in full form there because they... couldn’t deal with it. It was first officially published in DEFYING CORPORATIONS, DEFINING DEMOCRACY (Apex Press, 2001, ed. Dean Ritz), a book that includes several other pieces by the author.
I want to work for OSHA. Are you hiring? Serious question.
if you think about it the entire pandemic started because of eating meat.  but to get back on topic, I feel bad for the workers and and the animals that are being mistreated in these meatpacking facilities.
Well, if those companies treat you like shit, fight back with your guns. Practice the freedom. Burn those plants down.
I live in Arkansas by Springdale. Tyson foods only says the workers are family to be able to manipulate them easier.
This is nothing short of thinly veiled slavery.  My heart breaks for the family featured... 30 years without calling in sick? You don't treat loyal workers like... the meat they shovel on their factory belts...
Stop eating meat is a great first step
I BECAME A VEGETARIAN DURING MY YEAR, AND ONGOING, OF COVID LOCKUP.
We have barely made improvements from the 1906 novel by Upton Sinclair called, “The Jungle.”  You won’t find this subject on Fox News and you can thank Republicans for that
Can you say OSHA? If any worker at these plants is reading this, call OSHA anonymously. Call state EDD and report anonymously. Go to these "nurses" first, then go to EMERGENCY ROOMS.
You wanted capitalism, you got capitalism. Better dismantle those communistic institutions of workers comp and osha completely so you can enjoy capitalism to its fullest.
this isn't just meatpacking plants. this is ALL plants.
Sorry you do not have a family like mine. It may be your fault, think about it.
Capitalism is garbage
What a shame!
Welcome to the American Dream and the greatest country of the world! Predatory capitalism at its best.
America is literally a dark future fantasy like cyberpunk. How on earth do people see this and think this is ok? „Oh, it’s not me this time, so I guess it’s ok!“ or something like that? I can’t comprehend that. Every American I met on a personal level was friendly, honest and caring about others. How is it that THIS is happening to your own people? We have crazy and bad stuff here happening, too, but this is pure evil greediness happening in front of the whole nation! 😣
.5 % death rate is pretty weak...
John, you are a true gift to the world.
Hey, John Oliver, when are you going to make the change to vegan, or for starters vegetarian. Put your mouth and digestive tract where your reporting is.
Powerful story here John.....on behalf of all AMERICANS, we thank you for turning your unblinking eye on this horrendous industry!
Plainwell, Michigan during covid. A meat place called JBS had over 50 confirmed cases during the first week of it lockdown. Spread so bad, that my job at the time as deliver for Pizza hut closed for 2 weeks from someone's spouse working at the meat plant. Don't believe any corporation about "FaMiLY", do nothing for free, take all you can when it comes to a job.
Ah yes packing meat that thing my ex girlfriend  constantly told me I didn't have
If you treat animals like raw materials, then what do you fecking expect?
No no no... I don't care if you "feel it's nessisary" to piss on the line of a food packing plant.    People felt like they needed to storm the capitol what someone feels they need to do is not a valid argument... I'm sure these companies suck but you are still a shit person if you choose to contaminate a food supply because you "feel" a way.   I have a gastrointestinal disorder have worked on a factory line, (not food) and have never no matter how hard pressed thought it an acceptable thing to just relieve myself on the line let alone felt it so okay I setup a system to do so.  Literally no one should be willing to accept that regardless how that guy "felt" that was the good choice. The company might suck but so does that person regardless of if anyone at the company knew this was happening and I'd bet a few thousand dollars they didn't.  Bad starter for a real issue.
I'm a paramedic. I remember getting called to a factory late at night once for a worker injury. When we talked to the patient he said he needed to make sure his supervisor was okay with him being transported to the hospital. After a 10 minute wait that included two overhead pages for the supervisor to show up, the supervisor said my patient couldn't go to the hospital with us since all that was required was for him to be checked out by a medical person before he returned to work. The supervisor said normally during the day they have an onsite paramedic who handles stuff like this but they only work during the day which is the only reason they called 911. The supervisor actually told me I couldn't transport my patient claiming some company policy. I told him if my patient said he wants to go to the hospital with me, he has that right and there was nothing a third shift factory supervisor was going to do to stop me. That's when he walked away. Both me and my partner told our patient that we didn't give a rats ass about their company policy and if he wanted us to take him to the hospital we would no questions asked. The patient elected to drive himself to the hospital. Both my partner and I told him that he needed to file raise a huge stink about that. File a grievance with his union, call the media, what ever he needed to do.
ALL slaughterhouses are nazi cincentration camps.
Family!!?! 🤨🤔 let's not forget that this country has a history of enslaving and selling their own children for the sake of free labor and the almighty dollar.
Meat packing? I thought this would be about the content of my pants! Woof woof!
"Stretching over your desk" Omfg lol
WOW this guy is just not funny. How did this crap end up in my feed?
There is a reason why I worked 2 Jobs while attending University. These people could have done the same. No sympathy.
Ahhhh, the ol' "box on the head" routine.  A classic.  Used it on my first wife whenever we had sex.
but but but..... WHO WON THE COVID-19 BETTING POOL?!?!?!?!
I had to write a paper on The Jungle (by Upton Sinclair) specifically how it's changed since it was published in the 1900s. I turned in one page that simply said "it hasn't", she gave me an A.
I just want to remind everyone vegetarianism and veganism are possible.
The defiant segment resultspreviously disagree because thrill pertinently glue like a jazzy inventory. splendid, coherent windchime
go vegan
Stop eating animals please let them live peacefully😓
So my dad actually worked in jbs for like 20 some years and he had fmla, he is of very old age too I can confirm that in JBS plant in Louisville KY if it's anything like these other plants they'll have a nurse on site and one day the nurse sent my dad home and I quote her words were  go home this isn't a prison because of how bad my fathers condition was that day due to strain the nurse was at least a bit kinder and knew sending him back would do no good. My dad had a supervisor who started punishing the rest of the team for people who missed days or called in there's so many accounts I have from my dad about working there I could at this point write a whole book about the mistreatment of workers in JBS alone.
What blender joke was WEAK
Urgh...I love the taste of meat, but this makes me want to become a vegetarian.
haven't watched john oliver in a fat minute and his hair so grey now
Wow. In Latvia we get scared if an inspector for food quality or health and safety comes for an inspection. Becuase if something isn't up to snuff, then it's a big fine.
It's nice to see this show return to something that isn't so directly linked with politics and covid. But I will say, this is the first episode in 4 years where John didn't bring up Trump in some way. That's not an accident, I don't trust this show anymore. No one is that consistent in their message without a bias applied towards them.
Capitalism otherwise known as KILL FOR THE ECONONY
I never thought that working in a concentration camp for animals wouldn't be fun.
Worked at an egg factory, we should definitely look into those conditions as well
we had outbreaks at meat packing plants here in Europe too, sigh  clearly more regulation is needed
If you can’t take the work then quit.  Life is hard all around.
But don’t forget, pizza party at the end of the month for the team with fewest COVID deaths
As an Iowan, I was disgusted and embarrassed when finding this out months again.
Unionize and strike
Hey! It’s Last Week Tonight with John Oliver!  Time to get enraged over another injustice in my country.  Fucking corrupt corporate companies!  Goes to show how corrupt our government is when it lets this shit fly.  Bickering over the stupidest things while corporations treat people like robots.
The one thing all of us will do is never boycott chicken! the smallest sacrifice is too much to end this problem...oh well
You should do a video about the workers in Call Centers, they are also treated as a human answering machine with limited bathroom breaks.
corrupt item #183,726,482,190 that nobody anywhere will do anything about !
A modern Dystopia.
I'm surprised he didn't add in the Tyson plant in Logansport Indiana that implemented a Covid safety check of employees that consisted of taking their temperature before they came into work.  Sounds good, except people with fevers were still sent into work.   Also, Indiana Packers, a hog processing plant over in Delphi Indiana had over 100 employees with the same social security number.
never cried watching a youtube video until today
That is absolutely disgusting!  And absolutely nothing will happen.  Which means one of three things.  a.) The people with the power to do so do not think it's bad b.) The people with the power to do so are being paid to not think it's bad c.) The people with the power to do so do not care  The fun part is figuring out which is which, and how high up the chain it goes.
I hate this country so fucking much. Fuck the United States
Can we just throw these monsters in a prison? They hold thousands hostage, its absolutely disgusting.
It's possible to relate important issues without being a dick.
Tyson is such a slimy company.
Yea... this is fucking gross.
Land of the free market
Olivers Hierarchy of Needs...
That's because most workers are Hispanics and people of clor
It is very telling that our current World of Darkness campaign isn't that much worse than this.
America is so fked. And the funny thing is, Americans want to keep it that way ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I have another idea: GO UNION. And strike. But I am just a biased European (Austrian to be exact), with strong unions, 14 annual salaries, 5 weeks of paid vacation per year and a functioning health care system, what do _I_ know?
So a man who unnecessarily tortures and butchers billions of birds, has paintings and sculptures of birds around his "Cuckingham Palace".  No surprises there then: just like the masses who love dogs yet eat pigs (they can't see it either).

wow what a difference a laugh track/live audience makes
Save the animals! They go through extreme torture for no good reason. Substitues are so good now there’s no reason to support these companies they are extremely terrible to people and animals.
The workers are treated poorly.  The animals are treated much worse.  Do some research.  It's absolute torture.
Been vegetarian for over twenty years. Never regret it.
I would just not be able to do this work/  live this life. If I was forced to do this job without alternative, I would rather get criminal or maybe just kill myself. A horror-ending is better than endless horror. I would prefer to get homeless. This is no real Job. Its slavery in one of its worse forms.  Other topic: Did the inspector put the box on her head? What happened when she was asked for. And what happened next? Sounds like a good story. Did it REALY HAPPEN!?!?!?????
America is a third world country wearing a gucci belt
Anyone else tired of hearing companies say that their "employees are their most valuable asset"? Bish, human beings are NOT assets.
Me,a Brazilian *sees a JBS logo* : oh no, we are going downhill from here.
You can help by eating less meat
Dude give up give up comedy right now.
Anytime your boss calls you "Family" they are 100% guaranteed a spot in the fiery depths of Hell
All regulatory bodies in the US have been captured by the industries they’re supposed to regulate.  That’s capitalism baby!
No Trump jokes u POS? A prairie dog is more evolved than u.
Thank you for covering this horrific issue.
And the US really think they've abolished slavery...
#JohnOliverIsDAF
When you flashed the photo of "Poultry CEO" Beau Pilgrim, I screamed.  I really did.
People are more concerned about political parties warfare not about employees welfare.
Nah we love capitalism
Could I also maybe suggest that America as a whole eats too much meat. You don't have to switch to an all veggie or vegan diet. I didnt simply because I like meat too much. But increasing the amount of non-meat in your diet is not very hard and was not even in my eyes a sacrifice. And it helps the climate as well :)
Just so you know, there are dysfunctional families too.
A sad part of this is to see workers remaining indifferent against the bad treatment of coworkers. Seems like a dysfunctional family.
And this is just the tip of the iceberg. There is anything remotely good around the meat industry at any of its different levels.
Best part about being laid off from a corporate job during Covid? They can just chalk it up to numbers. They don't answer questions about why 'you' were chosen. It's just 'byyyye.'
Just as slimy as Biden's performance at the CNN townhall! Cover that story John Oliver!
Bann the consumption of these  products from your menue and take alternative food options. Broadly done, this may change the behaviour of these companies.
me *as a vegan watching this feeling non-guilty for the first time*: heck yea
Look at the George's plant in Rogers, AR.  So many employees lost their lives from just this location.  Sad.
John Oliver: "... if you ate meat today, it probably went through one of them..."  EEEWWWW!!! You wanna clarify that "went THROUGH one of them" statement, John?
John Oliver basically arguing for veganism 👀
When the president of the company describes his employees as "family", it means the employees are being exploited.
I heard the bit at two minutes... That one was new to me. I know where this is going, and... Ugh. Just ugh.
Just open a onlyfans or something stop whining seriously I've bought a small house and I'm 19 .... why people work here is beyond me
Long ago worked one 8h night shift. Did not comeback even for money.
Love this, namaste corporate employees. Hourly employees reminder to watch your potty breaks to 3 minutes.
Consider going vegan. As long as you plan your diet, it is better for you and the planet :)
To think this is the place that processes the food YOU AND YOUR KIDS eat everyday!!!!  Meat eaters criticize me for eating "processed" vegan meat substitutes!!🤯🤯🤷🏾‍♀️  WELL GET A LOAD OF THIS MESS!!!🤦🏾‍♀️
So you're telling me that these meat packing plants treat their employees like livestock? Shocker.
Unethical shit and human blood and body parts splattered meat, for a fucked up mentally ill country.
GO VEGAN or did you need to whine your stupid rationalized excuses first?
Thank God I can make a living off onlyfans...I couldn't imagine living like this
So, any meat producers who treat their workers ethically?
Folks just take all of this at face value, instead of doing their own research
Capitalism without strong, morally-derived & worker-centered federal oversight and regulation is literal evil. Stories like this have given me a literal crippling anxiety to even look for a job for years. I've been lucky and have been on disability, but when that runs out, I'm not sure if I'll even be safe when I go to work anymore, and knowing that there's literally nothing I can do about anything that goes wrong after the bastardization and corporate shunning of unions and workers rights (side bar: FUCK "right to work" states. Just absolutely FUCK them.) to protect myself or my rights to fair benefits and wages, which I will literally need to stay alive and healthy in the face of my expensive, painful, life-long medical issues.
Wait, only 280 died!? Damnit... Jimmy from accounting *is* better than me with statistics and projecting numbers.
Starting to think that maybe end-to-end automation won't be such a bad thing.
Go vegan!!! 💗💗
When visiting the USA, I was wondering how cheap meat is sold. Now, I got an idea of the background. At least for part of it.
Worked as maintenance for a bacon processing plant in Ohio for the last 2 years. Just got canned in October.  This pretty much summed up the entire thing.  I have nothing against immigrants at all, but I find it really suspicious when in the middle of no where Ohio there we have a more than 60% illegal immigrant workforce (Guatemalan) .  This same company falsified SSN's for employees at one point and two even died on the job which lead to an ICE raid on 2017.  Wages for an average worker in production was $10.75 an hour, I have not worked for that low of pay since 2001.  The stress of the place was insane which pushed a LOT of guys to work 16 hr shifts or be held over (8hr shifts being stretched to 12 hrs)  to meet quotas. This in an already 6 day a week work schedule.  While the preached safety, and we had screenings and all that, the company did not permit time off with a doctors excuse. Since we had a point system (Max 6), if you missed a day for illness, you lost a point. Doctors excuse or not.  True the place was union, but when most of your work force can not read, write or even speak that solid of english, its easy for the union votes to just go with the company wanted.  As none of them wanted to bite the hand that fed them (and it has been speculated that transported them there and gave them places to live)  Then there is just the shady things like no direct deposit.  I know that does not seem like much BUT lets remember, the fastest way to get caught with a bogus SSN is to open a bank account, add to that the number of errors that happened in payroll? Yeah Im sure there was some wage theft involved from a group of people who had no where else to work were desperate to stay in the US.  It would just take like 3-4 hours of research to see the history of this place unfold.  Its name?  Freshmark. (Aka Superior brand meats)  Massillon Ohio They have 3 locations in the area, please for the love of all that is holy John, please put a spot light on them. I can offer more pointers as to what to look at and what details I know.  The only thing I feel bad about in all of this is that its one of the few employers in the area. So if they get shut down, a lot of my friends will be out of work.  But this is a matter of ethics. Holding a better standard.  And also pointing to the massive holes in Ohio labor laws being exploited.
Yet people continue to consider veganism extreme!!! Give me a break!
1500+ people infected with Corona and 8 died from it so that’s 1 out of 187.5 people in such harsh work conditions that died from COVID infection in that example given.
Shameful & disgusting...Quite right.   When will people begin to actually care for their fellow man, in order for this to change?  People in this country eat their food with little to no concern as to where it comes from, how the animals are treated & fed, & then how it gets to their tables.  An incredibly selfish society...Shameful & disgusting indeed.
0:25 Bring up the holy hand grenade!
as a non usa'an, knowing that usa is not well known for respecting employees, i laugh when i hear usa people say "surely that is not in our country".  Lol, i get now why they all think they are the best country in the world, because they are oblivious as fuck to what is happening in there
Please talk about the protests and the complete breakdown of democracy in India.
Frequent absenses isn't a good reason to fire anyone during a damn pandemic.
every time i watch his video, i keep saying how bad can this topic be. when the video ends i just want to move to the moon. every. single. time.
I'm just glad segments about Trump and elections are over. At leas for a while XD
Pure madness. Modern slavery in the land of the free. The dark side of capitalism. Go vegetarian!
Meatpacking: when John Oliver goes to his boyfriends house and they play hide the sausage.
'meeerica,fuck yeah!
Can we please swap 'stick mix' for 'immersion blender'? I heard Ramsay say it once and I think the has a better ring to it.
I'm swapping Judi Dench for Helen Mirren
i love how literally none of our systems work
Pushing the "vegan synthetic meat" take over.
The death rate from the covid cases is 0.005%, according to the numbers stated. What the death % from the "normal" work conditions?
my dad used to work in a pork packing factory
Until we the 99% actually march on state capitals and dc wealth inequality will only get 10x worse
Regarding that first as, the guy's last name is french for "lost"  perfect
You can't choose your family they say ;) Ah that's not inapropiate to say fuck you you gonna sleep without dinner on your table, if its family♥
john oliver is so funny without laughtrack
The western civilization never ceases to ‘impress’ with their ‘Sense of HumOuR’!
"Surely this is not our country" . that's racist
This is part of famous American Exceptionalism?
Free market !!! Always ends the same
I thought he was going to mention Adam Driver when talking about animals above him in the food chain X D
All that on top of  all that no contact tracing was done at plants. My husband got sick from going to work and told ppl around him so they can get tested. With people out of covid and understaff companies don’t care they run at full speed
AKA, Upton Sinclair's The Jungle Redux
we really need to stop eating meat before another pandemic kills us all
go VEGAN, problem solved!
Donald should work there 😂
I worked in a Cargill plant in 2010 (summer job between college years). Every thing mentioned in this video I saw within 2.5 months of working there. Most of the employees were immigrants (Somali) and the rest were locals who hated them. Management had to separate them into different sections of the factory because some of the locals were trying to stir up shit.  The speed at which we were expected to work was ridiculous. You literally were not allowed to leave the line to take a break. We received a 15 minute break every 2 hours. several minutes of which was required to get out of your protective gear, and another few just to walk across the factory floor to the break room.  In the time I worked there, one person got his arm caught in a machine and broken, one person got his hand degloved by a conveyer belt, and I had a 60 pound roll of plastic wrap fall directly onto my wrist. I thought it was broken so I went to the manager, who radioed the nurse. The nurse's response was "Well what do you expect me to do about that?"
WTF not a single word about unions? 🤔🤦🏻‍♂️
Soooo much simularities to germany with their east european workers in these disgusting factories ...they even live together with sometimes more then 10 other people in tiny horribly expensive rooms for which they have to pay there boss ..the western 🌎 is f***** up too...one reason I became vegan ....
I really [READS PROMPT] enjoy Last Week Tonight with John Oliver on HBO.  Also, for the record, this shit applies to virtually ANY blue collar job.  Labor workers get fucked day in and day out, while the desk jockies reap massive benefits.
Rest In Peace Saul Sanchez. This shit makes me sick
Congrats on trending
Then I ask myself, what the hell are doing living there? This is nothing new. That people in the US do not have social medical insurance and can die in front of a hospital if you don’t have insurance, or if you have but it doesn’t covers everything, you probably will die paying the bills. No thanks. Nice landscape, nice people until they vote against themselves. Being an average employee in the US is not something good.  This liberal economic thinking will just helps the rich. And employees are not rich.
Easy solution, go vegan. Change slaughterhouses to plant based factories, workers will be safer, animals won't be ruthlessly and cruely slaughtered and people will be much much healthier as will the environment.
ME: If only there was something each individual American could do to impact this situation immediately...like stop eating meat. MEAT EATERS: Um, we really can't be bothered to sacrifice the foods that we enjoy. The workers, the animals, and the earth will just have to keep suffering so we don't have to change. Plus, then the workers would have to be trained to manufacture meatless products, the animals wouldn't have a purpose, and global warming would be slowed. We're looking forward to a hasty demise for the human race via rising oceans, severe weather, and pandemics.
To whomever is scrolling: sending you good vibes for the rest of the day or night. Thank you for reading!
me: I'm not sure I'm going to watch this... also me: I'm still watching...tell me more!
Give them hell John.
Fking workers shouls be united and fighting EVERYTHING that is wrong.
https://youtu.be/sDAzpO2Boo8  Hey there! I know we don’t know each other but idk if you’ve seen me posting about this recently or not but this is the YouTube series I’m starting. We’re in the process of filming episode 2 soon. I’m super excited about it! If you haven’t done so already you should subscribe to the YouTube channel and follow the IG page. Thanks 🙏🏼   @bmoreindi
America really is a sh!thole country
They're don't care about animals so they don't care humans as simple as that it is. 😥
America cares less about meat workers than they do about fast food workers. As long as they can stuff their face for less than a saw buck, they'll ignore all criminal acts and forgive the rest
New Coronavirus's attack on the real estate market is very huge. At this time, what we need to do is to sell real estate companies in the stock market, and let real estate enterprises fail to finance smoothly. This will cause a double blow to the real estate market. So we can win China without war.
I am from a ''Third world country'' called India. But my workplace is actually 1000 times better than these of ''THE FIRST WORLD COUNTRY'' america
Anytime a higher up tells you or the media your company is a family a giant load of bullshit should drop on top of them.
Just go vegan. Problem solved.
Seriously y’all just go vegan... it’s not hard!
America, are you ok?
every time he says "poultry workers" i hear "pole tree workers".... is a segment exposing the dirty underbelly of hipster culture, the hipster strippers, or "hippy strippies" as they're known in the industry the episode we need? free the pole tree workers!
Want to fix the meat industry, from farm to fryer?  Than meat needs to become a luxury good.  Accept that 25% of americans will have little to no access to it, and that the population of farm animals will probably cut in half.
USA, The country that cares more about money than a human life. "in God We Trust" - What a joke!
Vegans doctors are saying that for a long time
I used to process Turkey. You do have to trim fat extremely fast but I was only on the line to trim one specific piece of fat off the meat. It was easy and actually kind of fun. No different than any other factory.
Americans eat meat at almost every meal. You can't supply that volume of meat without these kinds of conditions. Make a choice America, are you willing to give up eating meat at every meal or willing to pay 10x as much for it? Don't blame Tyson, blame yourself.
Eating animal products is simply not environmentally sustainable. Finding protein, omegas, and B vitamins from other sources is absolutely crucial to the survival of humans as a species. We can not continue consuming this way.
It's interesting to think about though. That the rate those plants are churning out meat, the consumers are eating it up as fast as the plants can provide. Big DIETS are big business.
The plastic factory I worked in wasn't much better.
8/1500=.005%... Huh.
Dear John, you didn't even scratched the surface. We've had a documentary here in Brasil about that called "Carne e Osso" (meat and bone) that tells a worse story than this one. An interesting bridge is that JBS is brazilian and it is envolved with serious corruption claims over here. The subject frankly deserves more attention.
more and more i am convinced that you should literally, under zero circumstances, call your place of work "family." it is literally only used to manipulate you. Even if the workplace is seemingly great, just avoid saying family. those two things absolutely need to be separate. Corporate knows that and will keep pumping the narrative, so just reject it outright. to show love for your fellow workers: UNIONIZE
I said years ago that Jon Oliver was the modern version of a muckraker and now look where we are. The snake eats its own tail.
not only the animals are tortured, the people are treated like crap, almost as slaves, and this is in America, americans say it is the best country in the world??? Good God, only for millionaires, because this crap sounds like it happens in what it used to be called a 3rd world country! Thats shamefull!
Thank you for raising awareness about this! All of us need to transition to plant based NOW
https://youtu.be/1cNOgfgzSrQ
There are plenty of POS employees as well though that fake injuries. I'm in the trucking industry and a worthless co worker who knew he was going to be fired for so many accidents, claimed he twisted his knee... He has been on workers comp for 2 years now.
Well, here's the thing: everyone wants cheaper products. They will gladly buy chicken for $1 less at the cost some stranger's health. And if the companies benefitting from people picking the cheaper alternatives have a louder and sweeter voice at the place where law gets made, then this will never end.
I know exactly how that guy feels...at my job, bathroom breaks are few and far between but I haven't peed myself, worn a diaper or relieved myself on the floor yet. I've heard about this happening at Amazon production plants, also.
I get so mad about how shitty people are allowed to be treated in the US when watching this show. I am so glad I'm not American.
Another example of how being British has made John out of touch with Americans. Your list of our most valued things was almost dead on, but not quite. It goes: 1. Cell Phone 2. Food/water/shelter And number 3 is, and you should really know this, is Betty White. Don't get me wrong, we love Dame Judy Dench (which as a Brit, you should be ashamed for leaving out her hard earned and well deserved title), but she's no Betty White. The list of most valued celebrities is: 1. Betty White 2. Betty White And 3. Betty White!!!!! No one comes even close to how awesome she is.
life is built upon falsehood and evasion, offers his life advice: "It never happened. It will amaze you how much it never happened
The cloudy shoulder nomenclaturally water because man exemplarily moan aside a learned pan. unequaled, optimal denim
Upton Sinclair was fraudulent!
jokes on you I don't eat
Well this was depressing
Are you asking the right questions John Oliver? or Are you using this is piece as part of NWO to discourage your brainwashed audience to eat meat? Somehow, you have Bill Gates promoting to drink water "purified" from your own waste but WE CAN'T CONVERT SEA WATER TO FRESH WATER BECAUSE ITS "FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE"....SAME GUY PROMOTING TO COVER THE SUN TO STOP GLOBAL WARMING WHEN WE HAD THE MOST FUCKING COLDEST WEEK THAT SHUT DOWN OUR ELECTRICITY....SAME GUY WHO WANTS US TO EAT PLANTS ONLY AND EAT ARTIFICIAL MEAT BECAUSE ITS HEALTHIER BUT HE CAN EAT REAL MEAT BECAUSE HE IS FUCKING RICH......
How people honestly can give those videos a thumbs down is totally beyond me.
Unbelievable
And yet OSHA sent someone out to my fast food job over a BS noise complaint.
Meanwhile OSHA in CA will put you out of business if you have 2 minor violations.
Pls Story on "indian farmer protest "
Running out of content after Trump left office I see
If you can afford it, you should buy your meat from independent meat producers. It's often difficult to find and more expensive, but good food has a higher value.
I know that's not how society works but how about you put a bullet in the head of the top 5 of every company every 3 month until they manage to raise the safety standards and working conditions to an acceptable minimum ?
This is fucking criminal
nothing against you i think people shouldn't get paid to talk if not helpful like for example white supremacy fox news. so much shit getting said yet people and still get rich in this pandemic. Zero fuck are given America family against family state against state country against country welcome america false dream and only one who live are  the immigrant of the white race.
That meatpacking shit happens at amazon too. Write ups for taking too long of a bathroom break and bathrooms are so far away its near impossible to do it in time unless you happen to be right next to it.
I enjoy watchin this kind exposes thats Jhon does. It makes me feel better about my country, we are not alone in being a shithole afterall.
Not a lot has changed since Upton Sinclair wrote "The Jungle" huh?
they should start a riot
This is what happens when workers have no rights.
The problem I see with all this is that we've built this system on a house of cards. The company can't afford tomorrow to start doing all the right things. If a politician comes in and tried to fix it all they're going to be blamed for destroying the meat packing industry in $LOCALITY. It's all fucked.
Whenever a company uses the words "family" or "genuinly", I assume that they are lying to me
wow, it's almost like capitalism is a terrible system.
I would not wish to anyone this kind of job..
Jesus is coming soon. Repent from your sins and trust alone in Jesus with all your heart. Without Jesus we are nothing, believe it or not. This world is temporary but Jesus is eternal so deny yourself and follow Jesus alone daily because it will be worth it in the end
America is just straight up a shit hole if you're not already rich.
Go vegan
Note to self: Don't eat soup at John's house.
Is the show's new slogan: Horrible facts; horrible jokes? Felt like most didn't land this episode
How about we drop the manipulative nomenclature and call these places what they really are: slaughterhouses.
The work you and your team does....absolutely incredible, honorable, and should be commended and recognized. Thank you for everything you all do 🙏🏽❤️
"a blank $10,000 check" ... 🤦‍♂️
The fact that this show will never run out of material is depressing
Intersection of worker’s rights and Veganism anyone?
BUT BUT BRING BACK THE JOBS lololol.  Really what the fuck America.
Frankly it seem that what we actually need is not to focus on any one segment of any one industry where workers are mistreated, but we should focus on strengthening and getting funding and more rights for all the organizations like OSHA so they can do something about it.
These are not good companies. On the other hand the employees are free to leave. I know beef packing plants were paying $16 an hour before the pandemic and some were offering $20 an hour to get workers back to work for unskilled labor. A lot of these workers are unionized, so the unions should bare some responsibility.  People in the US demand ridiculously cheap food. So unless you want your food to come from a foreign country with NO oversight or regulation then this is the way it is.
Cluckingham palace! And they say Americans don't have a sense of humour...
Damn, abuse and pressure you, treat you unfairly and be racist? Seems like a family to me
"I never viewed this as a company, more like a source of cheap labour.  Like a family.
STOP EATING FACTORY MEAT
A whole segment on meat packing and not a single reference to the only professional sports team named after meat packers.
But why do the workers themselves have to report the terrible conditions? Now that we know about it, why don't WE ALL report them?!
Look up their ptsd and suicide rates too
Watching this while on break at a meat packing plant lol  Edit: literally like all of this is true for me lol
So facilities who deals with killing animals and packaging them as food also treat their employees as meat pieces. What a shocker
In 2004, Human Rights Watch released a paper called "BLOOD, SWEAT, AND FEAR: Workers’ Rights in U.S. Meat and Poultry Plants". It exactly describes these horrible working conditions and why mostly illegal immigrants work there, how bad injuries can get and so on... This isn't - or shouldn't be the first time to come across these facts but since the animal industry is a big fucking lie in general, no one cares cuz everyone wants cheap meat and it pisses me the fuck off. For god's sake, Sinclair published his book "The Jungle" in 1906, it still is relevant today.  adequately
Fucking automate this already. Robots can cut wash 24x7
Am I the only one who thinks this man is not funny and is forcing a lot of his humor....
I just died a little laughing so hard when he made the miss piggy sex tape joke 🤣
my dad works for UPS & his hub COVERED UP a Covid-19 break out that meant he got sick, his coworkers got sick, their families got sick, & presumably receivers of packages from sick workers got sick
It’s insane that I’m learning about this exact thing that happened in the Progressive Era and it’s still not fixed today.
Workplaces like this are "family" in the same way that the mob is a "family".
John how about ending all subsidies to animal agriculture!!
Amazon does similar with it's workers. They use Sedgwick for their workman's comp. Someone should do a segment on that company too
Miss Piggy's sex tape made me laugh!
OMG 😱 Discusting...
It is not different in Brazil: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=887vSqI35i8
The Tyson spokesperson statement about "family" is an example of a very common rhetorical trick.  It is up to YOU to fill in what "family" means because he is telling you nothing tangible at all.
Y’all complain and blame it one some economic philosophy shit. But, none of you would go and support local and available mom and pop shops. Use your spending power to prove a point...
The fix is simple: Local laws should force management to spend one day a week (or even just one a month) working on the same line their factory workers work on.  All this shit will be corrected before you can blink.
I made Guinea Pig tacos - Cuy - they tasted pretty bad. And they are expensive!! $24.99 for one at our local supermarket. Gotta love Queens. Plus my daughter's class freaked out as heir class pet had just died; a guinea pig. Take abut conspiracy theories.
This must be satire
Kim Reynolds, governor of Iowa auctions off free time with her and the meat producers constantly win it, they are also top donors to the Iowa GOP. IOWA IS DISGUSTING!!!!
The price of a piece of an animal never changes. If the price in the supermarket goes down it just means that someone else is paying the difference. Either the animals or the humans working in the industry. If meat was produced "responsibly" most people couldn't even afford it once a week. Actually, there wouldn't even be enough meat for everyone.
'Murica, the greatest country in the world, at f*cking their own people.
is this an industry ripe for automation?
Tyson Waterloo having a Winner Takes All betting pool. And no ABBA joke? ABBA being the Swedish seafood company, not the band, obviously.
Maybe we should change fine laws for corporations from hard numbers to percents starting at 1% Let's see them, commit such inhumane practices when they can only be caught 100 times a year.
My mom broke her hand and she had to work the next day. I worked for these plants many years. It’s also humiliating they don’t give you a bathroom break when you need one. Sometimes none at all all day long. The lines are at a very fast speed. The knives are always dull. It’s horrible. I cried every day. There’s no sick day benefits. Poor families.
USA is certainly not a „first world country“
Fraction of a fuck might become my new saying
We should be rewarding farmers whole actually care and responsibly process meat instead of these conglomerates who only want to produce a product without giving a fuck how it's treated or produced
Tiktok business based on data fraud, number of likes comment fraud, irrigation comments, browsing fraud, manipulating machine accounts, controlling botnet's hot search! We need to follow the rules of falsifying data falsification. Use our powerful technology to create a large number of machine accounts to brush and shake! We need to copy the falsification data falsification strategy, and then use it! In China, data fraud is a means that can be used! We should use the means of the china fake business  to deal with the china !
Very interesting episode. Lights need to be adjusted though as the reflection in glasses was very distracting and often looked like John was possessed when he lifted his head.
Wow , the channel icon has changed after a loong time.
guinea pigs aren't even supposed to drink milk or be outside of a cage.
Oh cool, my best friend used to work at a Hormel meat plant, so none of this is news. Belt grill weekends where hed work just about 30-40 hours in two days used to wipe him out so bad I'd have to pick him up from work. I had applied shortly after him and have always been glad they hired a murderer instead of me.
what exactly are they doing? and what are their duties.? Sorry, I do not understand
I feel honestly sorry for John for having to tell all these crappy written jokes
Im a fully grown adult, if I gotta go to the bathroom im going to the bathroom. My bosses opinion doesn't go into consideration.
Overpopulation and Capitalism should be the primary focus of people who want to save the Earth. Solar panels and electric cars are no more than ineffective gestures in response to the core issue.
I’m used to a laugh track
I mean it’s no secret that Capitalism is a broken system.
Amazing how many evil people read Bibles
Is it worth to immigrate to American nightmare? I believe nobody will if US didn't insist hard on destroying other countries to force phoney democracy and freedom on them.
John, the handheld blender joke, damn that was bad.  You can do so much better.  Or your writers.
Smithfield, VA, right down the road from where I used to live! Stay classy, Smithfield.
Ewww they must have switched writers, its missing the sharp jokes, it just wasn't funny this week
You're more likely to be injured in the meat packing industry than in law enforcement. Police always talk about how dangerous their job is but there is actually more dangerous occupations that don't get the same hype. These workers need to unionize same as police have.
Perhaps Elon Musk could remake the space things into computerized meat packing technology and leave space BE.
"...For the duration of the pandemic..." - Oh, So, for the next 200 years at a minimum?
Upton Sinclair still side eyeing us 116 years later
how can John show the dhitside of capitalism week after week without mentioning the system that causes this? those guys are dieing for profits and nothing else
I used to watch him all the time until he got so radically liberal.
We, the People of the United States of America, reject the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling and other related cases, and move to amend our Constitution to firmly establish that money is not speech, and that human beings, not corporations, are persons entitled to constitutional rights. https://www.movetoamend.org/motion
We need UNIONS
End bribery, conflicts of interest, the abuse of monopoly power and regulate corruption in general.  #MoneyOutVotersIn

Only lying Crooked presidents and slimy congressmen get fair pay......Hmmmm?!?
I'm glad this is getting attention at this level.  I have personal connections with factory works in Iowa and Arkansas.  If I didn't already hate the Trump administration, I hold him personally responsible for keeping all the factories open when Tyson should have been closing their headquarters in Arkansas and slowing production.  Instead I watched my friends get sick and go to funerals all summer.
Meatpacking sounds like a euphemism. Like what Mr Oliver does in the park Sunday nights.
On point as usual John! One idea could be added to this....we could all be vegan and shut these disgusting places down.
friend and family, the only truely offensive f-words in business. only used by people who try to rip you off
Thank you for standing up for the working class. The attention is appreciated. (I was not a fan of the last video) this one is better.
Ah yes the liar is back. What shall we lie about this season?
I've heard of Cup-a-Soup, but never Fuck-a-Soup.  Still, the night is young, and there's nobody here except me and the bouillon.
Missed you John Oliver. Glad to have you back. On the whole, the report absolutely did not surprise me at all. It fits rather well when it comes to overall conditions in the US.
I have a feeling you're an expert on this subject.
where are all the dirty minded people at. “meat” PACKING
Nothing makes me laugh more than John Oliver talking about the systemic barbarism in the US.
Good thing they have unions.
The divorce joke hit kinda close to home but regardless this is disgusting. How money blinds people and makes them believe that they are better and know better than most.
the employees that continue to go work in these conditions are the problem. they are the ones desperate enough allow these conditions to exist.
Of buy chickens whole and less red meat.
This is just horrifying... I'm sorry for anyone that has to work in such conditions and how hopeless it seems to make the companies change their treatment towards their workers...
Wonder if he’ll get a free ride on Bill Gates plane for this
America is definitely not pro-labour. These stories are ridiculous
yeah, i'm sure the corrupt government whose done nothing else besides make all this shit possible (over the last 40 years) will be all over it.
John and his crew need to do their homework, now that Trump is out. Goodbye days of easy garbage scripting!
bUt mUh CapiTaliSM :(((
Correction this is not your country John Oliver
So basically the corporate world is all about exploiting your employees, lying to your customers, and focusing on making as much money as possible...anything new under the sun?
oliver looks like the owl
American economy is hellish, no more worthy of the title- ' the promised land'. It's sad to see that the entire system works against the working class so overtly, only God may know what goes on under the table.
What the...what in the name of all that is holy....? That commercial is just wrong.
How hasn't there been a major general strike in the US against this blatant abuse of power already? Do people have to wait for their politicians to act?
Only Solution is to be a vegetarian... because because because
Animal agriculture is destroying human lives, animal lives and the planet we live on. No matter which way you look at the meat industry, it will never be possible considering the size of our population and lack of land/resources for this industry to be sustainable.
Man I’m not finding John’s jokes funny anymore
Lol! Is this new news for you? Then you are the problem as well. Why do you think food is so cheap? Think deep about the 'great country' you live in
They really should unionize.  Really.  And if all this information became common knowledge, many people would boycott meat and chicken.
This literally doesn’t even scratch the surface
I work at Tyson... it’s a complete shit show and the “contact tracing” is a joke. What they REALLY care about is hiring immigrants and getting that tax credit for employing them.
Wtf that advert at the start.... wtf is wrong with the world
News from America always makes you appreciate that you live in civilized country that has 70% union membership.
This is called Capitalism John
The Depression Show is back
Tyson sponsors Christian refugees from African countries and pays them largely in vouchers for the company store and Walmart. Noel, Missouri is the saddest little town I’ve ever been to.
Bruh Indian farm protests
Just because you get paid doesn't mean you're not a slave.  The US has always operated on slave labor.
this is insane
Go ahead and try.  Upton Sinclair tried in 1905, with his book, The Jungle.  It was supposed to portray those same horrendous conditions then.  But when it was published, all the public cared about were the unsanitary conditions of the meat being produced.  It's  good book.  If you haven't read it yet, I suggest you do.    There's a saying in the meatpacking industry: "To those at the top, there's no difference between the meat on the hook and meat on the floor."  "The meat on the floor," of course, refers to the workers.  Some family.
Does Judy Dench know about this episode?
TYSON CONTACT INFO BELOW: Someone needs to teach these companies about lean manufacturing, kaizen, and jidoka "automation with a human touch". I buy a lot of Tyson products and I'm sickened by this.  Until they improve conditions for their workers I will no longer buy their products and I will tell everyone I know. As a matter of fact I'm gonna call them rn. Anyone else?

Worked 9+ years in a poultry plant, have been working 18 years now in a pork plant. Very little danger, decent pay and benefits and we have never had a bad COVID-19 problem in our plant due to our management early starting preventative actions. And they are still on-going, we had recently our first COVID-19 vaccinations for those who wanted to them and will be getting the 2nd shot the first Friday of March.  And No one urinates while on the line, you ask for relief and if not replaced for bathroom break in 15 minutes Can leave the line for that need.  Following safety regulations in our plant prevents injuries, and getting written up for safety violations helps get people to follow those rules.  In pork plants that initial harvest including removing bowels and bladder are a long way from that deboning and boxing.
Thank God I live in the mountains if we wanna end this village is the key
In a country where 1/3 of the food produced is never sold, having workers work this hard seems like a waste.
Wow doing a show based on a book from 100 years ago, we know that hot dogs are gross bro
Time to say bye to capitalism
I understand why John Oliver is commenting on this, but it doesn't/won't change anything. As sad as that sentence was, it's true. You would literally need to install an entire new office of government that hasn't been corrupted by lobbyist, bribes or billionaires. Hypercapitalism is the stench of this Earth and if anything it'll be our doom.
You want more expensive food? You will get more expensive food.
Saw a truck load of live chickens exposed to 38 degree weather at 70 mph on interstate 95 yesterday...their eyes made me decide to be done w chicken too.
This show used to be actualy funny. Now it just feels like bad news
poor hamster got rabbis. hope dog is vaccinated and poor family rabbis is so dangerous
Meatpacking.. a subject that’s right up John’s alley.
Re: Tyson's Fitness Class at the end. I got $20 says they're all office workers in middle management positions and none of them work the line. I'm sure the line workers were "dissuaded" from attending.
JBS os a very, very, veeeery corrupt company originated in Brazil. There are an humongous amount of scandals here. Just search for it and you’ll find.
I have friends that work at meat packing plants and have heard stories that I thought only existed in nightmares. Nope. Happens here, in this country, across the country, every single day, and has been for decades.
Now that's strange, Trump left office and now the show doesn't do politics...
Meatpacking is the new factory work from early capitalism in the 19 century. The industry has changed, the exploitation has not.
This is 'Murican Corporealism. Pure capitalism.  And when you want to make the work place more safe for the workers, you get called communist or socialist or something as idiotic.  You can demand better, will you?  Welcome to Finland, where the labor laws are better, the unions are strong and work places are more safe.
Tyson is one of the worst companies. I have a friend who was in a wreck due to the negligence of one of their drivers, resulting in his passenger being permanently disabled, and their behavior during the court case would have impressed a comic book villain. Fortunately, the court saw through all of their shenanigans, and awarded the victims a multimillion dollar settlement, and the most upstanding person in all of this was my friend who let the girl who was disabled have all of the settlement, because as he said, “I’m good. I wasn’t injured, and I’m able to make more money, but she can’t. She deserves all of the money.” A multi billion dollar company tried to get out of righting a wrong they clearly caused, while one of the victims was willing to part from his share of a multimillion dollar settlement from that company in order help his friend.
When corporate overlords call their employees "family", I can't help myself to remember a quote from Lilo & Stitch: "Ohana means family. Family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten"
Slavery is still alive, they get paid just enough to not feel guilty letting them suffer
This makes me ashamed to be from Greeley... 😔 I don't understand how all of this can be happening. Are people so greedy they care more about appearances and money than they do about humanity?
https://youtu.be/9yEsS7D7cMM
Great reporting, well done sir!!
Using both sets of numbers he gave, it seems like he's saying that covid has a survival rate of 99.5% among working age people. Am I hearing that right?  I'm asking because it's rare that we get  numbers on a cross section of the working population like this
The show that just keeps on giving new perspectives on contemporary situations
This is one of the reasons I decided to go vegetarian recently. Veggie burgers are not as enjoyable as a real burger and nothing can beat real fried chicken... but when that extra bit of enjoyment means I'm supporting an industry that treats their animals and people so horrendously? I'm done with meat, thanks.
Wowww! What is going on in this country???? What is it with us humans????
Hey ! Hey ! We got that in Germany as well ! Look over here - it's the same ! In fact we invented it ! We are best at mistreating meat industrie workers... noone beats us in exploiting people. I take that back - qatar is better.  Now honestly - we had several bad Covid outbreaks in a meat packing factory - eastern europeans working there under questionable conditions...   If you can - buy local meet - or less. It's the same around the world.
Those who exploit animals exploit humans.
GO VEGAN
One more reason as to why your food choices aren’t personal choices. If there’re victims involved (human and non-human animals) your entitlement for unnecessary “food” doesn’t exist and can’t be used as justification. Every time you choose to eat meat and other products derived from animals, you’re consenting and financing this reality. On top of that, we are all paying the price for zoonotic diseases, including this pandemic, and antibiotic resistance that is leading us to a post antibiotic era, where more and more people will die from infections (yes, even the very common ones, such as throat and ear infection).
The responsibility of this mistreatment of HUMAN BEINGS falls on our society, too: we need to accept higher prices for meat, source the meat  we eat from ethical sources, eat less meat, or all of the above.
"put a box on your head", the fuck kind of looney tunes shit is that.....?
Government is important.
And that's why Republicans like deregulation and defunding government.
Still gonna eat meat lol
Go Vegan! Sae Planet, People, Animals and Yourself!
Never thought workers in a meat factory had so much to endure.
Big ups to Johnny once more
Super size me 2 helps inform more
Thasts ladys and gentlemen is the free market. Companies can do whatever they want. If they choose to give you no pee breaks is because of a free market! I dare you government to regulate the free market and force companies to give employees pee breaks! No way they can do this! Dont let the government dictate your life! s/

You sure this isn't china?
John watch star trek ds9 exploration starts at home.
My son works at Tyson. Their solution to the bathroom problem now is to not allow them to drink water throughout their shift. :-(
Another reason why the government is important, who else is going to rein in the cutthroat greed of corporations?
Great video!

let's hope Mr Biden watches your show and takes appropriate actions
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming
As long as people only want to pay bottom prices for their chicking wings these practices won't disappear.
At this very moment a Big German Discounter advertises for a chicken at 2.36€/kilo price drop of  20%. Conditions of chicken farms are very well controled by animal rights organisations. How about the personell working in the company that delivers the chickens?
This country has become such a dystopian nightmare. I wish there was a way to get everyone on the same page to rise up against these corporate c*nts.
Richest country in the history of mankind? This might be the road Boris Johnson wants to take in the UK’s race to the bottom to become more competitive.
John Oliver gives a good read in the most sophisticated non sophisticated way. I love it here😁
This fucking companies they only care for the shareholders not their workers
Meat packing and other industries treating people similarly are horrible and out of date
Capitalism at its best.
And you just know some sanctimonious vegan is thinking right about now, "That's why I'm a vegetarian!" Utterly missing the point 🙄
If you eat factory farmed meat you deserve to be treated as the animals are
It’s da corporations man....they sit there all...corporaty like.....in their towers....  Meanwhile I’m just gonna be addicted to my phone and be a total narcissist while tweeting about how worse everyone else is....
Man, the lack of a studio audience really takes the joy out of these segments. I was laughing for the first couple minutes, but then it just turned into a downer. No more pandemic John Oliver for me.
That shocked woman in yellow ordered chicken fingers for lunch.
Name one private industry which doesn't exploit its "most valuable assets"?
Watching that I'm happy to live in Europe and pay a lot of taxes
The problem in last week's main topic: Animal aggriculture The problem in this week's main topic: Animal aggriculture  Im noticing a patern here
Is meatpacking really necessary? We just have butchers stores that buy the whole piece and cut it themselves. Sometimes they cut it just for your order. Seems a better system. I wouldn't buy packed meat in a supermarket.
What's the name of the affliction that takes pleasure from the suffering of another? You know, like gleefully chronicling the decline of a nation into a failed state. Schadenfreude???
Capitalism... Another way of saying slavery.
STOP. BUYING. THEIR. FOODS!!!
Considering that those factory workers are working with a growing medium (dead animal) that can foster all manner of compromising microbes without having an immune system to keep such growth in check, I don't think the social distancing is even the biggest problem at those plants. Those poor humans are exposed to untold potential for illness every day which can put their immune systems in overdrive, making any one illness that much more difficult fight. Add deplorable working conditions and shoulder to shoulder constant contact and you have a multi-species petri dish that the CEOs must be thrilled to keep under wraps for the massive profit margin it gets to keep.
Cargill is horrible work place. Hate everyday im there
would've loved hearing him say "they need a fucking exorcist" at the guinea pig part, maybe next time
I thought meat packing factories were one of the first to unionize?
The Muckraker
It really baffles me that some guy can go out of his way to order building a statue of himself reading a Bible, and so much don’t give a flying fuck about welfare, explicitly exploiting his workers. On a second thought, it doesn’t baffle  too much. One wonders what passage he’s reading.
The situation in meat packing factories over here in Germany is similarly gruesome from what I've heard.  Extremely disturbing stuff and unbelievable this goes on in one of our main food industries of everyday life.
Corona is fine
Just got done with a workers comp case and man I got literally 1/20 of my injury has cost me out of pocket. Companies are cheap and should be held to a higher standard for sure! (Not meatplant worker, Truck driver coincidentally picking up at Purdue farms when injured)
don't all workers wear masks, goggles, gloves, etc why did the virus spread so much?
I stopped buying meat after I finally learned the tricks of how to make really good plant-based meat alternatives (like seitan chicken, wheat bacon, TVP burgers, etc). I'm not even vegetarian, but the food tastes great, my family likes it, the ingredients are usually shelf-stable, they're less expensive than real meat, and I at least know I'm not helping to support a disgusting and corrupt meat industry.
Only John can make me get pissed at meatpacking.
Go vegan for the welfare of people, if for no other reason. 💚😥 There is no stronger message you can send an industry than to stop giving them your time, attention, and money.
I don’t get why they don’t just replace the employees with robots. I mean it’s just repetitive movement.
Stop eating animals.
*I AM YOUR BIGGEST HATER JOHN OLIVER*
Do you think the show used to be funnier? Maybe it's harder without a live audience.
*podpiska koment laike*
And another thing they do to keep you from reporting injuries is purposefully employ junkies and other drug users and then threaten to drug test them if you try to report an injury
Ah liberals, full of hate envy and resentment.
You're losing your edge Oliver
I think I got the real problem. It is the letter "T". The german aquivalent to Tyson is called "Tönnies". Same stories, same problems. We should ban names with the letter T!
Charles Dickens would find all this very familiar...
Smithfield Foods was a big player in this issue, my local town had the largest outbreak in the state for the entire year solely due to our plant housing an utterly enormous amount of our minority population in the city. Give them makeshift and unregulated masks, lie about ventilation (their air conditioning/vents were not functioning properly), then put them back together less than a foot apart. It really is easy to run a business when your employees are not fluent with your language, right? There needs to be a new Accroaching-Hitler law.
The onerous kite roughly cheer because tooth extragingivally twist after a sordid continent. uninterested, rainy hood
Money is the only thing that matters to the CEOs. Stop eating meat, stop funding these exploitative assholes. Even if you don't care about the animals, you should care about the people.
Let me tell you why: because in this country, corporations are the real ones in-charge, they decide who are the government officials including the highest office. shouldn't expect anyone's pet to regulate their owners.
Yet another Last Week Tonight that makes me glad to be vegan. That's two in a row!
its just one of the extremes, we have here in europe as well but as one manager here stated, if they make it safer and/or pay workers better, they wont meet their revenue growth targets, when ask about those, he explained they are set to satisfy the shareholders. in other words, as long as managers are more afraid of explaining things to shareholders than anything, nothing is going to change.
Why is everyone so goddamned offended by everything these days?! I bet all the people who made the covid bets at the Tyson plant were all long time friends and co-workers and they all probably thought none of them would have any serious complications if they got it. No doubt this bet/pool was done in anything but the light of fun.  And people who are completely unaffected by it are going to get all butt hurt. Please, humanity is circling the shitter for sure.
There's a very good Richard Linklater movie about this called 'Fast Food Nation'. It was made in 2006...
Oliver is an expert at "Meat Packing".
Hm... just in general, why is it legal to sign away your rights? There is no good reason for this to be possible. Its only use is abuse.
That exercise video rubbed salt on the wounds,great directing
Smithfield meats is also awful, people would get sick, test positive for COVID-19 and then come back less than a week later, the work conditions are awful, the area for about a mile around the plant smells so good awful that it’s a surprise it hasn’t been shut down, there’s no communication at all between anyone. This is all at their main plant in Smithfield, Va. I’m speaking from personal experience and anecdotal evidence from my old coworkers
The US is morally bankrupt. I don’t get why people keep voting for politicians who want to perpetuate this situation. I’m glad I’m living in socialist Europe. Won’t claim everything is fine over here, but at least we’re taking human dignity a bit more serious.
Im just glad he doesnt talk about Trump every show anymore
Bet you didnt notice that he sits at a glass table
who is Judy Dench?
John Oliver should mention the connections to capitalism, wage labour and the profit motiv more. It's like he always has great analysis about the facts and backgrounds of attrocious conditions in america, but then fails to find the obvious link.
001 American People do your RESEARCH.   Be objective and listen to all News and all other platforms.  You will see the truth.  Wake up Americans!!!  I believed in Democrat, then I started doing my own Research because the main News Media, I noticed they were lying repeating the same stuff to push the narrative and agendas.  Talk is cheap,  Research and correct knowledge is priceless.  I was born into a Democratic family I choose now as an Adult and My Own Person.  AMERICA AND AMERICANS FIRST!!!🇨🇱🇺🇸👍
It's good to know that John has put his big nose into our food
That's an amazing segment...but to change the subject completely,  I miss his checkers shirts☺
Go Vegan
Who tryna pack my meat? Yah!!!!       Sorry continue with what you where doing
https://youtu.be/OxynOVrtevk
Vegan 9 years to hell with the lot of them.
OMG!!! This story makes me sick.  I feel like the luckiest person not working at a meat plant.
_Twenty years ago_ "Fast Food Nation" showed the same problems.  _Nothing_ has changed, in fact, it's probably got worse.  The US food processing industry is an embarrassment.
Thanks for not talking about how dems promised 2000 dollars and then went down to 1'400 as soon as they won Georgia.  Thanks for not talking about how the Biden administration continues to work towards a coup in Venezuela. Thanks for not talking about how they are in fact not stopping america's aid to the crimes of Saudi arabia in Yemen.

Synthetic meat for all!

Every day we realize how white privilege is engrained in our society. White people working corporate and office jobs meanwhile the colored people get exploited.
Powerful, as always.
And you, John, not so long ago became a citizen of that country! LOL
ah, now the show is back to talking about stuff no one cares about. good to see a return to normality
Not funny. John Oliver is almost worse than the South African who's name is escaping me.
Oh yeah i forgot to mention that i was slamming heroin everyday and nobody gave a fuck the i was cutting slippery pork on a band saw at break neck speeds.  That would include the usda inspector and plant mngr.
Usually I watch this from the other side of the Atlantic and think, "Well, that's America for you". However the Covid crisis uncovered some heavy shit in Germany regarding meatpackers as well: they're being imported from Eastern Europe, housed nearly as inhumane as the the animals they disjoint and unsurprisingly this was one of the first hotspots, then again and again. Because the owners of that company is best buddies with the minister president of that federal state. And we need our cheap BBQ meat, that is a human right and hence more important than the human rights of workers that aren't even German.
I'm not surprised about hearing shit like this. Is that ok???
Welcome to America 🇺🇸  Where MONEY 💰 rules and only if you are rich, you are truly blessed 😂
The Greeley JBS meet packing plant has always been the most dangerous place to work in that town. Everyone knows it but it's one of Greeley's main sources of revenue and production so officials turn their eyes away from all the violations agents humanity there. I have had family who worked in the plant it has always been terrible. I trained to work at rhe plant for two weeks and as soon as I had a job offer else where I quit.
How can anyone expect that workers get better treatment than the “treatment” of the animals on the conveyor belt?
Fun fact about meatpacking : The word "short" is longer than word "long"
Clicking on this video like "Yes, John, please ruin my day!" :D
When a company keeps saying they are a family RUN. I hope those workers get justice.
"I consider our workers like family" is BS-Speak for "I want to look good on TV, watch me act like I give a sh!t about these peons".   Also: Yes, Dame Judi is the epitome of talent and class, wrapped up in a glittering mist of awesome that we can only aspire to. Well done, John. ^5
If John Oliver and others like him and before stop reporting this shit, I will lose hope
Now who is going to call them out for their human rights violations? They police the world now who will police them?
Interesting to see that you have exactly the same problems as us in Germany.
Cannot get over how the people in the meatpacking icon are dressed like eggs ...
Holy shit, OSHA needs to have some sharp and deadly fangs to deal with this crap.

4:16 he says that's fast . Where I work they hang anywhere from 60-90 a minute by themselves.   Absurd
Do not like meat industry? What you can do is use less meat, and the industry will feel every bit of it. Just to remind: 1) A good portion of cooked meat is about 80g/meal, to target to ~20g of protein per meal. 2) Avoid processed red meat. If possible, eat red meat/red meat products 700g/week (500g cooked) or less to lower your chance of intestinal cancer. 3) If you feel adventurous, try out vegan protein sources for fun on some of your meals! There's a good chance there are good ready to use beans, seitan (wheat protein) or bean products at your well equipped food markets that you'll like! If you need help, join a (unhealthy- , if possible :D ) vegan food oriented facebook group and ask/seek there (tell you want easy and quick to use alternatives for meat, or search the group to find these)! Use the enthusiasm of the vegans to help you!
Repeat this wonderful and magical mantra: F*** capitalism. F*** corporate greed.
This is one of the less worrying things happening in the world tbh compared to most of the other subject matters that John Oliver covers 🧐
If employees in the trenches for the average Fortune 500 knew the kind of stuff that went down at corporate HQs they would shit a brick.  One particular healthcare company I worked at used to let us off for half a day on Fridays (after I left they gave corporate employees unlimited PTO) and would essentially give us unlimited bar tabs through the company itself and/or vendors once a month or so while nurses and doctors were deep in the shit (literally sometimes).
All hail capitalism! It is the American nightmare for those meat factory workers. I don't know how many people will boycott or at the very least cut down meat consumption just to show these overlords that the american people have dignity and should be respected and treated well.
Let's see - human suffering. Okay.   1. All over the world, but especially in places like Africa, most of the land and water is used to feed animals, not people. The animals are sold to wealthy Africans or exported to Europe. Children starve to death so that you can have a burger. You can stop contributing to this suffering by going vegan.   2. Anyone who lives near a factory farm or a feed lot will tell you that the stench is unbearable, it pollutes the air and the water, and is a leading killer in those communities. You can stop contributing to this by going vegan.   3. Low-wage factory-farm and slaughterhouse workers would not be working in those places if we, the consumers, didn't buy their cruel product. If we stop eating animal products, the industries will simply make something else, like pea or soy protein for meat alternatives. Ask someone who works on the factory floor of Impossible Foods or Beyond Meat if they prefer their job to working for Tyson. If you want to stop contributing to this suffering, you can do so by going vegan.   4. Almost all viruses, like Covid 19, bird flu, swine flu, etc, are zoonotic - which means they jump from animals to humans. What's more, 80% of antibiotics are given to farmed animals, not to people - leading to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These viruses and bacteria kill millions of healthy humans every year. If you want to stop contributing to this, go vegan.   This is to say nothing of the fact that animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of all of the following - deforestation, ocean dead zones, greenhouse gases, water pollution, desertification, land usage, water usage.   Finally, even if all of the above weren't true - killing animals in any manner is abhorrent (some more so than others) - whether by shooting one with a rifle or snapping its neck in your back yard or slitting its throat in a slaughterhouse. When we see roadkill, we recoil. When we accidentally run over a cat, we feel like shit. If someone showed your kids where their chicken nuggets and bacon and eggs came from, the child would be traumatized and you would be upset at the person who showed it to them, rather than at yourself for paying for it to happen and feeding it to your kids.   Tell me again about HUMAN suffering?  You've got it all backwards - veganism is simply a return to doing what's right; leaving animals and nature alone. We can survive and thrive on locally-sourced produce.
Corporate bonuses need to be abolished, they only encourage the cutting of corners so the people up top and the shareholders profit at the expense of the actual workers. This is why they're so afraid of socialism, god forbid you even slightly bridge the monumental gap between your average worker and someone in an office miles away telling them what they already know.
This is shameful but doesn't surprise me big corporations in general are evil and are ran by pieces of shit honestly you'd be better off and more moral being a criminal and that shouldn't be true
The american dream turned out to be a pipe dream. I am shocked! I hate the bureaucratic nightmare that is germany but always say to myself, "It could be worse, it could be like in america".
The capricious plaster neurally sin because bush successfully hand alongside a free icicle. quack, delirious scale
Missed a perfect opportunity to say "porkhub"
I worked for 2 years at a Sanderson Farms production plant before COVID hit, I quit because they took literally 0 precautions when the virus hit. We had a meeting right when the pandemic started and they essentially told us that if we left the city for any reason we had to report it to them and that then we would be permanently suspended without pay until we received a negative COVID test. I quit the next day because I knew that all they did was ensure that no one would tell them if they left the city or they were sick because we're all broke fucks who need our jobs. Sad part is that I haven't been able to find a job throughout the last year so next month, I'll probably end up reapplying and going right back. To address the "quota" problem, Sanderson farms required me to hang 33 chicken thighs every minute. The quotas for the guys who worked on the full bird hang lines were much higher and was a lot more taxing. I had to cover up there 1 shift and couldn't do it for 4 hours, much less 8-12. Injuries: I injured my knee on the job and they refused to send me for the doctor or send me home for a couple of weeks. It took 2 months of me working full shifts while barely being able to walk until they finally scheduled me an MRI, they had stalled for so long that the MRI tech said there was "evidence of a recent severe MCL sprain". They stalled so long that it had already healed, even though I was continuously putting weight on it, causing more damage and pain. Also, John is right when they say they prey on groups that have to work for them. Most of my coworkers were 1 of 2 people. Either ex-cons who couldn't find full-time work anywhere else, or Mexican immigrants who were here on VISAs. Luckily, I'm not in either group so I could (and did) leave when things got bad but most of my coworkers have no other options. He's also right about OSHA. Inspectors give advanced warning for when they are showing up so we'll be told a few days before and we will have to deep clean the factory and they'll slow the lines down to make it look like we're working at a safe pace. Worst part is that right after they leave, they crank the lines up and overwork the shit out of us to make up for the lost time.
I guess meat is back on the menu
As native Texan, I've experienced our horrid worker's comp laws. It's been terrible for decades, and has only gotten worse.
Check out Gagne Foods in Bath, Maine... I found a joint in the dough hopper at one point. A plastic scrapper that had been grinded down by an industrial shredder that had a drug addict for an operator. Had a to take a guy out from under a nitrogen chill tunnel who "felt dizzy" underneath three feet of nitrogen gas. Almost lost an arm to three machines with guards that had no safety switches. No NDA. No issues with admitting to this. Thank God no one died.
Americans have been taught that if they hear the word freedom enough, it doesn't matter if someone is fucking them in the ass but doesn't get them off. Capitalism works just fine, not for the majority though.
A company claiming it was a family could also be translated into: "So we`ra a big family. And me (the owner) are the old grandpa on top of fucking everything. So commit your fucking lifes to support me without me giving you anything back. Besides of bad stories about family bonds while you`re wipping my ass.
as an European watching this *facepalm* then "I guess I understand their need to bleach their chicken meat..."
USA you need some hard-hitting Unions
This guy is the most depressing person.all he does is bitch and complain
It's a larger problem with working, period.
Take away the demand by going plant-based. We each have personal responsibility as to the consumer choices we make. These places wouldn’t exist if we simply didn’t buy their cruel product. That’s the lesson we refuse to learn.
Quick note to the head of Tyson, people don’t negligently attempt to kill their “family” Meat packing plants are one of the best reason to go vegetarian.  These poor workers need to work for a better employer.
Bill Maher had a better take on this - and a more realistic solution than just "tax them more", "regulate them more", "make conditions safer". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OoT2OZWCOI
Germany has similar problems with their local meat packing industry regarding Corona.
SIN TABU NO HAY MORAL
only left wing youtube would put a hack like john oliver  on  try being balance that would be a start
We should do only one thing: stop eating meat, or drastically reduce it, at most once a month
America is disgusting how can you people possibly think you are the greatest country on earth
I disagree on the assets. If your biggest asset isn't your own brain, you did mess up your education.
“We don’t need ubi just get off your lazy ass and get a job” yeah fucken right .
Wow. I think that the quality of your comedy is suffering now that you're not screaming "Orange Man Bad!". There is a new guy in the White House and he has EVEN MORE DIRT ON HIM. You can always scream "Pedo Man Bad!" and likely reuse a lot of your dated material.
If you eat meat you are directly responsible for the deforestation of the Amazon. Sweet dreams
go vegan.
"customer safety is our top priority" "our workers are our number one asset" since there's no law against lying, it's free for every company to say it, and say it they do. usually after people die. i guess i'm just so jaded that hearing it sounds hollow and a bit insulting to me.
Why isn't this process automated yet?
So glad that this doesn’t involve Trump
I guess you could say the betting pool....is a deadpool?
yup, I think it's time to give up meat. It's literally killing people too.
This is so fucked
The glorious wonders of under-regulated capitalism never cease to amaze!
Did he already do an episode on hedge funds? Figured the GameStop Robinhood inquiry would be this week's worth.
I love capitalism
In another episode of "USA is a third world country just wearing a Gucci belt"
Would've been interesting if ya didn't have the whole segment center around the gross sociopathic disregard for decency, safety, and legality that will always be at the heart of poultry food production in America,evil enabled by oversight weakness, only to wrap things up by suggesting the system isn't working as designed when in fact THIS IS EXACTLY HOW IT WAS MADE FOR. This is you: 🤡"The ppl doing bad ought to be made to do good instead of doing bad cause it's rules, rule keepers, and fear of losing money that will keep them in line."  INSTEAD, maybe you could find some rich people to go buy that chicken plant. It's equally as helpful as your idea.  OR Doing something cruel and funny to these cruel and unfunny ppl. I'm sure there are plenty of absurd laws or lack of in Texas that would allow a wealthy man like yourself or someone you know to make that family's life miserable.  OR  you can donate lots of money or better yet supply the service by proxy for the workers and families to get real justice. Then encourage us, their fellow restless filth, to responsibly begin the calculated consumer divestment of Tyson chicken. Maybe even in a way that would make viewers some cash. I heard that GameStop guy made 48million WTF
More reasons not to eat meat ever egain
Sadly enough, this "trend" has also come to Europe. Not that it wasn't bad enough before...
Perdu chicken 🐔 bad Purdue pharma 💊 bad
That is some Uptown Sinclair bullshit. Hard to believe that the US is back to 19th century labor standards.
animals are not commodities. go vegan :)
He’s fuckn hilarious 😂
im not going to eat bugs, commie. the food supply continues as usual. 8/1500 is not that many.
Land of the "free"
Every time I watch this show I wish the president would watch it too and use that education to make the serious changes we need in this country.
Why did this disgraceful story have to appear in a comedy show  hosted by a comedian?
Never read Upton Sinclair's THE JUNGLE, didja, boyo?
We live in the best country, so really what does that say about the rest of the global? Those things don’t even make it into the news. Like this video (I agree with it BUT) is complaining about people that have jobs and that we have chickens to feed our citizens. So really we have food and jobs, do they need to get better? Yes of course all can always get better but these are first world problems!
Truly loved your show.  Before you Turned Trump into Joke but if your not An American you will never understand.
Cryptocurrency is here to stay, if you can't see that at this point, it's time to learn about it and venture into it
John Oliver nails it with surgical precision, thank you John for your reporting about what is really going on around us. You are not just a diamond in the rough but a gem, and a treasure.
Oooh, I'll try asking the police to put a box over their head the next time I see them. "Sure, here's my driver's license, but don't look in the backseat"
"What can we do about it?"  ...We could form a union and go on strike. Not gonna mention unionization, John? Hmm... Never even occurred to you that's an option, huh?
I'm only one consumer. But at least as far as JB is concerned, my family will no longer buy any of their products. And we will write to them and tell them why. After I write my legislators and have a word with them. Anyone else?
John always reminds us of the worst parts of Capitalism
Sign this waiver with your teeth, but if your signature differs a tiny bit *in some rando's eyes* your voting ballot will be thrown out.
Last week tonight claims the workers are denied bathroom breaks without indicating how long they have to work before they can do that which can be 1.5 hours (You can be sure they left out this information intentionally). John Oliver's solutions are more social distancing (decrease workers), slower belt(decrease production) and raising Minimum wage(which has been proven to kill any industry its implemented). How much do you wanna bet its because they wanna kill the meat industry?
Maybe stop eating dead animals...
A plant based diet is healthy and delicious. Why support this criminal industry?
why does america hate workers?
Good shit, sir. Good shit. It shouldn't be just the corporate headass's who have the ability to go to a class to increase their health... these companies, which, are forcing people to sign documents WITH THEIR TEETH WHEN THEIR HURT, WTF, should pay for their "family" to be well. Especially, when the company is making BILLIONS, and "values" their employees other than an asset. I'm no politician or lawyer, but WTH politicians & lawyers! Where's your 'tegrity??? Money shouldn't be more important, especially if it was someone that you knew! How do all of you argue for 'MERICA... but then don't support America, other than the plebs putting money into your pockets? Where's the ethics? Oh yeah, in those blank check and lobbyists who "don't" manipulate. ******* sad.
How do they get away with this? Because the workers don't have a union. It's way past time for the union militancy to make a re-emergence in this country.
Unions are most likely the answer
The family hamster has rabies and has bitten his wife, kids, and the dog and he asks "What's for dinner?" Divorce papers, obviously.
I’d swipe right on you John!
I love his classy British Accent 😍
I really like these kind of videos that Joh Oliver has been doing for such a long time. I do kind of feel that in America stories like these don't really matter and nothing changes. As Donald Trump has clearly shown the world, you can pretty much just do whatever you want in America as long as you have money and/or have political backings. I'm from Europa so feel free to tell me if I'm wrong though, but there's just so many scandelous stories from America that blow my mind. And nothing seems to change, it seems to only be getting worse.
So... Union anyone?
first of all: do not buy cheap meat.
There was news from Russia of finding a new strain of bird flu influenza virus in humans just last week. I wonder how much more death and devastation it's going to take for us to collectively get the message through our thick fucking skulls and change our ways.
Hot take: Families don't take bets on who's gonna get Covid
But my tendies!
This is exactly why i voted for bernie. i'm tried of this shit and he was only damn person talking about the worker.
I'm afraid to watch this😳
Finally, a journalist story not involving trump related topics. Or making the storing about him.   Welcome back pre-2016 John Oliver!
0bjbjjhjjiüü
Meatpacking seems to be a fun job all over the world. Some of the biggest Covid outbreaks over here in Germany happened in meatpacking factories. And the workers are often from eastern Europe working for minimum wages.
In Germany there were several major Covid-19 outbreaks in Meat packing plants, where thousands were infected. It also exposed the terrible conditions the workers have to work under.
LWT: it's time to improve their working environment. Tyson: no, it's time to go fully automatic
As a fellow worker in the production industry I 1000% agree that something needs to be done for Factory working conditions as a whole because of the various bodily damages due to those repetitive motions. Companies also skimp out on machinery alongside workers.
How about... i know this is quite wild, but: Maybe not buy meat and eat something else instead? better for everybody. And just look at that disgusting chicken boss, why support blatant assholes like that guy? As long as people pay for these crimes to happen to people and animals we will never make it out of the dark age (which we all still live in, don't be fooled)
we have 1920s levels workers abuse right now and no strong unions taking the lead in nationally to make this shit aware.
Joe Biden needs to come to the rescue with his policy of “I am not Trump.” Oh wait, he opposes a 15 dollar minimum wage, is opposed to a medicare for all, and lied to people about their COVID-19 relief checks, sends more troops to war.  He could care less about the workers or working class.  His nomination of Neera Tanden as budget chief, really shows he cares with her past history of pushing for anti working class policies.  Well you get what you voted for.
If you had seen, “Food, inc.” to add clip to, omg !
Under Trump regime, if ever re-elected, these meat packers jobs would be moved to inmates duty. « Rehabilitation in slavery » for profits ! Hopefully enough, Trump will soon have to print car number plates at 30 cents an hour ...
Damn.
The hell is this ad??! What is wrong with you America?! xD
The US has a proud history of slavery...
Another reason to go vegan...besides the treatment of workers, the suffering of animals on factory farms, and your own health.
My dad worked for this company many years. He sliced up his right thumb while working and now his thumb has no nail.
shut up
The whole industry of mass-produced meat is depraved and rotten to the core. People should stop saying stuff like "vegetarians care more about animals than the farm workers that pick vegetables" and take a look at how the meat industry treats its workers. We cannot call ourselves civilized when we treat people (or animals) as disposable. If everyone could reduce their consumption of meat even a little it would make a big impact.
Lol it's funny how targeting the meatpacking industry would solve so many other problems at the same time.
This is why Europe is so much better than USA.
Go watch my videos 💯
Capitalism.
That's a damn quiet video
USA leader of fourth world
The « nurse » job’s is to check bird’s injuries. No the « slaves » paid  chicken wages !
Just insane !
Hm 3500 $ you can do it wife it you only need a asshole and a Court to go wife it.  50000 worker 10 safty breaks to 3500 eatch are 1.75 bil$ that can make by it is the USA only fore finds
57543, so... Who won the pool?
America is so fucked up 😂
fuck it let's go vegan
what do you expect from companies whos entire business is built on exploitation, murder and some of the most horrific acts committed against nature
Just saying, we use the immersion blender that you exemplified for making ranch
OSHA should be able to fine full percentage points of profits.  Imagine a 50bil company having to pay OSHA a 150mil fine per violation.  Corporate fines to need to be so horrible that deliberate acts like these plants do run the risk of seriously impacting the share price.  Execs will never listen to regulations even when they do exist, But crush their stock price with severely profit impacting fines and you can bet the shareholders will take notice and put the clamps on the C-Level execs to make their company safer.  Go one better, if a company pays dividends the government puts a lean on the dividends account until all safety violations are repaired and verified and the fines paid off.  Meaning until they resolve the issues and pay off their fines they cannot pay out dividends.
MEat faktorys, it is like a maifia are running that!
This one the end of eating meat to me:(
A whole episode about meat packing plants and not one mention of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle? That book came out 114 f*cking years ago and caused the government to create the FDA. And have things gotten better since then? Not really.
Shitty country. Refugees welcome in Europe yo
Capitalism is great, isn't it?
fun that all these industries are this way because we are all sinning on Gluttony. and im no believer before you start throwing any jabs that way. i fucks with Satan he was the only angel with an opinion and god ditched him. Did i de-rail? Yes or yes.
Stop eating animals
I doubt a significant amount are asian, but I could be wrong
Honestly, there's absolutely zero redeeming qualities of the whole meat industry. The animals suffer, the people suffer, the planet suffers, it's inefficient as fuck from a pure energy standpoint (calories produces with the amount it takes to produce them). The only thing you could argue is taste and that is very subjective and also prone to change depending on what it is you're eating. It baffles me as a species we allow a few billionaires to fuck EVERYTHING over. Fun times.
wow 30 years without a sick day in that conditions is just fkn amazing!:o I'd hire the fck out off that guy. Doesn't matter the job. shame he died.
I know everything else you said Is infinitely more important , but; _<"Robot-fuck a soup">_ Damnit John... Now I'll have that in my head everytime I use my immersion blender  -_-
Another solution: We simply stop buying their products...
One More Reason why its Good That us-Meat is Not allowed in the EU. The Standards are so much lower. Mindblowing.
This video made me 1000% happier that I do the majority of my own meat processing.
I have buddies who worked in bubba burger in Elberton, ga and a chicken packing plant in hall county ga.... They confirmed ppl are so miserable they take their anger out on animals, even throwing live chickens against walls
Go vegan
Getting any significant improvement on this situation will altimitaly lead to one thing which is higher price of meats for the consumer. There is no way for the capitalists to cut their profit for goods, money will always come from one source to the other, but never from the capitalist’s pocket.
The  fretful crocodile reversely confess because half-brother fittingly sip throughout a relieved hen. holistic, soft pamphlet
I thought Americans love their Freedom so much. They dont Even have the Freedom to go to their doctor of Choice without their employer threatening to Fire them... like wtf.
as awful as all of this is it is in no way limited to meatpacking plant i worked at roper corporation for over a year and a large portion of my towns population  has also works there and every single one of the terrible  practices explained in this video also occur there from the cramped working conditions and repetitive movement injuries to the useless first ad offered on site and i sure if anyone care enough to look in to it and interview the employees they would find horror story after horror story
The Jungle
If we don’t see how this relates to every single pandemic, the current pandemic and the next one, humanity’s excessive meat consuming behavior, and our relationship to the animals and the planet... human suffering.. animal suffering... if we don’t see this, there is no hope. I rest my case.
I think I'll start buying from my local butcher shop from now on.
Realistically what DO “WE” do?! I support my local livestock farms and local butcher with my business. If everybody did that then these meatfactory workers would be jobless.   The people who actually do eat Tyson and Purdue meats I’m sure think it’s too expensive already- do they have an income that could cover paying the price the product would command were the factories being run in a humane way?   This is capitalism. Someone has to be being shit on.
imagine if we had a president who watched last week tonight like trump watched fox.  just imagine
I'm convinced America is just one giant experiment at this point..
Sounds exactly like Amazon
i hope aliens land and farm us and then call us family!
The unequaled velvet karyologically clear because hot histomorphometrically influence underneath a complex honey. overconfident, irate car
This show keeps showing episode after episode of the horrors of absolute capitalism. Why don't you guys get it, capitalism is an outdated system that needs to be replaced. What do you expect would happen?
Shame US!!
Such a nice corporatocracy you got there. What a shithole.
7:20 what is that joke?
Osha needs people, people need jobs, MAKE IT HAPPEN FUCK YOU, HIRE ME!
I love john and this show but this is a topic that im going to take the ignorance is bliss route. Literally don’t have the bandwidth to know how shitty all my food is or how terrible the conditions are that it comes from. Just cba...
Talking in a Super aggressive Tempo makes it clear how Hostile you are.. and you aren't explaining anything except your own idiot ignorance to the real life and environment normal Americans have to deal with..
I'm like 2:30 in to this video... and I don't know if I want to watch the rest of it... Because I like eating chicken tendies.
Oh cool, so we're just doing The Jungle all over again. Cool cool cool cool cool
This show should be renamed "Let's see how fucked up America is" with John Oliver #lshfuai
13:11 if you eat their chicken are you going to look like their employees?
Just can't wait to see all the pandering the companies do to save their asses. They're allowed to run a business, but they should have to run it the right way. These are human beings we're dealing with. And if any of them are pro-lifers, then it's just simply ironic 🤦🏻‍♂️
“”When I wrote The Jungle I was aiming for the public’s heart, and instead I hit its stomach.” —Upton Sinclair
why are they showing beef when talking about poultry workers?  I know it's not really important to the issues discussed but still
This is a Capitalist country , yes we're not perfect ( no country is , remember ) , but if John ( or whoever that ) hates America this much , why doesn't he get out ?
Yet another reason to become a vegetarian
Looks like Upton Sinclair's 'The Jungle' is still relevant today...
as a member of the front range, we all hate Greeley & Weld Co.
It's a sad fact that these  plants DO consider their workers family. After all your family will screw you far faster than your friends ever will....
When will people stop eating meat already? It's bad on every level, the only thing it satisfies is personal desire and smart post-war marketing to be a luxury to be had on a daily basis. Instead of trying to change an entire system, a simple choice will create change by itself.
fraction of a fuck   , dam coffee thu the nose on that  LOL
Kicken chicken 👍
didnt realize being a meatpacker was just like working for amazon
https://youtu.be/Xk1qlOx5rzc
HA!! You are literally marinating in the success of FULLBLOWN CAPITALISM  👉🤯💨.  And NO, the alternative doesn't have to be communism. There is more than fifty shades of hurray.
Animals and workers exploitation are one single thing coming from the same origin
Simple solution: don’t buy meat. Good for the animal, the environment and those workers.
Yup, this is the last straw, I'm going to try and be vegan.
I don't believe in pushing my beliefs on anyone, and I won't put up with it from anyone else, but I just want to say I stopped eating meat of any kind in 1967 and I am just fine, and a lot better off than most.  I still think it was a good move.
People please wake the f"ck up since the problem is obviously capitalism
Yet these same ppl love trump and think that he is a god send and that he loves them and is gonna somehow save them or something. I’m sure he gives a shit about you idiots obviously I don’t mean everyone but the amount of ppl I’ve seen white black Hispanic Asian they all think that he is getting them their jobs back though
honestly, just automated this. Spend money on artificially intelligence and machine learning.
*HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU HAVE?*  How much more time do you have left to spend in this world? I have heard people say "Life is Short" and its TRUE. Regardless of your age, You should always remember that "VERY SOON, YOU WILL BE HERE NO MORE" Nobody lives in this world Forever. THE MAJOR QUESTION IS, WHERE WILL YOU SPEND ETERNITY?  YOU may not Believe in Eternity or Life After Death but, THAT DOES NOT CHANGE THE REALITY, YOU WILL BE THERE VERY SOON. PLEASE BE WISE, NOT BELIEVING BRINGS SEVERE HARM TO YOUR LIFE BECAUSE, YOU ARE IN CONFLICT WITH THE GOD YOU CANNOT DEFEAT, HE IS GOD, FEAR HIM.  The word of GOD says, in Hebrew 9:27 AND IT IS APPOINTED UNTO MEN TO DIE ONCE, BUT AFTER THIS IS JUDGMENT.  All men from all nation will face the judgment of God after Death. THE GOOD NEW IS THAT GOD HAS GIVEN ALL MEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN MERCY, FORGIVENESS OF SINS AND ETERNAL REST AFTER DEATH ON EARTH. THIS HOPE IS IN JESUS CHRIST. He was CRUCIFIED, He dies to save HUMANITY FROM ETERNAL DESTRUCTION, HE BEARED THE WAGES OF OUR SINS, HE LAID DOWN HIS LIFE TO SAVE ALL MEN, HE TOOK THE PUNISHMENT OF OUR SINS UPON HIMSELF AND HE DIED ON THE CROSS. IF YOU REJECT JESUS CHRIST, YOU ARE REJECTING GOD'S MERCY, AND YOU ARE LEFT WITH THE OPTION OF ETERNAL DAMNATION. THE CHOICE IS YOURS.  The word of God says, in Romans 6:23 FOR THE WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH, BUT THE GIFT OF GOD IS ETERNAL LIFE THROUGH JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD.  ARE YOU ABLE TO BEAR THE WAGES OF YOUR SINS? WILL YOU NOT RATHER REPENT AND BE FORGIVEN? WILL YOU NOT ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AND BE SAVED?  I PERSUADE YOU TO CHOOSE WISELY, RELIGION WILL NOT SAVE YOU, ALL MEN NEEDS JESUS CHRIST. ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST TODAY AND BE SAVED.  Kindly Say the following prayer: "Lord Jesus Christ, Have mercy on me, I'm a sinner,  forgive me my sins, Cleanse me from my iniquities, I believe You died for me, And today, I forsake all my sin,  I forsake devil and the world, I enter into the kingdom God, In Jesus name Amen".

Putting .00003% in perspective. If you make $30,000 a year, the fine would be $0.90.
I have relatives that have permanent injuries from this repetitive motion bullshit. Same goes for Amazon. The only real answer unfortunately is full automation and the loss of these jobs.
Ford conveyor belt system
Ford conveyor belt system
Whenever I hear about how corporates function in America it makes me feel really blessed that I was born elsewhere where people actually considers the value of peers lol
America really learned fuck all from The Jungle. Exact same shit that went down in 1906 is still happening today.
Fun fact: You have Tyson we have Tönnies
I heard ordering meat from Butcher Box would be better.   Has anyone heard otherwise?  https://www.butcherbox.com/
George Zimmerman is innocent John, he killed Trayvon in self defense plain and simple.
Say with me everybody: U N I O N I Z E !
Fining JBS $15,000 for what is more or less manslaughter, wow... 0.00003% of their annual profit. Based on my income, that's the equivalent of slapping me with a fine for 14 cents. No wonder they don't give a damn.
Why do some people become psychopaths once they get promoted to a managerial position? It's not like the plant managers are owners or have a substantial stake in the company - why so loyal to the company with zero empathy for the workers? Fuck, if it was me as the manager...I would assume the company would one day treat me the same shitty way it is treating the rest and get the hell out.
See, due to not being British, I actually rank family as third on that list and enjoy our time together. Fourth is the splendidly monstrous Helen Mirren, and only at the five-spot do I get  around to acknowledging the magnificence of Dame Judi Dench.  Yeah, she goes down TWO spots.
The way workers are still treated is just one reason the #birthrate will continue to fall. There's no point in women sacrificing their own and their kids' lives to this meat grinding system that will always treat humanity as trash.
Fuck off with you immersion blender analogy. I’ve used and abused mine regularly for the past six years and it’s barely holding together.
Factories treat machines better than humans. If machine breaks, fix machine. If human breaks get new human.
I worked at a pork plant in Illinois. It was horrible.
america is such a cesspool
Worked at Tyson for a year..... quit, got a ged, a bachelors, and a masters. Place was hell
You forgot 2 more things we should do: mass organization of meat packing workers to demand proper compensation for their labor and boycotting the companies responsible.
Boycott meat. Divest from meat companies. Sanction meat companies. Go Vegan.
This video makes me feel I am so spoilt. I am not, this is just horrible.
this is why our forefather fought for unions to represent the worker but some how we don't need unions you can represent your self good luck on that.
I too have issues packing my meat!
LastWeekTonight posts a video.  Me: *[Depressed and more than a little angry]* "Alright, how has this sad, spinning rock we call 'Earth' let me down this time?"
I had to smoke a cigarette after this as if I worked all day and didn't get one.
Again and again being happy not to live in the US
why does all his videos start as if he was mid conversation about something else
America truly is a sh**hole country!
I hope there will be justice for these workers :/
Everyone seems to run to this country thinking it'll be better. Where do we run to?
So tired of hearing people with huge platforms talk about the issues surrounding factory farming EXCEPT for the welfare of the animals because "a lot of people already talk about that". Clearly not enough of them do! SMH
Probably worth mentioning by the way that another reason companies like these get away with untenable work environments is because of how hard they have fought against workers unions for the better part of the last century.
Grow and slaughter your own animals. Give them a species specific life where they get to fulfill them self. And the day you really need the meat, end their life fast and humanley, shed a few tears and take good care of their offspring and dont forget the sacrifice. Then butcher their carcass, leave as little as possible, most can be utilised. And then enjoy a feast whit your family.
This is great motivation to boycott
Try becoming vegetarian or eating less meat
Fuck them. Time to change, love and light ❤️✨🙏🏽🌈
Stop trying to raise the price of my 99-cent chicken nuggets, John.
Meatpacking, warehouses etc. Good ol boy old industries. The Jungle never ended.
Now do "Unemployment in Biden era", you epileptic mouse under the influence of benzodiazepines.
Cool, so another reason to only eat plant-based food
Tyson is a family where one kid is showered with love, compassion, money... The other child(ren) are shoved into the basement, left there to rot & are told every day how worthless they are, for as long as they are alive.
They only hire immigrants when they lose leg they just go home.

This what y'all pay for when you eat meat
In Belgium we have a funny story about the vegetarian animal-activist Jules Ruhl (who lived around 1900) who worked in the slaughterhouse of Anderlecht (part of Brussels) to know his "enemies" and was shocked not only because of the cruelty towards the animals but also because of the horrific working conditions of the butchers and decided to not only to help the animals but also the meat plant workers. They have raised via early crowdfunding money for his statue
Become Vegan, problem solved. Eating animal corpses is gross and the industry is corrupt!
Boycott!. Yes it can be expensive to be mindfull/selective consumers but at what human price are we over eating Chicken&Beef in our Diets. I understand not everyone wants to stay away from this consumption but surely we can begin to cut back. These companies have demonstrated Zero Care for the frontline employees.
Maybe OSHA inspectors can begin collaborating with the local PD to open criminal negligence investigations or work with a journalist looking to infiltrate the plant. Maybe an FDA inspector can be a witness. At this rate working with local personal injury attorneys would be more productive than actually going to the plant to try and do their job conventionally.
You know, Andrew Cuomo killed a bunch of a people. But it's cool if you wanna talk about meat. Thanks for all the strawman arguments against conservatives and consistently proving yourself to be a dishonest person.
i wonder how much of our meat has human
I’ve driven past Bo’s house many times heading to Pittsburg for peaches
He really should stop "talking with his hands"
This is what McConnel wanted to pass as part of the COVID 19 relief - a provision to hold the companies NOT liable for deaths caused as a result of them forcing workers to work in unsafe conditions .. but hey .. let's blame that on AOC too. Sometimes I feel like I live in a world of crazy people - because people like McConnel will be re-elected forever !!
What do u expect from a capitalist driven country named America. Of course profits is no 1, and their people?? They didn't even care, cos they've paid people's leader to make them shut up and willingly being used till their value is invalid. GREAT AMERICA.
Jimmy Carr is number 4, family is number 5
never buying or eating Tyson piss-covered chicken again!!!!
But what can we do to help? Boycott meat? Write letters? I do appreciate the light shed on this industry bit how to help is also important information. I feel so bad for them!
Thank you for covering this, John
Started watching, video not available, all hail feee VPN on phone
America has not only NOT abolished slavery, it greatly increased!
Anyone else think from the title this was going to be about the spread of STDs within a certain community...? ....  Don't be it... .... Ohhhhh, don't be a homophobe... I was speaking about brucellosis... you know, why we pasteurize milk.
This makes me sad
Stop consuming their products.
China owns meat processing plants in America. They run them like their camps. Abuse Latinos to process America meat , to send back to China?
simple solution. Stop eating meat.
PLEASE TALK ABOUT THE INDIA FARMERS PROTEST. The world's largest democracy is being threatened with internet shutdowns, journalists being jailed, unilateral laws that will put the food supply into the hands of a few greedy corporations.   How much will it cost to eat when there is a monopoly on FOOD?  This is a global human rights issue. Millions have been protesting for MONTHS. That level of protest does not happen without cause.  This matters, and the U.S. media is not discussing it at all. These protesters voices are being clamped in their own country. People are being jailed and charged with sedition for posting about it on Twitter, while pro Modi tweets are of course free to fly, giving the rest of the world a very one sided view of things.  PLEASE TALK ABOUT THIS.
I'm always a little disappointed in naked statistics like "283 meatpacking workers have died" from Covid. 1000 people are dying of Covid in the US every day from Covid, so how are we supposed to tell if that number is bad or not? Is it particularly high as a proportion of the population, relative to other professions? Give the people what they want, John: in-depth statistical analysis!!
No wonder turkey Mitch Mcconnell was so eager to include stritch limits to companies potential covid-19 liabilities regarding their workers in those rescue deals.  How any Americans not finding themselves among the elite and owners in society, choose to support the republicans who are so into theese kind of large companies pockets.... beyond me.  You sure have a great thing going on over there....
Once the laugh track is removed, you see how unfunny he really is.
10:51 I don't get it...Its Texas, that dosen't seem...thematically correct.
key take away: abolish wage slavery and unionize america
The plan to have us eating gmo food rather than "organic"...
our queen is back'
go vegan
that's crazy.. hard to watch. that bathroom though is hilarious, the color of a chicken breast
Yeah. How corporations treat their workers during the pandemic is bad, but I think that the Millennials and Zoomers splashing the term "Boomer Remover" all over social media might actually be worse.  It's hard to get on board with hating "Big Meat Packing" when our children don't even care if their parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles die while attached to a ventilator.
Oh thank god he didn’t include Adam Driver in the list of things that consider him meat.
summary: a 18 minute one sided video of every possible thing that makes tyson/poultry industry look bad in the last 30+ years, plus a little bit of race. next show: why pork/beef industry is bad ends with: buy plant based meat, because I have investments, like bill gates does.
This is American
Crippling arthritis lawsuits are coming to a town near you
What kinda creeps hit dislike...
Thank God since the epidemic I started to raise chickens and goats in my own farm. And it is so good
There goes another damn reason to go vegetarian/vegan
*Reality Meeting* *Meat plants CEOs:* let us replace humans with robotic arms, it is less headache *State Goverments:* Wait wait, some problems are okay sometimes, keep the people for tax reasons and less unemployment
How can it POSSIBLY be legal to fire someone for going to a doctor/reporting an ingury? There should clearly be better labour laws and these guys obviously need to UNIONIZE
Ahahhha... This guy is full of shit... People had some laughs in a bad situation.
John likes Packing Meat.
This is probably the darkest episode done by Oliver
And remember a lot of politicians push harder and harder for de-regulation.
Not all regulations are smart or good, especially if enacted by interests who want to stamp out potential competition through such kinds of regulations, but regulations on industries like this are absolutely necessary. Those who say they want to cut or gut regulations, ask, what kind of regulations do they want to gut and what is their interest in doing so? Then vote against the politicians who want to gut those regulations on workplace safety. Usually that will mean voting Democratic, but maybe always. Dems arent perfect, but better then Republicans on these issues
before i finish this video vegans have been saying how bad these conditions people are working in are
2.9 K people disliking this are soulless.
dont eat tyson products youll be fine without the shit nuggets and chemical fillled meat
Boycott Tyson!
Honestly, I love meat. Yum, yum, yum. What I love more, however, is workers' rights - all of which are being regularly violated by the meat industry. I don't love meat that much. Fuck the meat industry. I'm now a combative vegetarian.
oh my god how sad...... continues eating chicken nuggies.
The jokes don’t hit but the documentary is well done. Thank you oliver
Why is everyone in Tyson's little video overweight?
Heck them all! Stop eating animal corpse and none of those problem will exists
The icky hole optionally stroke because chain immuhistochemically scribble afore a elite baby. insidious, awesome page
are we just not gunna talk about the last few months before this man came back
I work in online warehouse, and yea work conditions are also horrible. lol. But at least I have a job, most people are unemployed because of covid. cant wait for covid to pass away so I can find a better job lol.
😂😅😆😂😅😆😅😂
what the hell.... family is number one....
it shouldn't be a fixed value but a percentage of the profit
When John talks about COVID cases in those workers, he’s right about them being on the line next to each other but I know plant workers and the real outbreaks come from the overcrowded houses many of the workers live in together. Many of the employees are immigrants living together, so at the end of the day, the packing companies could have all the mitigation efforts possible and still have employee outbreaks because the employees aren’t getting the virus at work, they’re getting it at home
With families like these, who needs enemies?...  I stopped eating chicken from companies like Tyson since 2009. When I watched Food Inc. 🤢 😢 😣 🐓
Tom I love how you expose these corpo fucks
It's bizarre how these state-level regulations slow down any real chance of progress. There should be a federal law protecting workers that every state must abide by, and public universal healthcare of course.
I currently work at a grocery store. No one is required to do temperature checks, no one does them and they are not enforced. They never were enforced anytime during this pandemic. The break room is regularly filled with people who aren't wearing masks and the management doesn't care about the break room being over capacity (not to mention that the break room regularly doesn't have water for employees when they need a break). Things like this make my blood boil.
John. John John John... John...   I must speak to you like a child, because mentally you are thinking like one.   Do us all a favor, fire your writers, and just... think for once before you actually open your mouth.   It's what your father taught you. But because he is not here, and your an American now, lets go over what would have happened in your utopia.  In every relationship there are multiple sides... not just one.  In this case, the customers, the people.  You present a picture here of the companies that they are heartless... and it's of course easy to do! as you have shown.  But lets turn the other cheek and just LOOK, look at it for a moment. What would have happened...  Lets assume, these companies decided instead to furlough workers, cut production, and slow lines down to socially distance.   you're probably then cutting production capacity down by AT LEAST 1/4th. most likely 1/8th of what it was doing.  Now... that means each plant produces oh, lets go worst case. 1/8th of what it was doing... what that would mean would be...  you'd have meat supplies for the country dropping to less than 20% before the pandemic, you'd have a food shortage,   Compound this, meat packing has this problem! but so does crops in general, and anything to do with manufacturing goods from crops! like corn, beans, legumes, greens, ect... all have very similar issues to what you just said!  so lets slow them down to, oh, only by 1/4th of their current speed! lets do that to protect the workers!  Which would lead to shortages at factories, which would lead to shortages of literally every food product in every city.  There would be a run on the markets, meat, any type of meat would be out of stock, any type of food would become astronomically expensive, as production ground to a near halt  Prices would skyrocket, there would be a run on any sort of preserved foods before those ran out (cans, frozen, ect), as the prices on those went up, food banks would empty, people would begin to starve.   Any regulation would just make it worse by the way... it always does, fixing price but limiting supply is part of what caused every socialist society to collapse.   Oh and it just THEN gets worse. The hogs/chickens/steer still NEED to go to market. The fruits and veggies must be picked, packed and sent on...  You cant turn off the fact these are animals growing... just like you couldn't turn off the fact that crops grow.  When you remove the ability to process, now you're left with an overabundance of supply to process. Anyone not locked into a contract is trying to offload everything they can... so the price DROPS. on every sort of supply, everything. Farms go bankrupt as they are unable to pay their bills... Then nothing gets grown as its in the courts.  Worst of all, those things not being able to be sold off will have to be put down, so we would be seeing piles of cows put down in fields, then set ablaze, along with crops that can go unused... healthy crops, food ready to be eaten would be destroyed because there was no place to put it, transport it, or process it. It wont happen.   Which will then be filmed and sent to cities, to where the people are starving because they cant get food, because the system breaks down.   So. In your utopia, we would have, massive starvation, riots in the streets, law and order completely breaking down, our country at least entering a great depression if not causing a global depression, massive hyperinflation to destabilize the currency, potentially even breaking down the social fabric as people use any means necessary to secure food for their families, and, if we're lucky, a death toll only in the tens of millions by  the end of it... with the world forever changed and never the same.    Now you may call me ridiculous that the government would not let it get to that point. You're right. They wouldn't, and most likely would nationalize the entire industry temporarily under something like the war powers act to force production to continue. Though this arguably would reduce output, and create long term problems for the entire country, most likely extending or worsening our current economic situation.   But fortunately, we didn't have to go that far, we didn't have to get the government involved at all. Thanks to the brave men and women, those who were willing to work, and keep food on the tables, we were able to get through the worst part of this nightmare without a world shattering event. By them showing up to work everyday and working hard, in those conditions, and yes some died of it, they made all our lives better. Those individuals are heroes and need to be thought of as such. Their sacrifices must not be in vein, and we as a society need to come together after the pandemic to thank them all and think how we can repay them for their sacrifice.  So now, as your substitute father figure you obviously didn't have as a child, I'll tell you this. John, you're a moron. Now do us all a favor, sit down, shut the hell up about things you know nothing about.
imagine this is America, and how much worse would meatpacking facilities would be in developing countries i.e. China...!
So glad I’m vegan... Best thing I ever did..
Now I am even happier that I do not eat meat or animal products.
A fraction of a f**k given... This are the people feeding america, they deserve better.
Please boicot these companies! You don't need to eat that shit! 🤢
As
The infamous bassoon immunochemically boil because glove initially wink vice a gainful cream. sleepy, laughable morocco
Love to have you back Oliver!
The only solution other than not eating meat is cannibalism
Maybe time to go vegan.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO, AFTER I READ FAST FOOD NATION I NEEDED ATTENTION BROUGHT TO THIS!!!!!!  post note: some attention brought to sanitization workers would be nice
I've worked for Butterball and Tyson for a total of just about 4 years, never going back to that kind of labor again. Glad to see this kind of video giving attention to this!
I'm thinking about being a vegetarian.  I think I can do it.  This video is great motivation.
P&G WV SHIFTS
Who won the betting pool at Tyson?
How dare you refer to Judi Dench without her title as Dame!
I'll always appreciate Last Week Tonight's main segments because it so important for us in a democratic self-governing society to learn about the unseen corners that are failing.  What I have a problem with is all the Americans who don't vote, dont understand how USG functions, and dont understand whos largely responsible(Republicans) for our inability to build a more perfect union. The ignorance of these Americans, who know nothing about the rest of the world, have driven themselves deep into a self-hating/"America is the worst" online echo chambers; exacerbated by foreign disinformation campaigns.  The fact is if you look around the world, very few countries are doing better than America.  UK: Yes, they have NHS and we should have something similar. But Brexit is partially similar to Trump's "Build The Wall". Their treatment of Albanian immigrant workers is no better than the way we treat our South America neighbors. China: The great Communist Utopia for online leftists. Why do you think everything is made in China? Its because there is no labor protections, no minimum wage enforcement, worse factory working conditions. Good healthcare is expensive. Cheap healthcare is a scam. AND under the CCP no Chinese citizen is ever allowed to organize a movement to make these things better.  Its to time be honest about whats good about America and what needs serious work/activism. Stop lying or fooling yourself about how everyone is better than us, because its just not true.
Who remembers when John Oliver was funny?
That “family” sounds like places I’ve worked for talking about their teachers who they treated like poo. 🤦🏾‍♀️
I'm so happy this is back
2:00 I love when businesses call their employees family. Turns out some families are abusive....
Capitalism kills.
https://youtu.be/OK9N4a17Gf4
Go Vegan!
Pretty bold move to treat people this way while knowing just how fast and skilled they can be with a knife.
Covid Kim Reynolds, Iowa's Governor first political contributor is pork processing. She didn't even bother to count the Tyson factory cases in our state Covid numbers in public health. In fact, recently she auctioned off an afternoon with herself for money and the pork processing guy bought it. Disgusting.
That nurse needs to be reported to the board. That's unacceptable. I worked as an EMT on standbys for sports and if I even had a slight suspicion of injury I would either call an ambulance or refer them for further aid. Unacceptable.
John always brings to light what most folks may not even be aware of but then it's up to us all to make the change. Not just watch this video "feel bad" then go about our day like nothing mattered.
Glad to see not much has changed since the Jungle
The world's fucking doomed and America is leading the charge. They not only commit human rights abuses on par with the worst but they genuinely fight for those abuses, pretend they're not abusing and manage to convince millions of other Americans that deregulation is a good thing and has them fight for the rights of abusive multi-national businesses. Unbelievable, honestly. Yeah, Tyson and Purdue definitely deserve less regulation, gotta save those jobs. Lol I don't get it, don't get that excuse. Is a horrible, mistreating job really worth saving, and is it not better to have that job be better with regulation? How many, how many times will we have to see what these huge companies do without regulation?
What else we can expect...
Office workers: we’re tired and stuff Company: our apologies, we’ll make this right  Factory floor: I need medical assistance ASAP  Company: you really wanna lose your job over a couple severed limbs?
Isn't everyone in America tired of no ethical integrity in any aspect of our society.? Capitalism is the cause of this can't everyone see that.? 500,000 americans dead from covid more than China and Russia, how can we have any superiority anywhere in the world when this country is so broken and so many ways.!
Remember when he was funny in 2015
Apparently I’m related to the Perdue guy... I’m ashamed.
here's one. for knowingly and willingly continuing a system During A Pandemic that is conducive to the spreading of that illness which caused the pandemic. in an environment that processes mass quantities of food. which could on it's own exponentially cause more cases of the virus. maybe take someone to federal court and charge them with domestic terrorism. make an example of a CEO or two and remind them all you live in a Republic, not an Oligarchy.
I don't want to take away from the meat workers horrible conditions, it's bad and needs to be fixed. But all factory jobs are like this, the disconnect from management to workers, the having to go see"nurses", each year loosing more and more safety, factory jobs can suck
I definitely thought he was going to bring back the Adam Driver bit lol
If you still have moisture left to urinate, you're not working hard enough. You're too moist.
That’s deplorable behavior. Denying your workers bathroom breaks. If you’re not smart enough to figure out how to let an employee pee when they want, you’re not smart enough to run that big of an industry. Period.
My mom, a Mexican immigrant, worked at an IBP plant in the early 80s and while her experience was good, with good pay, she did notice that the overwhelming majority of her coworkers were minorities and/or immigrants. Management was overwhelmingly White. She said that apart from Hispanics, the second largest group there were Southeast Asians. She said they were quite the hard-working people. She also noticed something else which I will not repeat here because she would be called racist even though she's not. It was just an observation that made an impression on her since the only people she was ever exposed to before were other Mexicans.
Fuck OSHA- these NEED to be Union jobs
I also love how these reporters on the news view everything out of context and act like theyre above everyone. As disgusting as what that man did was, you got to understand the reasoning for it. Its sad that this man was so worried about losing his job that he had to literally piss on the floor. I wish there was a way to make these morons at the top of their companies work a day or two in their employees shoes.
Dude lose the jokes ffs!
How about close all those fucking plants and go vegan already!! We've been saying for years!! It's not just about the animals.. glad it's finally getting out about these people's work environment, but it took a fucking pandemic for people to take a look!!!!
sorry but id give up that whole list for my family
This is one of the reasons I went vegan, our animal agriculture system disrespects both animal and human life.
Release the Texas segment if you can please.  Thanks!
OSHA has always been a bullshit joke. I worked in a lawn and garden factory that made chainsaws, weed eaters, leaf blowers, etc. right out of high school and the conditions were terrible. Testing booths where they calibrated motors were not properly ventilated and people who worked in there all day were often having to leave the booths and go get oxygen at the nurses station because of the massive amounts of exhaust from the product engines they were having to breathe making them sick. A lot of them complained of migraine headaches and developed such health issues as asthma and other lung ailments. The ventilation systems in the factory were ancient and supposedly OSHA visited the plant every year but nothing was ever done about it. I worked on the assembly line and the air guns to bolt parts together were little more than junk that constantly malfunctioned and even hurt people. There was one air gun that we nicknamed 'scatter gut' because it would lock up and suddenly whirl around and catch you right in the stomach if you were standing too close to it. I only ever lasted three weeks at a chicken plant. That's a whole other story I won't go into. Johns doing a great job with it though. None of this surprises me.
HOLY SHIT I SAID SPAGHETTI IN MY HEAD
As long as articles of incorporation are mandated to prioritize stockholders over workers and customers we'll continue to see workers abused and customers ripped off.   We need to change the way businesses are allowed to operate.  If you want to hire workers, their health and welfare while at work must be the priority.  When government allows or permits or fails to act, that government should be viewed as illegitimate.
How the fuck do we continue to let these big name corporations get away with this shit? Its absolutely insane. I cant imagine being such a shitty human being who values a few extra dollars in profit over the well being of my workers. These people are what keeps these companies alive and yet the company doesn’t seem to care whether they live or die. Their answer is to just go and find someone else to replace them. Probably at a cheaper wage to boot! What a wonderful fucking country we live in.
"the race to the bottom will just continue"  yep, pretty much sums up capitalist america in the 21st century
A good book about all of this and more is "Fast Food Nation" by Eric Schlosser. I  think there is a movie, but I know the book hits real hard.
Was zum fick ist daa passiert😳
i've worked a number of low-wage jobs at companies that treated its workers like dirt, and they sure loved to call us "family." it seems like that's just the way things work in the united states if your job isn't specialized and salaried
About the whole "horrific events in a country"... horrific events happen. They just do. Generally, there is no way to predict them nor prevent them. I repeat: generally.  I'm not going to give example scenarios, there are plenty already. The measure of how "great" a country is or not, is how it responds to that event in the _long term_ . After every event there is a reaction and a response. The reaction is seen in the media the following days and is usually front, face and center. The _response_ is how things have changed the following months and years. 9/11 happened and you can now see how it has altered transportation. Columbine happened and you can see how it has altered gun ownership control (has it?). Covid happened and you can see a year later how _the world_ has changed. Next year we'll have a better view of how we prepare ourselves for similar events.  If i were to guess, that would be "badly".
in 1975 there were loaDS OF GOOD JOBS IN MEAT PACKING PLANTS ALL AROUND EVERY M,METROPOLITIN AREA, AT LEAST 35 WERE AROUND nj..SUPERMARKETS USED TO TAKE IN SIDES OF BEEF & CUT IT UP FOR THE CUSTOMERS EVERYDAY,buT THEM THOSE JOBS DISAPPEARED & WENT OUT WEST & SOUTH..
Mostly minority or illegal workers who don't give a shit about cleanliness. Just there for the money. Jobs like these are are easy to come by.
I'm sure it sucks to work in meatpacking. I was a line cook for 10 years and that was bad enough. John Oliver continuing to blow my mind. Shitty leadership out there in a lot of places. How about we treat each other like human beings?
Ah, what "The Jungle" was actually about
Who won the pool?
Thank you, John Oliver. The world needs more mainstream outlets talking about the disgusting exploitation of humans and animals, taking place every day in America.
Fucking corporate man..  usually people in the office arent any fucking smarter than an entry level employee..
i'd totally swipe right on you bro 😏
I'm watching as I'm eating Perdue chicken tenders....whoops
huh. We're about the same age
Why does it happen? Because it's America, profits come before all else, including human lives.
videos like this one are good only when he doesn’t push politics. Keep them like this
DADDY OLIVER IS BACK
Yeah, those working conditions, favoritism for corporate and being a "human machine" 8s nothing new. As a guy born into a working class family and still working what job I can get to barely get by, I've seen nothing but these things. Especially in retail.
How dare you, Jon Oliver, for pushing your UK centric agenda. Judi Dench isn't number 3. ... It's Tom Hanks.
I was a supervisor at Sanderson farms, our superattendant used to tells us to get rid of employees that looked like trouble for the company, complained to much or needed to see the company's nurse, or if they went to see a doctor try and get rid of them as quick as we can or just put them on a position that they weren't be able to perform the job. 3000 salary payment aint enough for the job a supervisor has to do
If you like Tropic Thunder give a thumbs up & pass it on to all comments. Save Comedy!
I worked 15 years for Tyson and have the scars to prove it. Oliver is the first one that I've seen attempt to expose the extent of this mess. The law protects those who are committing the atrocities.
Oliver is such a Douche.
i only came here because it said meatpacking and John Oliver in the title so disappointed😂
I feel like John has made many videos that now fully surround the idea that we should all be vegan, without coming right out and saying it.
Don't forget Foster Farms, livingston, CA
To eat meat people sacrifice huge land mass, forests, species, who now has nowhere to go, lives of beautiful animals and health and wealth of fellow citizens... Isn't too disgusting of a meal habit to continue? How many lives should be wasted for you to consume your portion of someone's flesh?
so you want them to move to mexico
Ah, More evidence the America is a dystopian capitalistic Hellscape attempting to masquerade as a functional society.
Those nurses need to all have their licenses revoked.
God Damn! That’s it, I’m going Vegan. What a joke the US has become. Makes me sick to think of all those people, hoping to get a better life in America, to be a slave to the chicken king.
And people swear "everything is not about race." Where are the comparitive numbers of white identified people working in those conditions and in 2021, having to degrade themselves by even taking such job positions? I'm still up pissed that all we have to choose from is damn broiler chickens. See. . . Wtf? Immediately the f*ck sh*t with Tyson corporate. FOH 🙅 overt racism, Tyson.
FUBAR!
My poor little brother worked in a meat packing plant IBP in Amarillo tx when he was 18, by his first year he couldn't close he fingers to make a fist anymore. He told me that he they had him at a station that was meant for four workers but they only had two because why hire more to help when they could just have two worker but still expect them do the work of four. He stayed till his body couldn't take it anymore so 3yrs.
Go vegan
Ok but now let's talk about retail, John. yeah meat packing is worse, but let's talk about "not enough payroll to have enough people to functionally run a store but you have you keep it open even if there's only two of you" is awfully fucked up
Pretty sure that Guiney Pig is related to the rabbit from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
Where are Rihanna and mia Khalifa now?
“Clearing your mind and relaxing… stuff you can do at work…”
This is simply a snapshot into the truth of how big business exploits the American Worker, under the guise of  “less government conservatism” ...
Thanks.  new vegetarian here...
Excellent work John. DISGUSTING...Tyson should be fined.... 13.8 million for just one plant... And 3.8 million for every other plant..in this nation... Betting on who will contract Covid19 is morbidly sick... Management should fined and removed from their positions...Period...
we'd better start pressuring the current administration to massively increase funding for OSHA
cheap meat, taste the exploitation
Can't these meat packers just learn to code or something?
I just watch inception before going to sleep.. to take my mind off it, watched Vanilla sky for the first time.. than for some reason i needed something to take the edge off, now here i am... needless to say that i won’t sleep tonight and i need to reconsider how i make my choices.
I forgot How happy and sad this show Makes me
This is the actual reason why I'm vegetarian.
9 CFR § 310.1 - Extent and time of post-mortem inspection; post-mortem inspection staffing standards.
Everybody gangsta till John Oliver starts body slamming Industry corruption.
Can you do an episode about South Africa
I can already sum this up; Meat is gross! Eat bugs!!
Idk how John Oliver stays so outraged - at this point I feel numb. Seems like every aspect of the modern world is crumbling.
What ever John. I like you, but you're just a mouthpiece for the ECE (East Coast Elites). I think you have good intentions, but the road to hell is paved with them.
This is so anecdotal and stupid
youre missing the big picture here John, these poor workers are there in those factories because of everyone else is consuming meat. These corporations wont do anything for these workers and never will, its up to us to help them transition to better and safer jobs that dont require killing innocent animals.
Also like, here are these companies trying to run their employees so raw they have to make them wear diapers, and unemployment looks like it does.  I'm not saying I want to get a job on a poultry line, but there are a lot of people who'd be perfectly willing to if conditions were better and pay was better, and part of making that happen would be slower lines and more workers.  AND LOWER PROFITS AND CEO PAY
Just another reason to live vegan.
there are plenty of good reasons to fire someone... like fleeing to cancun when your state is in an environmental crisis
Most of these meat companies are evil in one way or another. they should treat their employees better and they should treat the animals better and people should try to transition from eating meat products eating plant-based meats. I know it's not always that easy to change but we could all move in that direction. God bless you.
The same tornado neurally belong because swamp peroperativly suppose towards a rebel cupcake. abstracted, embarrassed second
if you hear stories like that, even if you think one or another fact might be unproportional, it still shows you how capitalism in its probably purest form (and that is the USA) in fact is not much better than communism was. The only difference being that in one case amoral state authorities were the perpetrators in the other case its the amoral capitalists (CEO´s, main share holders etc.). The results are the same, the working man gets f.... .Communism came down by the capitalists and well the only time when capitalists, then called aristocracy, came down, was the french revolution. So you amoral people of all sides, be aware what one day might happen. But i guess the uneducated americans of all social classes do know nothing about the french revolution. Just look it up, it was a bloody mess.
Imagine if poultry lines ran at a slow enough pace that you didn't bite into a huge glob of fat every time you ate a chicken finger.
Pro tip just don't eat meat. There is no good reason to eat meat other than selfish want.
My girlfriend always said that I was good at meat packing.  I wonder what she was talking about?
Let us still yard bird funny shit love this.
And yet there isn't shit anyone can do to fix it. Same as always.
Great video, as always!  I enjoy the show!  Keep it up.  I always gain insight, new knowledge and a lot of times, revelation.  -   I publicly proclaim myself as a republican.  Though my views I hold personally may differ from the party.  They just happen to align with my views more than democrats.  One could even say that I am a "protest-republican" because I am siding with republicans out of protest of actions from the left-wing.....
I'm just wondering how much harder on them you'd have been if they weren't paying you to go easy on them.
Glad someone big finally said it: Veganism isn't just an animals rights issue, it's also a human rights issue... and a climate issue.
Can’t eat meat without some human rights abuse being apart of your meal.
The food industry in the U.S. is so messed up top down for so many reasons. You barely know what you're putting into your body AND employees work in horrid conditions and under constant pressure due to DEMAND AND MASS PRODUCTION. If the world ate as much meat at the US, we'd need at least 3-4 planets just for the cattle and chickens to grow on.
Watch your generics if you want to avoid these companies. Aldi chicken is Tyson; I shop there but I don't buy the chicken. I've already stopped eating pork and am cutting out beef and turkey. It's not safe to eat it or for anyone to work there.
I know someone who lost a thumb in a meatpacking plant more than 20yrs ago. Was offered $20,000 in a settlement and took it without consulting any lawyers thinking they'd hit the lottery. That person died destitute in less than 10yrs. If you're poor and uneducated in the good ol' USA.. you're pretty much fucked!
The free market works as intended to.

John i work here in one of these plants. A pork meatpacking plant and I laughed HARD when you said about lines should be kept at a safe speed.  Im like biiiiiiitch I got 4 seconds on a good day to cut what I need to cut on a ham before it rolls along to finish its journey. It never stopped believing better than me I must say. For I gotta be high as eagle titties to stand a night there
'MURICA!
Many companies in many industries treat their hourly or production workers like crap. These are the folks who actually do the work.
Seems like “The Jungle” hasn’t improved much.
Does anyone watch an episode like this and say "i had no idea" honestly?
BURDEN BEARERS   Leviticus 4:1-10 Levi Tribe Clans in Ancient Israel’s sojourns in the wilderness were designated to carry different parts of the ‘Tent of the LORD’s Presence’ from spot to spot. That was their sole job and privilege. But what seems honourable, privileged, and important; can become routine, burdensome, and demeaning. In life too, the real, serious, painful, burdens seem to be disproportionately borne by some while others are happy. It’s like GOD chose some to ‘hate’ and others to ‘love’. JESUS came to be our burden bearer so the woes you walk with has a purpose in Him no matter how heavy. Trust in Him.
Price poor people pay to ensure rich can have their way of life.
The explanation for every story should just be "republicanism"

Wait...my parents were supposed to bribe me with gifts?
Soooo what chicken nugget brand do I buy to air fry?

Shows how not funny it is without the laugh track. It’s like Big Bang theory
John, how did you know I started to eat meat again this last week? I feel attacked.
How many people are going to watch this, feel bad for a few hours, and then go back to eating meat as they always have? Sigh. Yes, reform is necessary! But an easier and faster way would be to stop supporting these unethical companies with our dollars.
Ha!
Unions?  No mentions of Unions? That would help.
But what about your eternity? God loved you so much that He sent His Son to die for you, so that if you believe, you won't perish but have eternity

The government cannot do anything but you can. STOP BUYING MEAT. You don't need it and you are supportkng this shit when you do.
I don't think anything is too much for meat eaters. They don't really care what happens to animals, people or our planet. All they care about is not being criticized for their choices.
Make it a criteria for hire that all middle management and above have to spend at least one shift working on the line. If they still don't respect their line employees then they truly have no souls.
now that trump is gone we are back to the regular program
if Last Week Tonight could actually affect as much change as it does just making people feel good after watching it, that might be an actual accomplishment... I'm getting pretty tired of learning about the world's problems week after week when literally nothing is ever actually done about any of it... the formula of identifying an issue, pointing out how systemically depressing it is, and then reminding us how unrealistic the solutions are (given the current state of our greedy, vapid society) is becoming super extra depressing lately. clips from this show are always TRENDING... it's just too bad that some actual ACTION and resolution never seems to follow. you could've done this Meatpacking story 20 years ago. in 10 years you'll be able to do it again. nothing changes. money and greed will take everything beautiful from humanity until humanity goes extinct on this sick and dying planet...
Yeah, I'd be fine with this whole industry just not existing
We're all family coming from corporate suits translates to bend over while we fuck up harder in the ass.
This show really hits different without the audience laughing in the background
Anyone read The Jungle?
Upton Sinclair 2.0
The problem is the food industry will immediately sue over this piece.  They have far too much political power to the point they can just write their own laws.  Good luck ever seeing this situation get better.

I stopped buying Tyson and started purchasing from local butcher shops. It's about 3 dollars more and has helped me move towards plant based meat options but it makes me feel less dirty
I always wonder why people move to America, then spend their lives telling us how we should be more like the place that they moved here from. In Jon's case, is there anything in the USA that he thinks is OK?  Wouldn't it be easier to just move back to Jolly Ole England and live happily ever after. Craig Ferguson is my kind of transplant. He seems happy to be here.
This is why the deregulation of big business must be reversed if there were more regulations that would help those in the packing industry. and if we still had federal regulations across the country .texas wouldn't have suffered the brunt of Republican deregulation.
Thank you for the _Muppets Take Manhattan_ reference.  The best one!
Let's GET SOME CHANGE IN THIS FOUL INDUSTRY! Maybe 25 years ago machines to replace all these workers (yes, people need jobs, but this work is brutal and we can't keep contesting that--we need to make it less brutal NOW, IMMEDIATELY to help these brave workers AND implement the automated machinery that NOW <yeah, maybe not 25 years ago, but which definitely NOW exists>) were "too expensive" but that's really not the case now and again, these companies make BILLIONS. When you're in the BILLIONS territory regardless of what industry you are, you can literally throw money at a problem. With their BILLIONS they should be made to SLOW THE LINES, put each person in their own socially distanced glass protected area, hire consultants, etc. "OMG, that would cost money"--to a company literally sitting in BILLIONS of dollars. Who have zero moral compass and must be forced, by democratically elected government, to do the right thing. Who have no qualms about selling inferior products tainted with human misery.   Again, meat production and consumption drives climate change so THIS AFFECTS EVERYONE whether you eat meat or not --we need to walk & chew gum at the same time & make fundamental changes to help these workers NOW, make their daily llives more safe and less brutal WHILE ALSO reforming the industry as a whole--standard practices--OSHA funding & teeth aka enforcement and real fines to drive real reforms and ultimately replacing many of these jobs with machines! It's not realistic to expect everyone to stop eating meat, or all at once. (Maybe someday we'll all eat ethical plant based "meat." I'm not into fake meat or real meat, actually the "standard American diet" gave me diabetes so I can't eat much of anything anymore, but this isn't about me, except to say I have no skin in the game except as an oxygen-breathing resident member of Earth. I don't think vegetarians, reducetarians, vegans should fight each other. Food customs die very hard and expecting worldwide abstention from animal or fish is not going to happen any time soon, if it happens at all--and not to say it won't, but it's not on the immediate horizon; not even a pandemic could damper the demand for meat, let's put it that way.)   No matter what diet you follow, you can agree this is not a good way to make products--unsafe for everyone except desk jockeys! Workers deserve dignity & respect  & ultimately machines can do much of this so humans don't experience carpel tunnel/RSI (totally real and disabling). Or, you know...death. The highest death rate of ALL industries for over 100 years and no substantial action on our government because everyone gets a cut except the workers. I have carpel tunnel and it's no joke. I fully support the workers and I can only imagine the economic and other pressures they are under. I really wish workers could strike but OMG there might be meat shortages...well, maybe people, Americans, should be a little less culinarily comfortable for a while in solidarity with their fellow exploited humans, who are all being exploited by capitalism the way the creative class is being exploited by capitalism as well...  for the haters, I am writing in colloquial style.../don't know how YT is treating asterisks these days--peace
The commercial at the beginning really upset my dog.
I watch this show occasionally just to remind myself how thankful I am that  I was not born or be part of the shit hole country.
I'm honestly surprised that machines aren't doing all this work.
My boi gonna get sued
Great job!!! 5 years vegan! I'm lovin it... mother nature finally had enough.
You are basically a meat packing worker for the liberal media. How does that make you feel?
☝John has passion. It's great.
Funny  To Republican owners “Meat Packing” sounds like a weekend at the gay sex club. 🤔
Remember the flu? It was friends with the common cold. Boy, were those the days before people were so gullible.
CEO's are the enemy of the people.
Our relationship with the animal kingdom will continue to result in more zoonotic diseases like COVID 19 hopping from animals to humans, going Pandemic and ultimately Endemic. Here we are.
If they claim to have no moral obligations to their "family" of workers, then don't be surprised when they claim to have no moral obligations to provide a healthy product.
Family is corporate speak for "we're going to pretend like we care about you so we can demand more from you without proportionate compensation because family is there for each other during hard times, which just so happens to he 24/7. What's that? You need financial/medical help? Sorry, but we're in a tight spot right now, but I'm sure you understand, because we're family"
wtf
What if Judi Dench is family?
Damn, wtf, so bad and disgusting. What's been done to change these conditions? Is anyone suing or doing anything?
This is exactly why workers need Unions, and should fight everything that limits their right to peacefully assemble as an American citizen.
Never thought I’d feel famous for the East Texas Pilgrim’s pride shoutout.

It actually would be pretty amazing to hear you talk about a deep dive into factory farms. Yes, they do get talked about a good bit but it's the same vegans watching them, waiting for the rest of the world to give a fuck. If your audience heard and saw the realities, maybe there would be a shift. On that note, I wish one of your recommendations at the end could have been to think about a consumer shift towards less meat consumption.
he’s Christian too. no surprise.
So basically white and people white people like get the good positions with pointless bullshit perks while the rest of everyone struggles?
My friend lost his middle finger at a packing plant bought out by Tyson. Best week ever... he bought a new $10,000 sport bike with the check.  It was totally his fault too.  He was a minority and he didn't give afuccc like most employees there.
YES!!!!!! Miss Piggy sex tape! 👏👏👏👍 I am here for the Muppet jokes. Keep em coming, sir!
John, tone down the swears, would you? Not really necessary to drop the F word every other minute.
Sounds like OSHA is basically just a symbolic gesture of regulation.
Meat production is inherently dangerous for workers. Animals flail when being killed, which causes excruciating injuries to kill floor workers

So glad im a vegetarian...
This segment hits home bc I actually work at the Sanderson Farms TYPC in Texas...
bad for the humans, bad for the animals, bad for the planet, GREAT FOR BUSINESS!!! what a short sighted shame
I know this is not the point of this piece, but did anyone else identify with his ranking of important things in your life maybe just a little to much?
This is what you get by busting labor unions into near nonexistence for any organization that isnt police and ICE. I thought "The Jungle" was supposed to be a cautionary tale, not freaking notes on how to run a successful business.
more reasons to be vegetarian
Oh you should see the nice plants in Central Europe. Really nice... and exactly the same shit: Exploiting low-income workers without any Covid protection.
So what you're saying is, support local butchers, step away from large markets, and understand that the money you spend isn't just about you but also the business practices and community that you're supporting.
Why do i have to use a VPN if i wanna watch this?
what kind of psychopath is disliking this video LULZ wow.
No words
The workers bitch about being called machines until machines can actually do their Jobs.
This is life in manufacturing in general. At a factory that recently closed in my city I worked at for 13 years, every example you gave happened. A co-worker had to piss in a box to avoid being fired, as there was a contour l culture of diapers for those with weak bowels. Her lawsuit made it so EVERY Minnesotan now can't be reused restroom access. My mother sued for years for her damage shoulders to have surgery. They settled on one shoulder and a cash out. A friend smashed his hand from a fork lift accident. Didn't turn it in out of fear of reprisal. My nurse's station was basically a Tylenol and Icy-Hot dispensary and nothing else. HR dog whistled firing over reporting, even when they'd lose a arbitration case with the local over it... Just to keep the state/feds out.  We need far more than just expanded osha and meat packing Covid-19 rights, we need cultural reform on the treatment of "unskilled labor."  But, thank you to your team for making this one. It hit me hard as two local packing houses had Covid-19 deaths and "temporary closures for deep cleaning," while firing activists for anything to keep it quiet.
Adam driver would love to pack his ...
Eating meat while watching this.
What a eye opener!!
Uncontrolled capitalism fucks the people time and time again, but yet half of America (see senate vote) still wants to deregulate more.
Robot fuck a soup? Yes please! Lol
John forgot to mention that a lot of these companies who hire immigrants actually go to other countries or via intermediaries to offer Jobs at food companies and possible citizenship( not always) they been doing it since the late 90's in order to not pay American workers more and provide benefits. wanted to point that out before people start saying "immigrants took paying jobs"
I don’t understand it. These people have the money to pay workers a decent wage. Even a high middle class life. Yet they choose to spend that money on bribing politicians and trying to save money that they will most likely never see because they will die beforehand of old age
I’m trying hard to be a pescatarian.
Who loves deep state foreigners telling us what to think?
Hey duncan
Vote with your dollar. Buy local
I hate this country. We are a selfish species.
It's almost like the worship of money and the rejection of everything else as having worth, including human life, makes for an economic system that promotes insane atrocities in the pursuit of money.  Oh yeah: go vegan.
Vote with your dollars, do not buy any products from these companies!!
Yeah it kind of seems like we shouldn't eat meat
Brainwashing
LWT & John Oliver need to cover The Fairness Doctrine.. It’s important history. Surprised it hasn’t been covered.  Reagan admin removed it, paving way for Limbaugh, who paved way for Trump.  It needs to be reinstated.  Help me get this topic request to John Oliver.
While this is all horrible, I’d like to point that that you had an amazing opportunity for a joke about the observant owl... “what a cluck”.
Oh god, that promo reminded of Every 90s Commercial Ever 😂😂😂
Glad you're back John, but your exposure of how fucking evil capitalism is will continue to punish my liver...
Did... Did the show get new writers or something?
You are family till they fire you and walk you to the door. What a lie. I have seen people denied workers comp when they were hurt on the job and tricked into signing papers that waived their rights, and then they were fired. And the guy had to pay for the surgery out of his own pocket. Was that like family?
Not one single manufacturing company anywhere gives a damn about their blue collar workers.
I've missed you John Oliver.  Don't ever take a break again!! -Love, Loyal viewer ❤
People will bitch and complain for more regulations in the industry then those same people will bitch and complain when the price of a chicken breast goes up by a few cents.
All these problems and change will happen probably a century later
They are rushing to automate!!!  Why did he not mention that topic?
Thought this was about the schrodinger's penis.
The leading "deadpool" story was common knowledge in Eastern Iowa a year ago but no one cared nationally. Eastern Iowa got hit with an inland hurricane six months later but no one cared nationally, but we're still here keeping the food supply going without any help or sympathy
sorry - no sympathy for anyone that kills for a living
Boycott all of these companies.
I spit up my ice cream "A perverted owl watches!" LOL
Get'um Jon.
eh
Morgan Spurlock's movie on the chicken industry will show you just how big a scumbag Tyson Foods is.
The scary flavor quickly switch because punishment serendipitously zoom during a boring mini-skirt. alluring, level pike
Tyson doesn't care about anyone in the business. If you look at your last video (https://youtu.be/X9wHzt6gBgI) on chicken, Tyson is housing their workers the same as the farmers need to raise chickens. Tyson has no idea what humanity or a soul really is.
Wondering how many people who watch this video and think "how awful" will go buy and eat a meat product shortly thereafter, thereby continuing to support this wretched industry.   U can opine about how the govt needs to fix the problem, but how long do u think that'll take? Especially with industry lobby money pouring into politicians' campaign funds, how confident are u that govt will solve this problem?   Take some personal responsibility here and stop spending your hard earned income on such disgusting companies.
I'm a farmer johnny and you can't beat my meat.
"There is a nurse but she doesn't do anything." American public school students: yeah that checks.
The working class always suffers and the people at the top mke money from it
Capitalism at its best...
Trump, that piece of sh*t just increased linespeeds back in January of this year. I'm assuming someone from the Senate either bribed or gave him some bs explanation on how this would be beneficial for workers.
Dame Judy Dench. Put some respect on it.
Im not saying being a cook is anywhere near as bad as this but people dont realize that these companies dont care about laws. As a cook for 15 years I will tell you we if we ask for a break we get treated like we will be replaced. Cooks dont get lunch breaks? Sexual harrasment is a mainstay with how women are treated. We are "asked" at the end of our shift if we can work longer because they run skeleton staffs. Its sad how essential workers are treated. These conditions are what a lot of us face and now we got Covid to deal with all on 18k a year?   Heres the worst part, ive tried reporting this to the BBB and they told me to show proof...what am I supposed to do? Walk around recording my day? Also, I work in a right to work state where they can fire you without any reason.   Its sad. Now we get the hopes of 15$ an hour and we all know that will never pass. Its the life I have and still praise God for every day given. Just keep this in mind next time you have a chance to tip.  God Bless
Customers don't care otherwise there would be major boycotts. Customers just want cheap. It is always the bottom line and pocketbook economics.  "Hey, I got children to feed."
I worked security for several weeks at a Tyson plant in Michigan.  This is all true.
Go Republicans!!
Pretty much all of the United States problems are caused by the greed of the 1%.  It is not the rights fault.  It is not the lefts fault.   It is the 1% and those who have sold out to them which is darn near every Republican politician and nearly every Democrat politician who are to blame.
The irony that Oxfam is reporting on how bad the meat industry is...
Great Video.  I'm guessing this is why packing companies are pushing to have meat processed overseas, then sent back???
gotta love deregulations
Ah 2020. Where murder hornets were the least tragic thing to happen
APUSH kids entered the chat
Maybe people need to stop buying misery meat. The demand drives this BS.  The CEO's are getting rich while causing human suffering.
This country needs mental health reform in order to help everything.
Bo Pilgrim even looks like a fucking Bond villain.
#TRUMP2024
OSHA, the IRS, NHS, USPS, they have all been woefully underfunded and understaffed for decades, and the solutions are always the same. The right says the free market will fix the problems, the left says more taxes, but no one actually does anything.
Sadly this is the result of years of Republican "leadership" in the states where these plants are (you wont see workers treated this badly in blue states). There is no doubt that some Democratic leaders are out of touch with reality. But to consistently see this happen over and over with workers being treated like worthless property is something that only happens in red "right to work" states where Republicans control the Governors office, the legislature, and the courts.  Yes my Republican Americans. These states did get many more "jobs". But honestly this is only several steps above the wealthiest people "owning slaves".  I must apologize to my Afro-American brothers and sisters for this comparison, the thought of slavery must have terrible feeling associated with it. But honestly in my humble opinion its not that far off, and its getting worse every year. Wake up people! Do you think the average Joe or Jane is getting a fair shake while the owners of this company continue to amass incredible amounts of wealth on the backs of these workers? This will continue as long as the Republican Party keeps getting less educated, lower wage Americans to vote for them against their own best interests.
Jbs is actually a very sketchy company from Brazil. They have been involved in a few (many) scandals  over here... Their CEOs actually went to jail for a while... Not sure why it actually functions in the US. Most of their products got rebranded here to try to fool the customers after the sh&t hit the fan.
This one hit pretty close to home.  I worked in a "lean manufacturing" facility for awhile making N95 masks, and that job was like a luxury vacation compared to this.  The slowest operating station's cycle time was 6 seconds.  The money was okay, but they burned through employees like nothing.  You were fodder.  Benefits?  Good luck with that.  And as for the "diversity" of the workplace, I overheard a conversation between two co-workers talking about the supervisors.  It went something like "you know, the white guy."  "You mean that one guy?"  "No, the other one."    Almost all of the workers were minorities.  The "team leaders," supervisors, and managers were on balance white.  And again, this was a "good" factory with "good" pay and conditions.
That's what u get when you sell your company to Brazilians.
This is another great illustration of the many problems with the meat industries. But HBO, please, please make the section of this episode about the Texas power grid available on YouTube. People NEED to see that so much right now!
All of the dislikes are from meatpacking corporate staff and the staff of politicians they've bribed
The depressed softball acly warn because macaroni advisably fancy versus a silent wrecker. plastic, juvenile laura
No live audience reacting makes this show so awko
We should all protest by being vegetarian for a year
At 5:38 they talk about how horrible it must be to wear a diaper and stand in your own piss. How about LIVING your ENTIRE life in an enclosure covered not only in your own piss and feces, but the piss and feces of all the other animals packed in there with u.
Jon had to sprinkle some racism against white people. Gj
Boo boo John sucks
Four, Sam’s club, five, oh fuck off ok...
As always, this show is the best at making depressing stories digestible
There's no way that company has $50B in profits, they're roughly that in revenue.
Wait , three words, Target
I think you would have fun looking into how ups has ran during the pandemic.
No wait, two word, Walmart
And people believe they stop the machines and throw away a few hundred pounds of meat when one or two of those human fingers gets ground up with the rest.... 👌 ok.
I once worked for at a meat plant before and the thing about the nursing staff and needing to  go there first was absolutely true. In fact, even if you had the company's insurance, if you went your doctor for work related without a referral from the onsite doctor (who was there once a week and was extremely hard to get in to get a referral), the insurance company would deny your claim and you would have to pay out of pocket for all treatment and doctor visits. They even said that "ring worm" was "impossible" to contract via hogs and one of my friends got really sick before finding a loophole by going to the ER to get covered by their insurance company (but they had to get sick enough to "qualify" as an actual emergency).
Life lesson from this episode: sometimes you’re the hamster, sometimes you’re that dog. Life.
One word. Amazon
Stopped watching not because I disagreed with any commented on, but because I was so enraged that someone could treat their workers so poorly and still feel like they are a good person. And the hilarity of it all is that it has been proven over and over that better treated workers perform better and make the company more money.
That’s disgusting? Never eaten out I guess.
My favorite blame game was Trump's HHS secretary Alex Azar blamed "home and social" conditions of the workers. They live too close together, that's why they got sick. First of all, no, and second of all how about paying workers well enough to where they don't have to live like that?
If any company ever says "we're a family" RUN. In my experience that has only ever been used as a way to take advantage of and gaslight employees.
America is a nutshell.
And it was a tough call ranking Judi Dench after food, water & shelter also.
"Only give a fraction of a fuck."  My new favorite phrase !
I'll never buy from Tyson again
Quit, if you work for someone that pays your bills and calls u family and u believe that, that’s when I call you dumb dumb.
One of the many agencies gutted by the last administration 😢
Ok ok I need a John Oliver meditation tape. That was calming
Wondering who’s eating less meat after watching this
We need to bring back unions this is modern slavery Time for me to be a vegetarian
Hold the comments, getting popcorn now....
Why does this remind me of Tender is the flesh?! 😅😅
Dear John,  TYSON EMPLOYEE MOLESTES TURKEY:  You might want to fact check me on the year;  In 1992 or 93 an article came out, (that's before the internet y'all millennials and an article was something in a newspaper), that was TRULLY comical and disturbing.  Three Tyson poultry processors were caught of video raping a turkey moments before it was slaughtered for processing.  As bad as the act of pissing under a work station is, imagine not only the guy who ejaculated in the the vent of the Turkey, that's the asshole in simple talk, but I remember clearly the article condemning and mocking the 2 other guys that held the bird by it's wings while their Buddy raped it!   Who else can remember this?
If you're watching this feeling disgusted maybe consider picking up the vegan option at your grocery store next time! Small steps ! <3
The crazy thing is, the power is in the people, if all the workers and future potential workers said, we aren't going to work until you better our work conditions, these businesses would die in a week, but then at the same time, the workers would die without the companies because they have no other way of making a living. And these companies made sure who they targeted the right people. It's a never ending cycle of the little guy losing, until they get fed up and stand up for themselves.
I mean if we force big company to make a "safer workplace", eventually we, the normal consumers, will pay for it. More or less like ask middle class to give away their money to lower class.
Gotta admit, a little surprised that a Last Week Tonight episode titled "Meatpacking" had not a single bit involving Adam Driver somehow wedged in. Not disappointed, just surprised.
Well in my opinion (and we know what opinions are) it all falls back on our government to allow this. You can not blame the assholes that run these places to make as much money as possible. How in the hell does the owners of these companies get away with hiring undocumented workers in the first place. If this government did it job any company caught hiring a undocumented worker should be fined or if it happened over maybe 3 or 4 times those companies should be shut down completely. We can spend billions going to f-n Mars but we dont have enough money to hire the amount of OSHA workers to mak we sure these plants are up to standards and make sure these plants are held accountable for what laws are being broken. All of what John is saying falls in the fault of the state, local and federal governments.
TYSON?  First I didn't like how they treated chickens & those who farmed them........ then the Mexican labor they treated more like indentured servants who were VERY disposable.......and NOW, covid.... Just Say NO To Tyson!!!  But first prop that fat white guy with the clean white coat out there on the LINE! For 12 hours straight!!!
I remember reading about this crap in junior high when I read The Jungle by Upton Sinclair, written in 1906.
Was the factory with the lottery the one who the Chinese own & management team visited after the CCPV took off in China?
maybe do not eat meat
The Jungle. An extremely relevant book about the meatpacking industry. Go read it if you haven't, go read this classic.
This is what happens when we all read The Jungle in 10th grade but not the whole thing because cApiTAliSm
this video is the final push i needed to fully become a vegetarian
Damn John... What happened? Did all your good writers catch covid and die? Lol!
I remember hearing about the COVID Tyson plant incident when I was still stuck in England.  Just driving down A11 listening to NPR and we get this one podcast talking about the meat packing scandal.  These people could not protest without getting fired nor risk the financial woes if they lose their job.  The regulations they had to 'prevent' the spread was to 'not get it.'  if they did guess what they were fired.
Who is Judy Dench and why is she a treasure?
I will admit that I still eat meat, although perhaps once a week or less.  But the treatment of workers is absolutely abhorrent.  Perhaps they should do away with the subsidizes to the big "farmers".  I don't care if it makes meat costs $100 a lb because the "corporate farmers" know that they will never sell it at that price point.
The octopus
So office workers get a nice workout and the actual workers are still working.
How much more shit do you need to hear about this industry in order to go vegan? Animal cruelty, environmental pollution, consumer health risks, inhumane working conditions, ... Try a beyond burger ffs...
Excellent work as usual John -- esp reminding us all that, no, the super fucked up thing you just heard about is not an exception to the rule, it is very much in line with the rest of the country.
I lost the family f-bomb pool this week, only eight. Come on  John, I need you to up your game.
We must,  quickly, and without ducking patience, understand that any nooormal human being would,  obviously, choose to eat worms before signing onto what I plainly portraid as being NOT cool. blah blah blah.
Everton 2, liverpool 0
Wouldn't it be edifying to compare working conditions in European meat/chicken processing plants? Something tells me Germany's, for example, runs circles around ours.

The Jungle 2: Electric Boogaloo
John Oliver is the kind of socialism this world deserves. But USA won't understand and USA control the world, except that the wotld never asked for that.
This was very disturbing. I was hoping he'd tell us what we can do. I can eat less meat. But I suppose I can call my legislators but I kinda feel powerless too since I don't have the same kind of cash these corporations do to buy Congressmen.
Mom loves your show
If you look closely, you can literally see Bill gates and plant based meats hand up Johns butt working his mouth
4:29 John's wife is going to hurt him once she sees he's using a dating app. Poor guy.
These companies don't care about the animals, so why would they care about the workers? The meat industry is the largest bloodbath holocaust to ever plague the planet, yet meat eaters call vegans extreme.
You would be talking about packing meat ya sleezy brit.
Why is this on my feed?...I specifically asked for non-douche content.  John Oliver is definitely of the douch canoe variety.
what if we, I don't know, democratized industry
You can choose your friends but you can't choose your "family"...
Nothing new! Trump and his cronies made sure his "constituents" got paid. The majority of Americans saw through the lies and the " get back to work and keep stocks high" mentality.
Could easily/should totally do a segment on how important/ineffective OSHA is.
Is it possible to block channels? I'm tired of seeing this guy in my feed.
I'm pretty sure most places make you work like a machine. Hell I worked at Krogers in the Deli and I had to do more work that was physically possible, and be in literally more then one place at a time, in the span of 2-3 hours.
Namaste
How does your show even work?  I watch it for free on YouTube, uninterrupted with any advertisements (so I have to assume you pay for no ads, because I could watch another 20-minute video from someone with 1 subscriber and still suffer through 9 or 10 ads)... and then you make me angry about something that I want to change, but you don't tell me how to change it.  You don't even give me an easy fundraising link that I can throw money at and feel like I did something.  HOW ARE YOU SUCCESSFUL?  (Also, keep up the good work.)
...18:41 follow the standards for sanitary prevention and cook the meat thoroughly well and avoid raw meat if you want to... Perdure in this life or try to raise your own stock; what a sad hard effusive system to live in!!!!
"Employees have to work in their own urine" = society is outraged Animals are forced to live in cages so small they can't move, and just one consequence is that they get infected chemical burns from sitting on their own/others urine = society says this is fine.
We cannot willfully support large conglomerates that ignore basic human rights.
When are we going to stop comparing worker’s rights to socialism? Why do some of us think that wanting the right to medical treatment makes you a commie?
Dude the EXACT SAME FUCKING THING HAPPENED IN THE LATE 1800s. If any country demonstrates insanity, it’s this one.
Osha is a fucking joke
Feels like classic journalism. So refreshing. Good job last week team.
But we want tons of chicken & we want it fast!
Say John, could you switch the free youtube clip to the first half of the show?  That part is far more entertaining and faaaaar less "I don't want to live on this planet anymore" depressing.  :(
You know what? It is how it is. Want to change it? Want to really change it? Don't go to work.  "But if I don't go to work, someone else will."  Yeah thats the problem. You need to gather people behind you. Many MANY people. Like: Thousands. Hundred thousands. Millions.  Why do the rich get richer? Because we play their game.  Don't want to play their game? Stop going to work by their conditions. Everyone who is affected by shitty treatment/payment/working conditions. Stop working.  And everyone who needs work and fill in the gaps: Don't go working either. Stand side by side.  Thats how people showed the elite the middle finger. Atleast the past few hundred years. Band together.  Remember Free Hong Kong? Remember George Floyd? Remember Nawalny? Remember the protest against abortions in poland?  They will all be forgotten. Cause nobody cares if millions go demonstrate. Because that millions wont go on demonstrations 3 months from now on.  Because they still attend their work. And going to work, being workforce - thats important. Nobody cares about your opinions and what you vote on as long as you go to work and are part of the system, everything is fine. And even if you don't go to work - company just finds someone else.   As we have a famous worker song in Germany that goes:  "Mann der Arbeit, aufgewacht! Und erkenne deine Macht! Alle Räder stehen still, Wenn dein starker Arm es will."  Translates into:  "Working man wake up! and realise your might! all the wheels will stop turning! if your strong arm wants them to!"   But yeah I guess those times are over.
When I'm done with my nuggies i will write quite the scathing letter
man this bullshit osha needs to step its game up. because if they are letting this shit slide what about other industries. I work in steel, I'm a welder, and this video made me feel a lot less safe.
"No one should be treated like a machine!"  Unless, of course, you're a cow.
You guys just rock. Absolutely 💯 the only place I want to work.
Because the American people want cheap "food" no one is pushing the government to change these big businesses and their lobbying practices.

Hmm..., smells like Capitalism!
Truth!
where can i find that perdue farms video?  i tried to find it but no luck, did they delete it from the internet like they did with betty white and her mothers day clip from snl?
Think about how many problems we would solve if we didn’t eat meat
..."the cluck stops here"?  kind of disgusting.
Quality over quantity. And yes, in that environment there would be higher possibility and probability of contraction.
how else do you think they can keep the poor, poor and the rich. rich
CAN CONFIRM. Went to school 🏫 n a town here in Virginia with a few Tyson and Purdue plants. ALL immigrant labor, and they all come outside to smoke and break at the same time. They literally all have bandages and bandaids on the same or different parts of them. The smell? Coming off these plants in the hot 100 degree sun? Un fucking real.
This is why you got to support your local butcher and grocer.
Not looking forward to $50. a pound chicken
I worked for meijer for 5 years and there were pently of rules the that company broke
The phrase "Tantamount to slavery", comes to mind.
Its funny how closely this resembles working in other factories. In the USA. And exactly the same way the corporate side area and the amenities for the employees its night and day. Even oddly the same in the case of ethnicity on factory side vs salaried side. Its the way companies are run and they emulate each other most of the time. Company A borrows from what company B is doing and this must be the corporate model for some. I always thought it was pretty despicable how the corporate office which was right next door was much less of a slave environment and they complain about sitting in their desk. Those people getting carpal tunnel and back pains from remaining in the same position would love to have a yoga/meditation session. Tbh on the line its almost meditative bc youre doing the same thing over and over and lost in thought most of the time, i bet the mental explorations of people are a little different than on the cubicle side as far as im concerned they ARE the ones who need to meditate. But seriously they have better cafeterias,  they get better views while working, start working later than line workers, go home earlier, and some offices have fucking bikes to ride around coffee machines etc etc this place i was at had fucking a VR theatre or something. Plus alllllll the people on corp side just seemed better off and less fucked. You look at the factory workers coming into work its immigrants and other odd bunches of people filled via staffing agencies who get paid more than the workers.
Eat food from a butcher you get to see the chic die in front of you
everyone throw me a subscribe its not gon hurt you man 😞
Somewhere between the two sides of this scary story is the truth
What a sick and disgusting reality we live in. Capitalism makes me nauseous🤠
Number 2 passed the phone last week for me in Texas lol
Easy eat Halal
Glad to see that we haven't evolved much from the publication of Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle" in 1906...
`` FREE HONG KONG ~ FREE UIGHUR ~
Oliver , you should be an anchor in MSNBC, CNN and or any other mass media org. Should be the news main voice saying this things  all the time and in time. And you should be forgiven any cursing and bad language.
Could just stop buying meat from junk companies........
Horrible show.
I'm only a minute in and can't believe as a British born man you missed the holy hand grenade joke there in that ad. It was so ripe for a Python reference it hurt
General strike. All industries. All workers. It doesnt have to be this way and it won't change unless collectively we make it.
People miss the point here just as they did when the Jungle was published. It’s about the corruption of capitalism. I worked in factories for over forty years and was an active unionist for thirty eight of them.
This show should be called "Symptoms of capitalism, the root of all these troubles that we will never mention directly"
'the race to the bottom will just continue....'  Seems to be a universal truth
John Olivers highest value ranking: 1. Phone 2. food, water, and shelter 3. Judi Dench 4. family Who hurt you John? We're here for you if you need to talk
as for the commercial   i thought it was a lil ceaser pizza one    and as for the story    well if u want cheap meat   its gonna come from somewhere
Aaaaand that’s why I raise my own chickens!
Holy shit, I’ve never felt more confident about my decision to stop eating meat.
man's not even funny any more but replaced it with straight fax
Well hes absolutely right in regards to Tyson I was refused employment because I pissed dirty for my psychotropic meds I had to quit my meds to get a job....i also developed carpal tunnel while working there my wrist swelled up to the size of a golf ball just placed on my wrist they told me if I ever went to a doctor they would fire me and sue but it's the best paying job around and the shady arseholes know it
it so sad how im getting desensitized about this really horrendous abuses, because i see so much of it. Still very shocking how there is people so evil and greedy in this world.
As someone who relies heavily on meat to get adequate nutrition this is just insulting to me. They don't understand the value of the workers. The white-collar workers will go home at the end of a long day and enjoy a steak or chicken salad not thinking about where it came from, who really put it on their table. It's not just a job, these people provide an important service that shouldn't be taken for granted and they should be allowed to do it safely.
Reason why Black Folks wash meat before eating it @5:00
Everything about slaughterhouses is evil from animal abuse to workers treated like crap and all meat-eaters finance this billion-dollar industry.
John "the Jungle" Oliver. History repeating.
Friend of mine worked at a bird seed plant. They would have to do dangerous work that would go against their companies "policies", they would be coerced to work unpaid overtime, they GOT COVID from work. And did OSHA ever catch anything? No. Because any time that they knew that they were going to be inspected, THEN they were told to follow policy.
I worked in a meat department and had MRSA virus multiple times and on a couple occasions and blood poison on on occasion. I felt I still had to work even though it was life threatening. I wont work meat department again.
But keep letting in the 3rd world and get the 3rd world assholes
Haha where's the original treasure, Adam Driver. Cmon man.
Amazon  runs  their  fulfillment  centers similarly
16:37 If Meatpacking employees were given bathroom breaks as nonbillable time, they would lose more than 0.00003% of their yearly earnings on a single trip. The average American salary is $31,133; 0.00003% of $31,133 is $0.93, or less than 4 minutes of labor at the roughly equivalent wage of $15 an hour; and I'm pretty sure they're not even making $15 an hour.
I used to work for someone who was married to a nurse at JBS. They treated a woman who had a finger cut off like she did it on purpose for money. They were horrid to her.
you know what.. i like chicken and fish but after watching this i’m really ok with vegetables/fruit 🥦🌽🥑🥒🍉🍓🥥
I really hope  they find justice for these people 😳 this world is shit!!!
Any business, manager, or person in a position of leadership referring to their workers or subordinates as “family” should be an immediate red flag for everyone.  It’s not family. It’s a business. Any claim otherwise is propaganda. It’s manipulation. It’s an attempt to blur the line between two fundamentally different concepts.  Workers are not, and should not be, family. That’s not their function, and blurring those lines reinforces the conservative notion that families, like businesses, should have a hierarchical structure.  It is a lie. Do. Not. Buy it.
Finally no trump ... i can enjoy the show again
How about some links in the video summary to support groups doing something about the stories you report on? Feel like this episode wasn't much different than the local media show John was ripping into, commenting on how disgusting it is and then moving on.
For those who say immigrants should leave this country... This is for you. Immigrants are willing to do things Americans will never think of
This hit a little too close to home because my mom works at a turkey processing plant and everyone working there gets treated like trash. Last year, a 29yo man was working and one of the hooks that holds the turkey on the assembly line caught onto his jaw and pulled him along the assembly line until his skull got crushed by a thick pole that is stood about 3 inches away from the assembly line. When the man died, the supervisors ushered all of the workers outside to avoid giving any witness testimonies to the police. Many people have died in that specific spot and the company has done nothing to remove that pole that has caused the death of so many. I've heard so many horror stories from my mom that it makes me want to have her to retire already. It's caused her so many injuries in her hands and back from standing up for so long but she hasn't reached the age requirement yet 😔. Don't buy any chicken or turkey from Foster Farms.
It's almost like consuming meat at present scale in our global economy isn't sustainable or ethical in any way 🤷
The Plant Manager organizing a cash buy-in, winner-take-all betting pool for supervisors and managers to see who would get COVID-19 is something that frats have done! Not a joke!
America is disgusting
The same solution to John Oliver's video last week (the next pandemic) can be applied to this video: eat a lot less meat
Thanks for taking the time to expose the horrors hiding behind a pretty label and packaging in the grocery store.
Lmao the machine is rising
Dont forget that these companies got AID money from the government last year.... tRicKLe dOwN eCoNomY wOrKS. SMH
Ummm... nobody has died FROM Covid.
American Exceptionalism
Why do I feel like I as a single individual would get fined more for doing shit like this!?
“robot f-🦆 a soup” 😂 😂 😂
imagine worrying about human workers but not giving 2 shits about the animals being abused and killed for your food  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQRAfJyEsko
Why is there a world war? This question should be asked to the old capitalist empire! Britain! Because Germany wants to build a railway from Berlin to Baghdad! 2B railway! End British maritime hegemony! So the British launched a world war! Attack Germany!
The medical care sounds remarkably similar to prison! The solution is transparency. Publish the names of the companies who don't get inspected properly. Probably the best thing to do. As long as corporations run our government, we can't expect anything better.
lol just go vegan already you noobs
I know its not a great opinion but you know you can get a different job right?
I miss you so much!!!
I have no doubt some people watching this will have no problem with what they watched and more problems with what they heard from you, will say things like more regulation will increase the price of meat like paying .30 more cents for some chicken will ruin their lives or something, unlike the actual lives that these companies are ruining. Keep up the good work on educating us on things these rich fucks are trying to keep hidden!
17:24 so, what can we do here? Me: burn the whole plant down and kill all the big bosses/CEOs. My brain: *people would go to jail for this* Me: oh okay, then protest on a daily basis and boycott the products from that plant until they pay the families of the dead ones a decent amount of money.
Nothing will change,The big corporations will continue to suck the lives out of our eyes only to gain more profits in order to keep their investors happy.Again...Absolutely nothing will change.
Considering our country’s habit of arming various groups, maybe we should arm OSHA.
This sounds similar to the conditions I had to work with in Chipotle. You were not allowed to use the restroom when the line was long and they gave you unrealistic expectations to finish batches of food within a specific timeframe. They also never gave anyone a break if you worked less than 5 hours, even though they would put you on the schedule for 4.83 hours. You were not allowed to leave until the line went down and it usually did after 5 hours, so you would end up working 5 hours without a break.
Slavery, rebranded.
The best thing you can do about this is vote with your wallet - don't support the meat packing industries. Ween into it with meatless Mondays and fish Fridays. Such a cruel industry,  from the treatment of the animals to the treatment of its meat packing workers throughout all the associated companies.
Nobody should be treated like a machine unless it's adam driver, that musky, meaty machine of a marvelous man
I thought with the title and the ad you were going to talk about the early days of meat packing where rats were put in meat
Zero sympathy for those who are part of the massive killing of animals. Cry me an effing river.
Holy shit has it finally happened? Has this show gone back to being funny again and dropped its political hardon? Thanks!!
So...anyone want to start a betting pool one who's going to try suing Last Week Tonight next?   Cause I feel like the meat industry might get a little grumpy about this one
ah the time when politicians had some integrity
does anyone know what kind of tie John's wearing?
Dame Judi Dench
I worked in the meat industry for almost a year. It was a pain in the butt
OSHA HAS BECOME A JOKE. Not kidding. No one fears OSHA.
So it's basically "The Jungle" but part 2.
Darn this video crushed my soul.  No hope for America
I lost half of my right foot in a pork processing plant. And to this day, I wish I'd never took that job. Disability Sux!!!
I am glad that he brought this up. Working conditions in these places are cruel and unsafe.
Bet they are going to try to automate chicken processing before they give workers any benefits
Really surprised that these jobs haven’t been automated.
Was this supposed to be funny? I didn't laught once
The Green Bay Meatpackers
John Oliver is a meatpacker.
Seems like whatever benefit Upton Sinclair's The Jungle produced has been lost.
I thought this was going to be about sex workers.
Meat packing industry is as bad as it was in the 1880s and that’s fucking challenging.
Jon Oliver be like: I heard you were enjoying life for a second there, here’s why you fucking shouldn't.
I always wonder whether world leaders watch this.
Absolutely True:      Judi Dench IS a f*@king treasure, Sir!
I can whole heartedly say its this bad in Ireland too.
Thanks, John... now I want to try ranch-flavored chicken chips...
My favorite actually funny British guy.
114 years ago, Upton Sinclair published The Jungle, describing how bad the working conditions in meatpacking facilities were. It caused such disgust and outcry that it lead to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 which itself created the FDA. It wasn't until the 1970s that widespread worker protection laws became the norm with OSHA. So why the hell are we letting this happen? We have laws for shit like this.
The only thing this episode has revealed is that John Oliver has never worked a real job in his life...lol
John Oliver prove that Covid-19 started in those companies also those people could of contracted it from outside work. These companies cannot control your movements outside work and should not be responsible for people dying of a pandemic everyone was new to this....
Fun fact: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a response to the meatpacking industry.
I'm sensing a re-occuring theme going on: Ground force is treated like shit and is expected to break themselves (often times literally) for the company, while the executives at the "office" relax in their figurative jacuzzies. I know people demonize socialism a lot, but I ain't smelling roses here either chief.
we live in such a dystopian time
"Bathroom brakes aren't excusable" says Amazon (and industry in general)
Don't worry the workers won't have to worry about bad conditions for much longer.... Robots are coming!
This show is stupid and never recomend this liberal trash to me ever again yt.
When I saw this, I thought of The Jungle by Upton Sinclair.
I've never really noticed how much cults and corporations use the same play book.  We're family you don't need to go outside the family for help.
The only meatpacking John approves of is between him and Adam Driver
Seems like things in meatpacking really haven't changed much since The Jungle by Uptun Sinclar
I'm convinced.  I'm not buying Tyson, ever again.  And writing to my governor about OSHA
2,400 downvotes, must be the combined vote of the owners and office staff from all of these plants.
I live in Iowa, and Waterloo is one of the more diverse towns here, so of course the Tyson plant there exploits that to the company's benefit and the community's peril.
Yet nothing will change... people in power who do try to better something is always challenged by others in power who are against it. Nothing in the US gets done.
this is what happens when the unions are busted by corporations
Out of all the things John Oliver has said over the years I think “Robot f*ck a soup yes please” should be is epitaph
This is some crazy "stuff"
John, sir, I'm so pleased to watch your show and not hear about the x pres. Bravo! Always you are informative and entertaining.
Why is this even happening? What will be done? what do we do about this?
This prang is such a Tory he would have thrown out in 1774.  Why does this kommie live here anyway?
Don't push for more Osha please. They are annoying enough on construction sites.
I remember when i saw a documentary of these meat nazi sweatshops i stopped eating meat and poultry the same day...
Over the years I have trained myself to think about the horrendous conditions of meat packing workers AS WELL as the poor animals everytime I crave chicken, beef or pork from fast food or low quality packaged meats.  It wasnt easy and took some effort, but now I can see someone eating bacon and all I hear is the sound of a chunky pink pig squealing and a baby chick getting his male parts ripped off.  Ill do without the protein caloric intake of poorly treated animals and take me some good ol' inexpensive vegetables and fruits instead. xD  Side note: America should know by now that unless you're an athlete or someone that requires heavy animal fats, the introduction of the FDA saying that we need daily meat to be healthy is total BS. It represents their OWN interests, not ours.
whose surprised that capitalism has lead to whats essentially indentured servitude, America needs to be socialized.
Then they threaten to go overseas to abuse those people there
I know it would cut down on some jobs, but is there a reason why some of the most dangerous tasks in these plants can't be completed by machines?
One of my favorite things about my work place is that none of the various managers up the chain of command have ever said; "We're family".
Note to self-Never order chicken fingers, ever.
Ay my dad and uncle worked at the waterloo plant at that time.
you guys are really back. soo cool
This is like every major company now though. Big Lots, Wal-Mart... Treat employees like shit while corporate lives big.
You know this all applies to just about ANY food packing.
The root of this is corporate greed and the same old political corruption of many other issues in the US and around the world.
as long as capitalists are able to lobby their way out of responsibility, nothing in this country is going to change
In this entire 18 minute video John Oliver doesn't mention the solution to these problems: unions.
Who...who tf gives guinea pigs milk??? Is that even safe? Tf
we are the true shithole country
No more Tyson products
if you run a company who profits from death, the least you will be is a cynical low life humanoid.
XD XD XD
Oiiiiil
you are that perverter owl
Ever work in the industry ? Then you have no idea what youre talking about.  You have no idea how dire the situation is . The only solution is not to eat meat. Exactly what the left wants
I think it is really good that you draw attention to the negative things in the US. The US patrioty blinds many US Americans so they say this phrase "this is not my country" and get biased by patriotism and nationalism. It is very important to recognize problems as problems in the country, accept that it several concerns it is not the number A example to the world, in order to target the problems and solve them. I think you guys really need solid worker protection. In Germany companies are not allowed to just fire workers from today to tomorrow. The details could surely be done better but I am very happy that we actually have ways to defend ourselfs when this happens. But these conditions also exist here for foreigners who work here. Sad thing when firm exploit their workers.
Automate the industry. Problem solved.
Has anyone got any Dead Rising flashbacks? Given how poor the meat industry is treated in this country. Also how there's an outbreak right now with Covid-19. WOW, it's bad.
Holy shit I hate this
MURDERERS!  please stop them!
One of the reasons I've specifically gone vegetarian is to not support this terrible terrible industry.
This piece and last week’s are two prime examples of why someone should go vegan/vegetarian.
>employee: "oh I've cut myself with the edge of the meatgrinder" >corporate: "OK, get in"
You all still eating meat are guilty too, not as guilty as corporations are but if you don't buy they don't sell. You can still eat meat that's lab made and one day not cancer inducing which is way better, just stop supporting what created this pandemic and worse pandemics to come please
omg
Someday the corporation you work for will deduct from your paycheck a fee that will allow you to be buried in the company graveyard when you die at work.
USA is a 3rd world conformed
I’ve worked in a turkey processing plant. It was fast paced hard work, and long hours for little pay. Not to mention nasty and smelly.
I replaced Judi Dench with Betty White
where i work in alaska osha will give a 10,000$ fine for every extension cord they see with broken sheathing, so yeah its pretty messed up that they have no power in meat packing facilities.
If this guy ever said anything that was objectively true it would be concerning. But all he ever does is spin carefully selected out of context non facts to fit a narrative and world view that brainwashed fools will eat up. Millions of brainwashed mouth breathing morons and YOU are one of them.
In short sentence, looks like modern day slavery alledgedly.
Also, all four beef packing companies are facing a lawsuit for manipulating the price of domestic beef prices for direct purchasers such as large groceries which led to the cost to rise on the consumer.
Petition to make: dividing by 0 = a fraction of a fuck
1,1K people simping for the "poor" meatpacking magnates.
I’m guessing The Jungle by Upton Sinclair is completely irrelevant now
Why I only buy organic local meats
7:31 😂🍻 my one and only news anchor next to Ron Burgundy of course. Keep it up John!!!!
If you roast Kroger I'll willingly quit working for them
Hello
I was once nibbling on a mixed meat hot dog(chicken, pork, ?).  A friend saw this and said" you know I make those right?"  He worked at the local chicken plant.  I'll briefly describe what he said:  Do you know what mechanically separated chicken means?  Basically what ever goes into the grinder. Necks, gizzards, crap-so so much crap.  If it falls on the floor, in the hopper it goes.  Now they tried to keep poo out of it, but it all goes so fast, it  happens. Meat kinda looked green..  The next bit still gets me.       Since most batches contained massive amounts  of S$#t. They had to wear respirators, and cook off the ammonia. Was that toxic to breath in!    Of course there were plant inspectors, a USDA guy-etc.  Everyone knew what went on in the separating department.  "Just one of those things".     This "meat" goes into all of your cheapest  products.   Now I'm certain higher end, better brand, products use a better quality ingredients, and methods than this plant.      Have you ever bit into a chicken nugget, and seen some green? Hmm, wonder what it is?.....
@2:25...  Unless you're Vin Diesel
If you eat meat you're part of this problem.
John Oliver. What can I do? I have no money, where can I volunteer my time?
dis in china?
Nothing nevera family
Where my vegans at?
Corruption!! Most of the problems in the USA are caused by the corruption of your politicians!!
Meat packing plants aren't the only large corporations ignoring worker safety. When I worked at an Amazon warehouse and developed tinnitus from working next to incredibly loud machines 12 hours a day during "peak season", I reported my injury to HR. They had a company affiliated physician's assistant examine me and he refused to sign off on worker's comp. Why? Because I couldn't prove that I didn't have tinnitus prior to working there - I hadn't previously gone to a hearing specialist to be tested.   Who goes to a specialist to be tested for a condition that you know you don't have?   A year later, when I became permanently disabled due to neck and back injuries caused by non-ergonomic work stations, lifting requirements, and speed requirements, I didn't even try to go through worker's comp. Amazon has more lawyers than God and their workers will never have decent working conditions unless they unionize - something that Amazon hires union-busting companies to derail.
Does anyone int he comments know humane meat brands I can look up?
What's really going on in the world
That AD has to be illegal in every country.
Absolutely Fucked Up Honestly Do better. People are more CONCERNED money than welfare crazy.
Fucked up and I bet nobody will do a thing about it. Having to wear diapers to work... Like how is this even possible in civilized country in 21.Century...?
Hey Zazoo... STF up... nobody cares what you say...
Another episode about the conditions in farms for things like quinoa would be good, a lot of people argue veganismis better because animals and humans arent exploited, but its very much not true
Worked for Butterball. Had a heart attack on line. They sent me to the hospital. They fired me when I was cleared to return to work. Told me it was because of "No call, no show". Talked to local lawyers. Was told I would lose since I signed some agreement stating I must call in. Kind of hard to do in the hospital but hey, they win.
Many comments about a book named the jungle. I guess its timw to google it and give it a read
Trust me fellas....before the millennials hit retirement, the world will see a first civil unrest movement against capitalism.
I'm really surprised that the end screen links to the *Workplace Sexual Harassment* episode and not the *Chicken* episode from early in the show. Heck, I'm surprised that John never referenced the *Chicken* episode.
I remember my dad telling me that if I wanted results, I shouldn't bother reporting to OSHA. I should report it to their insurance instead because that they'll care about.
AND THAT OSHA OWRKER SHOULD HAVE BLOWN THE LIUDEST WHISTLE CHINA WOULD OF HEARD IT.
I want brownie points to!!!! Ok....Things r bad.  Thank you thank you oh no im not a hero thank you king no im just a liberal
The only way you'll make The Suits care is if you slap with Life in Prison or the Death Penalty for their callousness.

I've worked at these beef plants. Alot of truth in this video. I hated having to argue with my supervisor for something as simple as a bathroom break. They would say train yourself to go on break or lunch. Breaks were about 5-7 minutes after you took all the equipment off and then put it back on. Lunch breaks were bad also I felt the need to damn near swallow my food whole so I can hurry and get back so I wouldn't be written up. Anytime you complained about pain they would slap some icy hot or ice on the area and send you back to work. I will never ever go back to those working conditions and feel sorry for the people that still work there.
I used to work in meatpacking and this video hits so close to home. The government regulating keeps getting pushed out further and further. People are treated horribly in these facilities.
JOHNNNNNNY RELAX CAN YOU T ELL US THINGS A LITTLE SLOWER PLSSSS
Not surprising how a company treat employees when they treated none human lives the same way. On a corporate level outside of the food industry, they are all the same.
Let’s not forget that these companies have massive amounts of lobbyists profiting off of them
America, terrorizing other races since they forcibly took the land 👌
The amount of effort Texas is putting in to be a shitty state for workers and recruit businesses from all over the US’s ‘liberal’ states is impressive.
828-755-7135
Used to watch these and think they were funny and witty. Now all I see is  a sad and narrow attack infomercial... such a sided and directed narrative.
...and yet we keep eating all these critters.
Truck drivers often have to wear diapers to avoid having to stop to use the toilet and risk being fined for not making delivery on time
The world b4 covid19 was just crap, some industries were worse but the pandemic just made it obvious that the rich people running the world matter more than anyone. Anglo American is one of the best companies bcos of safety first (but I couldn’t join a union of my choice) so it sucks to be working class! And that’s what it is
Don't work there. Simple as that.
Good job John
In 1906 Upton Sinclair wrote the book "The Jungle" where he exposed the cruel treatment of mostly immigrant workers in meatpacking plants in Chicago and other industrial cities.  It led to the creation of the FDA. Perhaps the Biden administration should consider putting more teeth back into the FDA.    The more things change the more they remain the same.
two words UNDER DURESS
Oh gosh, i'm glad i live in a country where health and safety inspection can happen by surprise and with a full check ; And in case problems are observed, fines are heavy.. Glad to not live in the most powerfull third world country.
So true JBS is a shitty company. When they took over the pork plant in my hometown (Ottumwa, IA) they cut line jobs and then sped up the lines to try to recover their 1.4 billion dollar purchas of Cargill's pork production facilities. They have yet to slow them down.
oh my god the people that still watch these shows
thank god your back!!!!
Wasn't this exactly the topic of the Jungle by Upton Sinclair? In freaking 1906?
We don’t need to know the details of your private life dude
And they wonder why people become criminals.
That's why McChicken is so cheap.
Guys.. GUYS... Someone needs to tell Jamie Oliver to speak slower if anyone wants to take him seriously.
As always, John Oliver answering the question no one is asking but I guess we should be
When he was talking about things higher on the food chain, I was expecting Adam Driver...
Hey JO! Love you man!
Cant these companies unionize?
And yet, these companies will pay millions to lobbyist and attorneys to keep from paying workers compensation and medical expenses.
if you want to see a real problem, LastWeekTonight, look at the plant-fields. find the tomatos plucker. the actual guys on the field, who have to take the plants out of the soil, because maschines cant take them out. you know.....the actual illegal immigrants. and than test covid in their living areas. you dont get news from these facilities, because meatpacking facilities cant hide the dirt. the plants-packing facilities hide the dirt sucessfull.
Just started the video, and in case it's not mentioned in the video at all... go vegan!
Maddow has been reporting this story throughout the pandemic...
As bad as placing bets on how many of your workers are going to get sick is, 280/57,543 is less than half of one percent mortality rate...... Just saying.
Dr. Sanjay Gupta said that the next pandemic will be in the meat-packing industry . . . .
So several years ago I needed to go to physical therapy for some misc. issues off and on for a while - at our local hospital.. While there I kept hearing in a distant office" step up, and down , now lift, and drop" . This went on for a couple of minutes.  Several times.  I then asked what was going on back there.  A physical therapist said "Oh thats the fitness exam for the local chicken plant". It is a timed test lifting a box, while bending & moving to see if the plants workers are well enough to return to work.   Basically it was there to weed out all but the most crippled from getting further help & benefits..  In her words" to see if they were faking it or not".  Its not like this was the last part of recovery, most often when a new arrival from the plant came due to a injury- this is the first test to see how hurt are they.    In other words if you could move well enough,  you weren't hurt.    Seemed like a pop quiz, most didn't see it coming.  Id say this was what the plant payed for.  Since most new little english, and had no health care.  No one thought anything of it...
It is illegal to fire someone that is under a doctors care.
I've got news for you. Some workers in other industries will piss right where they stand because they are lazy and think no one is watching. Nothing to do with not being allowed bathroom breaks.
Could also try veganism and then none of this would be an issue...
My x husband worked at a meat packing company cut himself contracted mad cow and died.  The co closed and the CDC never responded to my correspondents. it is a disease that kills one in a million there had to of been a hot spot because the city only has under 600,00 residents but there were 7 cases within a two year period.
Workers in vaccine factories have to wear diapers! These Corporations have got to be reined in! How about hiring more FDA, OSHA, Ag and IRS staff?
We are all guilty, we want meat and chicken no matter what and deaths are the price we pay.
I live in a state where Tyson and Purdue are king. Unfortunately I also live in a state where the highest paying job you'll find with a high school diploma is walmart or a chicken plant...
Don't see what the issue is, seems like family to me.  My family stole $10k from me and tried to kill me when I was 16.
“America is the greatest country in the world!! Hell yeah!!!” Greatest at fucking it’s poor citizens over and over again. The minimum wage isn’t really a wage, it’s just a means so companies won’t have to call them slaves... I mean, a job at McDonalds in Sweden for a young first time worker pays almost double in comparison to US.
Who all had a Deja vu moment at the "nobody should be treated like a machine"?
Meat packing companies do not have Unions?  They need an ombud as well
It's strange that school shootings is so common in the U.S, it sounds that workplace shootings should be waaaayyy more common, I know I'd want to kill my boss if I was working in those conditions.
Grrr sickening.
Unfortunately is not only the meat industry that treats their employees like crap, from what I've witness it's also the plastics  factories and nut factories, (also in Texas). Those factories also have some  disgusting things going on.  Just want to put in out there, hopefully bring some awareness to people.
Rebucklican's completely endorse this. People are expendable, and money is sparse in the million dollar world. Billionaire's that actually hear this from their butlers or PR are laughing at this commentary.
You can help fight the meat industry by choosing to eat plants rather than animals. Going vegan is easier than you think.
The tyson plant in my home county in Indiana was also a hotspot for covid back in the beginning. My dad used to work for these companies. Im so appalled at how horrible people can be.
The real reason we allow illegal immigration. Did you think it was b/c we sympathized? You offer corporations illegal employees, you're going to get illegal working conditions. The illegal labor dries up, then they're forced to raise standards.
You know what would help with all those mistreatments of workers in the US? Unions. Proper Unions who have power. It sure as hell works for many wealthy European countries.
From someone who worked at a Tyson plant, this is absolutely spot on. I can't even explain how bad conditions can be at these places and I not sure I want to.
I can’t believe this is happening in this country.. Corrupt politicians supported by Greedy Industrialists  is the cause of worker exploitation.. A well informed society (public) can stop this in the future & I believe a good education system can is the base to every thing..
Some people in this country like to say that immigrants, particularly Mexicans, will take your jobs.  Seriously, how many U.S. citizens are willing to work in one of those meat processing plants?
low IQ jobs low skill jobs and they complaining lol
You should read the book every twelve seconds its about a slaughter house.  Its despicable the way the workers and the animals are treated.
We really need our own version of the French Revolution, but instead of the guillotine, people should be drawn and quartered so anyone in the future who considers doing this again will be scared shitless by the consequences of their actions.
Welcome to America Mr. Oliver. Where big business owns OUR/YOUR government. Period. Not enough staffing at OSHA? You can bet big business persuaded YOUR/local, state and federal governments, the people YOU voted for, to reduce OSHA's budget. In fact, decades ago, I saw exactly what you are talking about, news articles how local/state governments were reducing OSHA's budget. Decades ago.   Dear Mr. Oliver. Great information. But. Americans don't give a sh*t. I've seen news information like this 30/40 years ago. I'm guessing, probably 99% of Americans could care less about how employees are treated, how animals are treated. As long as the products they are buying continue to sell at low prices. They don't care. Americans are some of the most self-centered people I have ever seen. And I've lived in three countries, and visited many. But again, great information. Your team does a great job.
Pets go above family John.
Go vegan and you can eliminate all of this...
Yep, all because you want to have unregulated open borders, so there is always a new warm body to take the place of a worker, drive down wages nation wide and prevent unionization.
I used to be a federal meat inspector in the large high speed beef slaughter establishments in SW Kansas. My plants that I inspected at  ran an average of 375-390 beef an hour. They don't treat the line inspectors any better than the plant workers. Years later, I've lost 30% of the function of my left hand that operates a node hook to check lymph nodes. My right hand, my dominant hand and my knife hand goes numb a lot. We lost federal meat inspectors to from COVID-19 and I knew one of the ones who died who inspected at Dodge City, KS. If you want to jump us for line speed, don't blame the ones who inspect on the line, blame Dr. Elizabeth Hagen and Paul Kieker, the heads of USDA FSIS. I remember in order to get through a nights kill of 2700 beef, I'd take 8 ibuprofen, 3 Adderall and that was before dinner. Before the second half, wash, rinse, repeat. I'd come home so sore that I'd scream in my sleep. My dreams were of the line. I'd work 10-11 hr days six days a week and would only bring home 1400 every two weeks. Welcome to hell. It's not just pork and poultry.
All this stuff needs to be automated.
I would love to believe that this country could do better but our politicians will sooner vacation in Cancun during state wide emergencies than lift a finger to help us
The meat industry is terrible in so many ways. Please don't support it! There are marvelous vegan versions of virtually every type of food imaginable. All of then nutrients we need in order to thrive can be obtained more healthfully, humanely, and environmentally responsibly from plant sources - and deliciously, too!
R.E.M already warned us Decades ago with a tune  "It's The End of the World as We Know It"....
YES IT IS
Cant believe they exploit imigrants like that , they know they can't complain to anyone
“preventable diseases kill off half our population. And even if science were allowed to try, it could do little, because the majority of human beings are not yet human beings at all, but simply machines for the creating of wealth for others. They are penned up in filthy houses and left to rot and stew in misery, and the conditions of their life make them ill faster than all the doctors in the world could heal them; and so, of course, they remain as centers of contagion, poisoning the lives of all of us, and making happiness impossible for even the most selfish. For this reason I would seriously maintain that all the medical and surgical discoveries that science can make in the future will be of less importance than the application of the knowledge we already possess, when the disinherited of the earth have established their right to a human existence.” ― Upton Sinclair, The Jungle

Stopping just short of telling everyone to stop buying meat till these plants got their "family" business in order because no law suit hurts more than the one from Agriculture.  They sued Oprah, they sure as hell would sue Oliver.
In Germany, one of the biggest outbreaks of COVID was also in a meat packing factory. Not even a coincidence, everyone just treats their meat industry equally shitty, just to have chicken cost $1.
Whalecum back
Bloody hell. Eating meat in the US comes with some seriously questionable background. It's enough to make you turn veggie.
Profits First Safety Last has always been most corporations moto.
my trans ass saw the title and thought of something else
Thank you, John and everyone at Last Week Tonight, for covering stories like this. Love you guys.
your country is a mess
I don't think I ever wanted to see a reboot of Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle" and hopefully I never do again
@11:50 Really makes you wonder why Tesla moved to Texas...
Oh..you dont know the worst of it...there was a major lawsuit in Trussville Alabama over male employees at tyson jerkin off in the chickens...it was filed by female employees at tyson..around 20 yrs ago..true
Come and investigate Nicholas Meats in Loganton. You wanna see hell come on in we'll give you a job lol
Hey John, why don’t you do a story about hunter Biden’s lap top you ugly tool!!
When you brainwash people since they were children, that this is the best there is and every other place in the world is worst, that is exactly what you get. "The worst day in America is the best everywhere else". So nobody complains. Even when 95%  of convictions are not delivered by a jury, nobody complains. When you face bankruptcy because you fell ill and visited a hospital, nobody complains. When the water in the pipes is poisonous, nobody complains. When the insulin your life depends on is sold to you ten and twenty times more expensive than everywhere else, nobody complains.   That is what brainwashing does to people.
"Race to the bottom" implies that we haven't already hit bedrock.   Optimistic.
Eat less meat
If Oliver comes up missing. Tyson did it.
Hey john oliver can you share some of your millions of dollars of wealth to the poor folks that work at meat factories?
20 year's from now it'll be machines 🤖
A shame that not much has changed since Upton Sinclair published The Jungle.
Thank you for covering this topic. Shame on these companies. I am glad I turned plant-based two years ago, I hope others can try it too 💪🏼
Working for corporations is kind of like being in an abusive relationship.
The coincidence of this episode dropping just when I recently started working in a meatpacking factory  Edit: so far, the factory I work in is really good with safety and have supervisor assistants who can step in if someone needs the restroom. The on-site nurse problem is accurate though
I like that he didn't use Judi Dench's royal title.
This is what happens when republicans are allowed to hold office.
Read Joseph Conrad,, those people have always been about themselves,,
I wonder what my union is doing for these folks-I’m a member of UFCW and I work at a grocery store but I know my union represents meatpacking workers as well-I wonder what the conditions are like at union plants
DONT'T WORRY! THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET WILL FIX THIS.  There really is nothing to worry about. The system is working as intended. Those workers are all jsut lazy. It is obvious. There is no class struggle. Now check out this sweet new product to get your mind off of this...
Wtf is this?
BTW Smithfield poultry is Chinese owned. Just saying if you work at a factory with an in house first aid station that is not a good place to be
Lobbying must stop.
treating slaves bad is religous freedom of the masteranimal
Another reason to stop eating meat.
Well chic fil let is doing just fine
I used to work at a turkey processing plant in jasper Indiana years ago, no clue if it's still open. It was hell, and just walking to your work station could be very dangerous. You also only got one free very thin plastic apron a, one set of ear plugs they expected you to tie to your hardhat, cheap arm sleeves to protect you from knives and keep you clean, along with a number other small things that broke easily. And if you wanted to replace them before the week was up, because it was easy for these things to be damaged, you got your pay doct. They are terrible places to work, and they need to be shut down and reworked.
I am guessing the meatpacking companies are located in anti-union, right to work Republican States. The system is not broken it is just fixed for others.
In Germany, we have similar problems with our largest meat producers! High levels of infection among the workers, horrific working conditions and no insight among the company owners. In addition, the workers, mostly Romanians, are still struggling with wage dumping and terrible housing!
So far this year, we're 2 for 2 on LWT circling around the topic of vegetarianism/veganism without actually discussing it.  I'm honestly expecting this to be the first ever LWT season-long plot arc, and its first ever plot twist.  Weeks from now, John will be like, guess what?  Tonight we're gonna not gonna talk about a big problem!  We're gonna talk about a SOLUTION which would directly impact EVERY issue we've talked about this year!  Most of us should be eating a lot less meat!  No, really!  And I'm not even going to be surprised because I respect these people so much.  I decided to start reducing my meat consumption years ago because it's one of the best ways to reduce your individual carbon footprint, and we haven't covered that yet.  And (as many vegans here in the comments have pointed out) there's an animal cruelty angle too.  Farming big mammals for their meat is a really inefficient way to use land and get calories, so it contributes to world hunger.  I've never done much research into the health effects of vegetarianism vs pescatarianism vs veganism, but I'd love to learn about them here!  My point is there's a lot of material here that's right up this show's alley, and I think it would be really cool if we ended up with a big twist like that later on in the season!
I'm only four minutes in and I'm already certain your meat industry is as disgusting as ours. Greetings from Germany.
Welcome to China
💩 🙉🙈👎💩 used to actually love this show
Then the same day this comes out I go to work and pilgrims/JBS tells me that , they aren't going to honor their policy of guaranteed hours. In which if for any reason the plant gets shut down we will still get paid. In texas the snow storm came through and we couldn't work last week then come back to be told we wont be paid and we have to work extra days to make up for the down time. So, expect all these issues to be more abundant in the next month or 2.
go vegan guys
Not me eating meat while Im watching this... yeaaaah this might be the last time for a while
Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle over 100 years ago about similar working conditions in the meat packing industry.
Feels like John Oliver is grasping for opportunities to drop f-bombs. It's almost distracting.
I just realized I didn't eat meat today.
I remembering reading about the awful conditions of meatpacking workplaces in the book "Fast Food Nation" a few years back. I'm surprised it's not talked about as much... love John Oliver for talking about this. I remember reading about a McDonald's meatpacker employee being treated so incredibly bad after being disabled on site(I think something along the lines of being fired without any compensation)... it literally made me cry and i still think about that worker to this day...
That betting pot is in fact surprisingly abhorrent, even though I already had heard of meat plants in the US, but it goes also quite well with the sidebar of the news channel counting COVD cases and deaths. "Ladies and gentlemen, trick question. Knowing that the United States of America accounts for 5% of the world's general population, where do they weigh for 20% of the world population? Is it people in jail, or COVID cases and deaths? Well, the answer was both!"
18:27  - it made me gag in front of my children.
usa is a failed project. disband pls
And let's talk about meat and it's contribution of about 50% of the greenhouse gasses. If we keep (m)eating meat like this, we don't have to worry about the workers, because we all be dead.
meatpacking is when amab drag queens tuck
US never abolished slavery, it took just another form
This is why I don't eat meat or dairy or any animal ag product
Please shut up Oliver. Those of us who actually work in the healthcare field know that covered is a scam. It's a scam Oliver yes it exists. But we haven't had a case of Corona and almost 5 months. At least in the hospital I work at which is the 6th biggest Hospital in the country. So don't play with me little man you're a propagandist some of your videos are well-researched but your main appeal is propaganda that's all it is
Reminds me of Tönnies and others in Germany.
Exactly what's been on everyone's mind lately. Thank you for providing great journalism.
China is a backward country! China has had a cultural revolution! Limit the rights of the people to speak! Should we in the United States learn from China to limit the rights of the people to speak! Be as backward as China and destroy democracy!
Management always gets the benefits.
John Oliver would know a lot about meatpacking.
What's awful is this all started in 2018ish when Trump (unsurprisingly) cut federal standards and regulations for health, safety, hygienic workplace conditions, and more. He declawed unionization laws, and it wouldn't surprise me that these plant workers aren't union.
When is he gonna talk about Biden/Harris? Apparently there's literally nothing wrong with them? He's talked about Trump's bowel movements for the past 4 years. His lefty transparency is really astounding. Not surprised. Cuomo, Lemon, every single late night moron. 🤷🏿‍♂️
Ever read "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair? We're heading back to those days...
مين جي من داليا صبري 😂😂😂
Christian fundy slipping people bribes and acting horrendously, it is starting to sound way too familiar. Can't we just face it, christianity is at best away for people to "seem" nice and at worst an excuse to be nasty.
La muerte, es uno de los eventos más grandes que jamás tendrá lugar en tu vida.  Afrontamos la muerte todos los días, consciente o inconscientemente de ella; la muerte acecha en cada rincón de nuestra vida. Como un león esperando atrapar a su presa, la muerte nos llega a todos en muchas formas y formas; aparentemente no hay nadie que pueda escapar de las fauces de la muerte.  ¿Pero sabías que hay una razón por la que morimos? La idea de la muerte con la que está familiarizado es solo la punta del iceberg. Mira, morimos porque hemos pecado contra Dios. La muerte según la Biblia es paga "porque la paga del pecado es muerte" (Romanos 6:23).Debido a que el hombre pecó contra Dios, vivimos en un mundo caído, antes era perfecto, pero ahora está en ruinas. Ahora que el pecado existe, Dios viene a juzgar al mundo con justicia. Está establecido que un hombre muera una vez y después de este juicio "(Hebreos 9:27). El estándar por el que te juzgará son los 10 mandamientos, la ley moral de Dios.  Él es tan serio acerca del pecado que le dio a cualquiera que pecara la sentencia de muerte, la Biblia dice que te la has ganado pecando contra Dios y cada vez que pecas, acumula su ira. "El alma que pecare, esa morirá". (Ezequiel 18: 4) El castigo son los fuegos eternos del Infierno "Donde habrá llanto y crujir de dientes" (Mateo 13:42)  Tendrás que enfrentarte a Dios el Día del Juicio.  ¿Irás al cielo o al infierno?  Aquí hay una prueba rápida:  1-No tendrás otros dioses delante de mí. 2-No harás ídolos. 3-No tomarás el nombre del Señor tu Dios en vano, porque el Señor no dará por inocente al que tome su nombre en vano. 4-Recuerda el día de reposo. 5-Honra a tu padre y a tu madre. 6-No matarás. 7-No cometerás adulterio. 8-No robarás. 9-No mentirás. 10-No codiciarás.  ¿Alguna vez has dicho una mentira? robado algo? usó el nombre de Dios en vano? ¿Alguna vez has mirado a alguien con lujuria? Él ve la lujuria como adulterio, “Cualquiera que mira a una mujer con codicia, ya adulteró con ella en su corazón” (Mateo 5:28). ¿Alguna vez has odiado a alguien? él ve el odio como un asesinato, "Cualquiera que odie a otro hermano o hermana es un homicida" (1 Juan 3:15)  Santiago 2:10 dice, "la persona que guarda todas las leyes excepto una es tan culpable como una persona que ha quebrantado todas las leyes de Dios".  No confíe en su propia bondad o buenas obras para salvarlo. Eso es como sobornar a Dios para que te deje entrar al cielo; Ni una iglesia, pastor, sacerdote o religión alguna. Ninguno de nosotros es bueno en absoluto, incluso los asesinos, violadores, incluso Hilter se llamarán buenos y tratarán de justificarse por sus buenas obras. Pero la biblia dice:  • "Pero todos somos como cosa inmunda, y todas nuestras justicias son como trapos de inmundicia; nos marchitamos como una hoja, y nuestras iniquidades, como el viento nos llevaron". (Isaías 64: 6)  La definición de Dios del bien es moralmente excelente y, por lo tanto, exige perfecciones absolutas. Nadie puede igualar sus estándares. Por eso Jesús dijo: • "Nadie es bueno sino solo Dios". (Lucas 18:19)  Si ha hecho alguna de esas cosas, Dios lo ve como culpable de quebrantar su ley y la Biblia advierte que los culpables terminarán en el infierno. ¿Serás culpable el día del juicio final?  "Porque la paga del pecado es muerte, pero la dádiva de Dios es vida eterna en Cristo Jesús Señor nuestro". (Romanos 6:23)  Dios envió a su Hijo a sufrir y morir en la cruz. Jesús tomó el castigo sobre sí mismo y derrotó a la muerte en la cruz; no por tu Bien sino porque Dios es rico en misericordia.  "Porque tanto amó Dios al mundo que dio a su Hijo unigénito, el que en él cree no se pierda, sino que tenga vida eterna". (Juan 3:16)  Jesús resucitó de entre los muertos y venció a la muerte. Arrepiéntete (vuélvete del pecado) hoy y confía en Jesús y Dios te concederá vida eterna; también nacerás de nuevo.  Él te dará un corazón nuevo que desea la justicia, lo que es justo y un corazón que amará a Dios.  por eso Jesús dijo: "De cierto, de cierto os digo, que el que no nazca de nuevo, no puede ver el reino de Dios". (Juan 3: 3)  Luego, lea la Biblia y obedezca lo que lee.  ☆ ¿Cuándo vas a estar bien con Dios?  "Hoy, si escuchan su voz, no endurezcan su corazón como lo hicieron en la rebelión" (Hebreos 3:15) "Ahora es el tiempo aceptable, he aquí ahora el día de salvación". (2 Corintios 6: 2)  • "Tampoco hay salvación en ningún otro, porque no hay otro nombre bajo el cielo dado a los hombres en el que podamos ser salvos". (Hechos 4:12)  Es tu elección. Los dejo con esto: "¿De qué le aprovechará al hombre si gana el mundo entero y pierde su alma?" (Marcos 8:36).  Si te estás tomando esto en serio, ¿te gustaría una oración? Esta oración no es garantía de que serás salvo, eso es entre tú y Dios. Sin embargo, me gustaría que este fuera un buen comienzo para su viaje.  "Padre, te agradezco por el corazón abierto de esta persona y le pido que se arrepienta y confíe solo en Jesucristo. También te pido que guíes sus pasos en su camino para que pasen de la muerte a la vida. En el nombre de Jesús Amén.

Death, it's one of the biggest events that will ever take place in your life. We face death everyday, conscious or unconsciously of it; death lurks around every corner of our life. Like a lion waiting to catch its prey, death comes for us all in many shapes and form; seemingly there is no one who can escape from the jaws of death. But did you know there is a reason why we die? The idea of death you're familiar with is only the tip of the iceberg. See we die because we've sinned against God. Death according to the bible is wages " for the wages of sin is death " (Romans 6:23). Because man sinned against God, we live in a fallen world, it was once perfect, but now in ruins. Now that sin exists, God is coming to judge the world In righteousness. "It's appointed a man once to die and after this judgement" (Hebrews 9:27) The standard he'll judge you by is the 10 commandments, God's moral law. He's so serious about sin that he gave anyone who sins the death sentence, the bible says you've earned it through sinning against God and God pays you in death. each time you sin you build up his wrath. “The soul who sins shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) The punishment is the eternal fires of Hell " Where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew 13:42) You will have to face God on Judgement Day.  Will you go to Heaven or Hell? Here’s a quick test:  1.You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?)  2.You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made a god in your mind that you're more comfortable with, a god to suit yourself?)  3.You shall not take God's name in vain. (Have you ever used God's holy Name as a cuss word?)  4.Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.  5.Honor your father and mother.  6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder, 1 John 3:15).  7. You shall not commit adultery. ("Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart" Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage).  8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant).  9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions).  10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealously desired what belongs to others?)  James 2:10 says, “the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God’s laws.”   The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts.  If you have done any of those things, God sees you as guilty of breaking His law and the Bible warns that the guilty will end up in Hell. Will YOU be guilty on Judgement Day?   "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)  God sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross. Jesus took the punishment upon Himself and defeated death on the cross; not because your Good but because God is rich in mercy.  “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)  Jesus rose from the dead and defeated death. Repent (turn from sin) today and trust in Jesus and God will grant you everlasting life.  Then, Read the Bible and obey what you read.  Pray something like this:  "Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). This day I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is 'The way, the truth, and the life.'" Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."  When you find time please read this, it's Christian principles for growth:   https://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/
Stop playing with us John and cover what happened the last 3 months in politics 😤😤😤
how many human deaths does it take to make a wiener? Tyson knows.
The low penalty for a dangerous hazard is misleading. The penalty structure is progressive. Many things can be a life threatening danger but simple oversight. So they make it where one penalty isn’t going to close a business, but repeat penalties get very bad. A simple guard on a belt can not be deemed sufficient, and that be life threatening. Everything else is spot on though
Crazy how a non-news show is more informed about these issues than most news shows and even more than the public.
He should do a whole section on the fieldale in Gainesville Georgia I worked there for 3 days and I talked with people who had being there for 8 years and was scared to ask for a raise cuz she thought she would get fired. Like she never got at raise in 8 years. They should not have to ask for it they should be give the rare each year.
"a blank, $10000 check"... then it isn't blank...
So that’s why meat prices skyrocketed in 2020
"We're a food company, but we're a family" Anybody who has ever worked retail/ fast-food knows how much bullshit that statement is... just means your employer is going to overstep and ask too much of you.
this was a terrible story. but thank you John. now i kind of want to know who won the pool.
By my dictionary...family means : the workers or slaves of a house.  i really hate most of you. A LOT.
Wow what a shit report. I usually love Oliver but the amount of disinformation is despicable
Hats off, great insights. What a nightmare viewed from Belgium. USA is the n1 meat consumers. What a shame.
I will wager that whoever bets on the percent of employees that get Covid is a Republican....an evangelical Republican
Ah yes, a republishing of ‘The Jungle’ by Upton Sinclair
If businessmen are not held accountable for their devaluing of human rights, this will continue. And by accountable, I don't mean a fine that amounts to the pocket change of rich men. I mean actual jail time, and if the company in question is a large one, have it broken up into smaller companies, much like a monopoly should be.
Are the people working in corporate all blond?
When the employer is empowered by Law to be more than your Paycheck giver, but now can dictate your health life and other issues in your private life, that is like owning the Worker for real. Very dystopian Reality
LastWeek watchers here is something just for you.  If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, hated, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.  God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16    God is warning the world.  End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, satan is ruling with his plagues, violence, idol worship, scoffers, and government control... The earth is experiencing birth pains like never before, earthquakes, fires, floods. People now are lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, we see sexual immorality running rampant like adultery, fornication, homosexuality, sexual abuse rape... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in selfish child sacrifice (abortion), and religious persecution against Christians only (they will hate you because of me, Jesus (Matthew 10:22).  The world leaders are prepping for a,"One-World order," a "Great Reset," (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative, eternity in darkness, suffering in a lake of fire)  Soon the believers in Christ/Christians will be taken up, away with God, the world will be in turmoil, then the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many with his worldwide lies... then the tribulation will start, you will be forced to worship the beast and take his number. Life on earth will be horrific.  Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, receive Jesus as your savior, believe God raised Jesus from the dead (Romans 10:9), and repent of your sins, you are now saved by grace! Ephesians 4:8-9(NOT BY WORKS)
I'm sure John Oliver knows plenty about packing meat🤣
Sounds like ever factory in America
"While a perverted Owl ... just watches" the title of John's Sex Tape.
My grandfather worked in a meat packing plant for 30 years as part of the maintenance crew. His stories are HORRIFIC. They wear those blue gloves so they can find finger bits when hands get caught in the machine. On top of needing doctors, everyone who works in these facilities needs therapy for all of the truly horrifying things they've seen.
Aye at least my boy took his gloves off 🤷🏾‍♂️
john olier trending
These are good paying jobs that help many rural communities. Bunch of whiny crybabies that all grew up on Mcdonalds. Dont like the job, quit. $15 an hour is better than selling drugs or welfare. Its a dirty job. Its regulated by imperfect people. Shit happens. The system works and our society is fed with good, quality food.
funnily enough, all of these plants are in Right To Work (for Less) states.
"Greater oversight? The free market will take care of it!"  - GOP mouthbreathers.
Can we take a second to acknowledge that this multi-award winning https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3530232/awards "comedy show" is a chronicle of how terrible we are as a human race. Specifically the cruel and barbaric manner in which people in power strip the humanity from those without. John Oliver, you the aftershow to a cock fight.
This is every warehouse job. Try looking into Amazon next.
False. Immersion blenders do not fit in any drawers ever.
Just wondering...why the fuck did 2.1k people not like this?!
We need another Upton Sinclair to write an updated version of “The Jungle”.
Astronaut 1: Wait, it's all a dystopia? Astronaut 2: Always has been.
Have we actually gone backward since Upton Sinclair's day?
I need one of those guinea pigs to defend my apartment.
We really need to stop this “pussy” culture.
"Robot f*ck a soup."
Aren't MOST ALL of these companies OWNED by CHINA ?? Or did Gates buy them?
Stop trying to cancel meat John Oliver!
Went vegetarian years ago haven’t regretted it for a single day
Someone really should write a best selling, revolutionary book about this. Oh, oh wait... Oliver missed a great opportunity to use "Welcome to the Jungle" in the background.
So let me get this straight: Back in the day, in the US; unpaid labor, who had no rights, were given the bare minimum shelter and food to get by; processed industrial crops in the south.  Today low-paid labor who have no tangible rights, making just enough to get by; processes industrial crops and meats.  I fail to see how we as a society moved forward. This just gives weight to Richard Wolff's book Sickness is the System IMHO.
You are such a hack. Not funny anymore. Go away
As someone completing my OSHA 10 hour certification this is depressing
This may not be why I stopped eating meat, but it's one of the reasons I will never go back to it.
How about they all quit lol
Novel idea: stop eating animals and their byproducts.
H5N8: "Sup"
Open your eyes, go vegan!
This was an excellent segment
When I was in middle school, I had to read Upton Sinclair's The Jungle.  Several of my classmates LITERALLY vomited reading that book.  We're 115 years past the publishing of that book, but we haven't had nearly enough progress in that time.
God bless all the workers in this industry 💗🙏. We need to do everything we can to prioritize their safety. Upton Sinclair would be absolutely appalled. So too would Uncle Sam (since he was a meat inspector).
The meatpacking industry is almost the Republican dream. There are still too many regulations left. Why is the government so anti-capitalist? Children need jobs too.
How they treat the animals is how they treat their human workers - as commodities. This is no failure on the system's part, it is working just as intended.
Used to drive by this dude's head every day
God damn. That is worse then I could have even imagined.
That pecking order joke at the start? I'm very dissapointed that the "predator that can eat you" wasn't Adam Driver. Break my ankles you buffalo, sit on my esophagus you absolute giant.
John Oliver is garage
This is terrible.
Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle" lives and thrives.
Every animal is being killed each second and every worker Hass to cut the bodies that remain from the chicken each second causing injuries in a warm Hot factory in which every body of chicken is produced to people in today’s Society who have all the food choices in the but we produce meat even though the conditions are horrible.
How are things going back to the way labour was treated in the 19th and early 20th century. If capitalist societies with no moral compass in treating workers keep doing this, a resurgence of communism or something like it is the logical response. Note, not socialist which I personally support, but raw communism! Shameful.
Typical basic corporation "law" : cheaper to pay the fines,then fixing a working environment. Disgusting.
But I thought this was America, where we have right’s. < whiney voice sarcasm >
That's the best chicken commercial I have ever seen.
5:59 -  Yes!  Our country.  That's also why you're FAT!
Meatpackers are critical assets to this country! Can we please treat them like the professionals they are and pay them.
vegan 2021
And unfortunately the US is not alone in this...
This is why I didn’t feel comfortable working at a company that had one of the big poultry companies as a client. It was way before COVID and I was on the project for less than a week, but it still felt terrible.
You know what, being a vegetarian doesn't sound bad at all right now
Was waiting for them to mention Sanderson Farms or Koch... both known for constantly being raided by ICE every time their workers try to unionize. 😒
It's not much different at Walmart or an autozone warehouse
Replace with automation. Unfortunately unions will fight companies who want more robotics ...
America is seriously a third world country with a gucci belt
I haul food for a living and I can tell you that these meat plants are a cluster fuck the moment you get on their property and Tyson is the worst out of all of them and JBS is a close second.
You know, for some reason when John Oliver talks about "Meat Packing", for some reason Tyson Foods and actually packaging meat for sale isn't what comes to mind. Is that weird?
I mean, when you gotta go....you gotta go
The moment my boss refers to me as family, I'm quitting.
why is john oliver were i go for credible unbiased news....
I'm packing a lot of meat too
vote with your fork, choose plant based meat products... (much cleaner and workers are treated better). By buying meat products we support human and animal cruelty and it is horrific on both counts.
6:00, not your country...? The 1st thing I was thinking about was: "Wow, the U.S. again..." And the 2nd thought was my most common and most frequent  one: "The U.S. suck...again..." Every day I'm thinking about how terrible it is to live in the United States! Even though I grew up with western movies and other impressions  causing a deep yearning and desire to visit several places in "the New World" I'll probably waive it after getting all the other impressions which American seem to perceive as "NORMAL" like... racist cops killing citizens who see skin "colour" (for Europeans, it's odd to use that term as human property), QAnon believers,  grownup people who are totally into guns,  the general wide-spread low IQ and education level, politicians who are such stupid liars that I couldn't even pretend to believe in them, and all the horrible stuff about American society the Trump presidency had disclosed and many other things. The 70 million morons who had voted for another 4 year-long Trumpian shit-shot were the last nail to that coffin which I've buried all my desire and plans to see America. Maybe Canada or Mexico...
https://youtu.be/i-JAfDa-3wU
Okay i'm here before watching. Can anyone who watched this let me know if it will ruin meat for me? Preciate it!
Welcome to USA 🇺🇸
Ugly greed  unleashed and normalized by the logic of Raw capitalism in the World of Desperation for the majority.... and that on Repeat with no Time or Break  for serious Moral and Ethics Debates on how the medieval like politcs of Economy  affects Human and other Life on our Earth.. Scary future, when you think about it
Its sickening how we eat each other
Democratize the workplace!
John it never ceases to amaze me how  corporate greed causes people to be dehumanized. All for another buck...
Went fully plant-based 7 months ago. Logic outweighed my love of meat. Healthier, stronger, and saving a ton of money. This industry won’t get another penny from me.
Is it just me, or is this show overdue for stylistic evolution? The general rhythm and comedic angle has become highly  predictable ... which is kind of the fundamental antithesis of comedy.
Family, you keep using that word. I don't think it means what you think it means.
Please could you also put up the segment about Texas? I think a lot of people who swallow the Fox News pill could stand to hear what's *really* responsible for the awful scenes over there.
THAT is why I refused to eat meat for almost 40 years. And I don't even live in the USA.
It’s why I work hard to Unionize workers and hunt/fish my meat.
I'm gonna use thst line: give a fraction of a fuck. 🤣 Genius.
" For this cause I was born, and for this cause I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.” John 18:37
How can 1800 people vote this video down? That's almost as disgusting as the treatment of the people who work in these plants.
Greatest country in the world
Upton Sinclair literally wrote a novel about the way meatpacking exploits immigrants and other exploited groups in Chicago in 1906. It's titled the fucking "The Jungle."
The tale of the Brazilian company that had to grow and reach the US for finally be held accountable by any type of media or law enforcement
As someone from Iowa...that opening statement is 100% true and it's beyond disgusting. 😡😡😡😡
If an old confederate  slave owner would awake from his grave, he would reget to have ever revolted, cause to exploit people of color   is easier now as it was back then.
OSHA sets the guidelines and these company follow them by the skin of their teeth.... You can blame the companies or you can ask osha to look into these things and make policy changes
Upton Sinclair is turning in his grave.
Glad to know that not much has changed for factory workers since Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle"... /s
There are so many lies in this it's insane!  If you believe this guy you are not doing your own research!
Nhhbbhhhbb
Now do you guys see why vegans are so "annoying" and persistent? From the top to the bottom animal agriculture is despicable.
And at the end of the day it’s all for not because every one of those people in those plants can be replaced by machines that can do what they do better than they’re doing it eliminating all of these problems. Then again the same can pretty much be said for any job in the labor force and if they were replaced by machines we could eliminate the monetary system and get rid of all those jobs too and make it so everyone can do whatever they want for free solving all of our problems. Oh wait I forgot we prefer fantasy land were anything anyone does matters and the people that are coming up with new ideas and actually making contributions to their society get buried my mistake
john will you please just pivot to asmr already. namaste
his videos always help me sleep.
We need our unions back.
This is just wrong and it makes me so SAD.....covid caused over half million lives in America....
I work at a meat packing facility. This work exploits their employees who are mostly refugees and immigrants that speak little to no English. The lines are be breakneck pace. 10 to 12 hours work days with most sundays too. If you don’t come you get points
2:20 Not Adam Driver? I'm disappointed
Do more on the literal genocide in China
John Oliver loves to use people’s sorrows and hardship so he can make his millions at their peril. He is one useless dumb fuq
Well family members as employees are usually paid a low wage, so he does not lie.
Si veremos la otra parte plis 😊😍😘
"Put a Box over the inspector's head"? During a fire inspection? Wouldn't the BOX CATCH FIRE? LOL COULD  TRIP & FALL or have poor ventilation during a fire breathing inside of a fkn box?. I smell a liability lawsuit and I'm not even observing the factory!.. Sounds more like a scene from a SAW movie or FEAR FACTOR.  1st employee "GET OUT" ALIVE WINS? What a shitty job! Ironically it means we've been EATING SHIT as a result of the shitty production process. In goes live stock...out comes some murdered shit they call meat! At that point...... It's demonic meat since they all died a horrible death in fear then ritualistically fed to the living. .. Okay... Did I go too far? Lol
This video is Number 3 in the Trends in Germany 🇩🇪.Why though?
Pieces like this get me beyond frustrated, but unless I have actionable steps for what to do, I’ll forget all about it in a few days.
Dare ya to look into amazon work environments... cmon dare ya
At least it isn't obsessively about Trump for a change.
Stop supporting corporations like this, people!! Options.  1. You could start buying from small local farms        ... but then if everyone does that you'll put a strain on those small farmers with such a high demand causing them to start using the same terrible practices as factory farms. 2. A better solution -  is drastically lower your meat consumption, purchased from local farms, and learn to cook   a. vegetarian or     b. (even better) vegan meals   every once in a while...  3. The BEST solution - GO VEGAN and dont support any kind of mistreatment to all species. :D  You put your money where your morals are!
me, who watches WZZM on a daily basis :I
When meat packers get hit hard ... something very wrong is going on!
I wonder what if we would eat less meat...
it amazes me that people get their "news" from people like this
I eat refreshed meat - not frozen. A quarter of a cattle is delivered to the butcher and they cut the parts.
John Oliver - more interested in fudge packing.
Brought to you by Upton Sinclair Jr.
John Oliver needs to play the next Batman.. because he IS fucking Batman. Or the closest we'll get to it.
Funny, but as I child, we had a guinea pig who went crazy.
0:18 Who came up with this idea. And who said that this will sell.
um, your solutions are weak, John... we need to stop eating meat so these plants aren't required. They are inherently violent and unsanitary places. What did we expect? That slaughter would come out happy rainbows for ANYONE involved???
put a box on her head.  I literally can't even. I had to to pause and walk away. What the actual fuck?
Tyson is just another language for Amazon
Worst part is..this is how every industry operates now. From retail, logistics and any form of manufacturing company. Companies have spent all their for us on squeezing the most work out of the human body to gain the greatest profit.
This is sadly nothing new, Uptown Sinclair's "The Jungle" covered this way back in the early 1900s.
Upton Sinclair watching this like, "what did i fucking tell you guys"
I was chowing down on my McDonald’s Quarter pounder Deluxe, and suddenly felt simultaneously nauseous and guilty.  Damn you John Oliver, you ruined my dinner.
Looks like some meat eaters got offended and voted you down. Thank you for shining a light on this torture
I think we have a lot to learn when we can blame Tyson and don't see how we are complicit. For example American Meat consumption per person has gone up multiple times since the 1970s. Has our biology somehow magically changed since the 1970s so that we need to eat more meat?  No but our disease rates have but that's another story for another day. Long as we eat meat like it's an infinite growth Market we are as responsible as Tyson 4 the inhumanity to all life. My family we raised beef and chicken and pork and even we didn't eat meat everyday. I also participated in Slaughter but we were many times cleaner than what you'll find in those plants today. One of the reasons that I'm eating vegan it's because I don't want to be even remotely apart of something that inhumane. I'm not against eating meat I am against though having the wool pulled over my eyes and being told this is a great price. It is a great price I don't want to pay or participate in paying. I support  Small farmers raising meat locally and am part owner in a store that sells pork, poultry and beef raised in the community but I will not eat any meat myself until no people are dying left and right or crippled or orphaned from an inhumane corporate industry.
Workers have to learn the meaning and power of a Wildcat Strike. Grab them straight by the balls.
Imagine how dangerous these working conditions are for the animals...   Spoiler Alert 🚨   None of them make it out alive.
Like everything else buy local and responsible sourced.
13:46 "Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino" What monster decided to list them as that!?
"Home of the Brave", what a wonderful 1st world country, a beacon of light for us all.
America is overrated,  not surprised
Delighted to be vegan, especially now.
just started learning about this in the beginning of the year-this was super interesting! thanks for covering it
Just like Fredo is Michael's family
modern slav. you want to eat (cheap) meat everyday 3 times a day? you get THIS! :( OSHA needs to up their game? with what money? xD who gives them the money to operate? and who tells them to give what amount to which organization? ;) they are only there for show, nothing more ^^
Lots of reasons why I (and you should too) buy meat from locally owned butcher shops. Your local butcher can tell you exactly where that meat came from, usually within 100 miles of your town, you’re supporting your local economy ie the butcher and the farmers/ranchers, the meat and veggies don’t really cost much more than buying from Walmart or a chain grocer and taste much better.
and this my friends, is the reason why I'm a dirty commie
This is why I'm vegetarian
Every time you say "look, clearly x is terrible" it takes me out of the video
Most people in Weld County/Greeley still think Covid-19 is a hoax.  The Health Department and County Commissioners refuse to implement or enforce safety guidelines.
We should hire butchers to do this. Way better than factory shit.
X
Another great reason to be vegetarian.
Covid nineteen is a murdering Nazis lie and I did not vote for Donald Trump
When you're a corporation, calling labor workers at your factories, family, is an insult. Send your own children and family to work the floor and we'll see if you still call them family.
New drinking game: take a drink every time John Oliver says something about animal sex or beastiality.
If only there were true comedians
To paraphrase something famous someone said, he does get the chicken to the grocery store on time
Abolish ICE and put its funding towards OSHA!
I notice that it is getting harder and harder for John to even FIND problems to talk about for which bringing back the guillotine should not be a HUGE part of the solution.
🌱
BRAVO!!👏👏👏 I have been transitioning to a plant based diet lately due to the horrors of the industry, this just gives me more motivation to stick with it, thank you John Oliver!
Ugh, I'm OSHA certified and we were told what to expect: the organization is terribly understaffed and maybe 0.5% of companies are inspected each year.
Type "meatpacking" into Pornhub you get a very different video
At this point, it feels like the only way to make these companies change is to drag their ceos and shareholders out of their offices and mansions and make them work in their own factories for a few years.  Only way they would start to feel anything about the “minority’s and whitetrash” who are practically treated as slaves in their companies.  Anyone agree?
cant wait until Oliver fucks up an the zombie PC mob comes for him
Damn John, now you know whats  going to happen because of this? Nothing.
Who even eats their stuff? It looks so gross
Thank you for writing this fustercluck of a piece. This was an incredible experience to witness.  John Oliver 2024 with running mate  Cody Johnson (from Some More News).  Live. Love. Be. Believe.
if my family treated me like that, i’d disown them.
The awful conditions animals endure in factory farms is talked about a lot? Uhhhhh not enough apparently since it’s still happening. 😥
Capitalism at its best
American is a third world country.                                     1. Healthcare is broken.                                              2. People can’t survive with minimum wage.          3. Police is killing citizens.                                    4. Covid run wild                                                          5. Both parties are one party and bought by billionaire and millionaire
so if he left the "void" at the end of last season, and then blew it up cuz it was 2020, where is he now? void 2 electric boogaloo?
Too late stage capitalism
Oh look, reason #1782 why you don't pay enough for the food you eat
Am I the only person who got uncomfortable when he said 'namaste' in a British accent?
Chobani Yogurt is real family company.  The owner gave shares of the  company to the workers .
Thank you john oliver  Work at sugerdale foods which distrubutes jbs and tysons meats and yes this this happens and it makes no sense but your sortof right on how to fix  Trust me these places r a burning tire fire about to destroy itself
I appreciate how accurate the auto-generated captions are, but hey, Last Week Tonight? You can afford to be professionally captioned.
yet another reason to be Vegan. If you are still eating meat, you are part of the problem
Slavery in this country never went away. Just took another form.
My guy took no sick days in his 30 year career and died and his company gave no shits. Proof that you are disposable to these people. Take your sick and vacation days.
As a former meatpacker in texas I just want to say that it gets worse, most of the workers where I worked were all temps, witch means they don't qualify for the little workers comp there is
Dont eat it.....Ever
There are so much more interesting and important stuff going on in the world, but John Oliver, tells us about the worst jobs in the US
I've recently had the good fortune, after 3+ years of unemployment, to land a job with a company which has a great workng culture. One of those rare situations where we, collectively, get an awfull lot of stuff done, without actually feeling we're particularly exerting ourselves.  My other work experience makes me realise this is an exceptional situation and, in most companies, people are being worked harder. However, no worker here would agree to the conditions exposed in this piece. Don't tell me these people don't have a trade union fighting their corner.
Gosh, this makes me happy I raise my own beef, pork, and chicken.
Always wash over your chicken with water before cooking it.   Something had to die for me to eat,  plant or animal. Let's move forward on that.  Reform takes an act of Congress.
To the one person reading this: you’re a legend and adorable, stay safe
The dipsh*t anchor saying "that is disgusting" like an oblivious Karen when that worker was for sure pressured not to leave the processing line for fear of losing their job, which they are paid far less than her entitled ass.
That's Dame Judi Dench to you my good man. #PutSomRespectOnThatName
So Basically the problems are small government and rampant capitalism  Nothing new under the sun
Wow... Almost as bad as here in germany
Working conditions at the Kraft turkey processing facility in Newberry, South Carolina are disgusting. Working there will change your eating habits, as well as shake up your social etiquette.
that is a hilarious commercial
If you eat meat, you are part of the problem. The only reason these workers suffer is because of the demand for their product. Expanding OSHA and putting into place better safety measures seem important, but they are a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. It's like trying to solve prostitution by telling girls not to be prostitutes, instead of examining why the demand for prostitution exists in the first place. I'm not saying that everyone needs to be vegan RIGHT NOW, but even cutting down on your individual intake by one day or one meal a week makes a huge difference, especially if everyone starts to do it.
Nobody ever tell me organic is overrated...sorry I rather pay more and eat less instead of supporting those companies. Ew...I feel bad for the workers.
UPS is no different.
We have too many reasons to go vegan
If you've read "The Jungle", you don't need to watch this.  Not much has changed.
I personally know people that work in the chicken industry and it's a lot worse than what the video shows. They tell poop flies in their face, chickens scratch them and causes infections. I know a guy that uses a metal glove so when he hangs the chicken on the hook his nuckles don't hit thr hook. I look at his hands they're literally buffed up and purple. He tells me they're been like that for years now. You have to hook 80 chickens a min, that's less than a sec per chicken like wow. Supervisor literally stands next to you with a stopwatch to pressure you to perform
Wow! I’m speechless.
...so Upton Sinclairs' "The Jungle", but also "the rich stay rich"?
And yet, everyone reading this and commenting still eats the meat produced by these companies!
Question from someone that isn't from the USA and keeps getting amazed wot the things happening there: any reason why these workers aren't unionized?
It's simple:  go vegan.
1:10 thought Adam driver would be next
When slavery is your foundational corporation you will see replication pervade the nation.  Ironically the white population gets a lot of slavery sludge on them, quite a bit but look over there (you're white)!
What’s this fuckery w/ Jim Perdue and that dumb ass commercial! Who the hell would see that and then say “ Man! I can’t wait for a quick meal” 🙄
Watching how horrific & inhamane meat factory conditions are while proceeding to eat Tyson's honey battered chicken tenders. 😱  It's the only non-disgusting Tyson product I'll actually eat so thank you to the workers who wore diapers & broke their necks for me to have these nuggets, but for real I thought being overworked 70+ hours a week at a pharmaceutical distribution factory with no off days for multiple months on end was barbaric & inhumane but I'll never take it for granted again because meat packing workers really do have it the worst, at least where I work we're never denied bathroom breaks & can go as we please as long as we need just as long as your numbers meet the monthly quota but we also had clean conditions aside from dust it's just that the endless work hours are impossible.
The US is effectively one big everlasting Stanford Prison Experiment
What are rules? In the face of corruption, rules are meaningless! In the face of collapsing systems, collapsing laws, collapsing rules! They don't follow the rules, why do we follow the rules?
Vegans: we're not surprised mothafuckas!
Go #vegan
It’s easy to get mad about this stuff but in the end people just don’t want to or can’t afford to pay more for food so if we want it to remain this cheap they have to find was save money and generally the easiest way to do that is with human pain and suffering.
capitalism lowkey bad
@13:20. Finally  John. Your good old british irony  has returned. We really  miised it ...
I want the link for that commercial
Great report. But please, asian AMERICAN in 2021
So why is our government letting more people into the U.Swho will need shelter food and jobs when we already have homelessness poverty and people living in these conditions.People come here to escape being treated this way.Yet we can't even take care of the people already here.We can't even fix things like this in.America.Yet our politicians talk like they want to be saviors of the world.The fact is they don't care.They are rich and live in.fancy houses and could not care less.They just want people to believe they are moral.They are whats.called communal narsisist.We really need to fix problems in our own back yard before we fix entire world.
Sooo happy you're back making videos
Not gonna lie, there's a lot of this story to find grotesque. This is by no means the most important thing to take away from this video, but its the thing I think most likely to receive some form of response or notice. So, I'm just gonna say it: Oliver saying "homeless who sleep on the street" is super dehumanizing and kind of fucked; they're people. Calling any people a noun like "homeless" just completely removes the humanity. They're people forced to sleep on the street. Hard to take him serious on his awful working conditions are in these plants when he clearly sees homeless people as unworthy of being recognized as people.  People are people, respect em.
Tyson corporate employees are complicit if they’re not actively trying to help line workers.
This is why you have to regulate corporations. As soon as you give them a small pass, they will throw you aside and abuse everything and everyone. REGULATE THEM!
Ain't tyson the same company that had workers wearing diapers at one point because they threatened to cut bathroom breaks from paychecks?
American capitalism at work .
john oliver is really lucky cause hasan show was way better. Now he'll probably keep his award domination.  Patriot act will always be better then last week.
...time to be a vegan
I'd bet the managers were using gsllows humor because the CEO ordered them to re-open (or keep open) the factory.  Remember, they'd be included in the infected total.
Thank you John Oliver, who would have thought you would be the voice of reason in USA when you were just an an ackward geek in the UK
If you hate this country so much why don’t you beat a hasty exit ...there are ways  of spotting problems without spouting your hatred for the U S A
Saying your employees are family is toxic employment. It's a way to convince you to do things that you wouldn't normally do. If they say that, run. They will abuse the shit out of you. Employment is a contractual agreement. Nothing more, nothing less.
Tyson is the kind of family where they love one kid while the other gets locked inside a narrow locker, standing up and wrapped in wire mesh.
Demonic guiena pig... used as a selling point for Purdue entrees...  What even...
* God's grace *  Did you know that God loves you so much that he sent Jesus to save us? Jesus is the son of God! And he loves you very much!

I find that my desire to stay informed is conflicting heavily with my desire to stay sane.
oh boy seems we all forgot to read The Jungle
You can drastically improve workers lives, animal lives, and the planet by not supporting the animal industries. Noone should spend their day dismembering corpses. These workers have some of the highest suicide rights of any profession. Go vegan y'all.
Officially doomerpilled
I thought that commercial was kind of funny.... but......
I'ma like the opener when I watch TV commercials..."try to guess what they are selling". And I'm always always wrong.
A little disappointed JO didn't encourage viewers to reduce/eliminate their meat consumption.
Yeah, this country is most definitely not great.  And thanks to trump, it's even less great.
The free market in action lol
Gonna buy more $TSN stock now 🤑
they need to unionize! fight for workers rights. I'm a proud union carpenter and I wouldn't work any other way
Here in Peru, we'd eat that fucking guinea pig.
Please, America, tell us again how healthcare for all is a really dangerous, "communist" concept that threatens the American people while having the market regulate itself is so much better.
2.1 thousand people are completely soulless
hundreds of millions of innocent aminals are being slaughtered, but oh no! 8 workers passed away from covid.
That themesong is like therapy for my ears
lmao is this year actually 1921?
This is horrifyingly bad
What John didn't mention is that they just didn't hire immigrants, they hired immigrants in exchange for green cards. It is literally called a chicken factory green card. So it puts them in a more vulnerable position because they will lose their green card if they get fired or quit
Oh how I’ve missed you a John! 😀 You’re an absolute pleasure
Any company who calls themselves a "family" will 100% try to extort you for free labor. Its a fact.
There and Amazon and pretty well anywhere else (you could make the same show every week for a year with different companies), but you still scream "Communism" as soon as we start discussing worker's rights, so stop the hypocrisy.
Thanks for exposing this.
soooo......... cancel meat?
Meanwhile, the execs make hundreds of thousands and millions.  Been there, done that.
The Department Veterans Affairs Death Care System needs to be replaced as well!
Just patiently waiting for John Oliver Guided Meditations now...
Oliver and 99% of this story is total BS. I worked in the nations largest beef processing plant for 15 years. Iowa Beef Processors (IBP) and then Tyson when the bought IBP. The plant I worked in employed over 2,000 employees. Processed over 5,000 head of cattle per day. This crap does not happen. The guy pissing on the production line is 100% to blame. Never in 15 years was anyone denied breaks when they needed them. NEVER.  Oliver and this story is full of sh!t, literally.
Everyday I am reminded that America is ghetto
ok, but by their response... JBS looks to give 0 F#cks to their workers... which is equal to no F#cks!!!
So liberal propaganda media nut head. Stop complaining and open your own chicken manufacturing plant and let see how you treat your employees. All the people working at those companies have the right to leave anytime they want. I use to work at Washington Beef. I decided to quit and open my own business. So stop complaining and open your own business. However, I don't think you have the skills or the ability to create your own business. Typical liberal complainer
Why the hell do we call ourselves the civilized world ? We are such a self deluding disgusting arrogant species aren't we ? But hey..we put a shiny thingy in a totally dead red desolated world....applause everyone !! By the rate we have taking things in our hands we will be the next red planet SOON !
13:14 John🤣🤣
While I agree with everything JO have said about this, i also think that all of those workers still wants to work there. It's the best offer they have.
Eating a veggie dog while watching this wasn't about feeling superior, but it wasn't not about feeling superior.
hey i've read this one
That guy is looking old AF!!
Human Being's are stupid!
Its sad that in acountry with the 2nd ammendment these ppl can just do this and we let them...
Wait...... George f head DID WHAT!!!!!!!! 😞😞😞
Recklessly Endangerment of Workers, should be fined with atleast 30% of the Companys Profit!
I kept reading metapacking, didn't expect anything about meat.
What a f***ing horrible commercial.
Day after day I realise more that Universal Basic Income can help so much with work place issues. It's been always about who have the laverage not who is on the right side.
End capitalism today.
Not taking anything away from what Oliver is saying, he is 100% factual... but if the video clips are current and from Tyson, then why are the staff not wearing masks. Starting at 3:57 half the people have no mask on, wearing it at their chin. They have to take some of the responsibility of getting affected. Then management needs to take responsibility for their lack of action  by not checking the low paid workers to ensure they are wearing their masks.
George Zimmerman sold that gun for $250,000 in case anybody else didn’t know
Thank you for not making episodes about trump and moving on
Capitalism will ultimately fail
I also have been treated like a human machine by 2 very big companies (my official employer and my "unofficial" employer), but at least it was "just" my brain and hands that were abused, I didn't risk losing limbs or had to pee in my chair…
Who won the betting pool?
I would just like to know how many people are working on the Last Week Tonight team. We know it's not just John Oliver (no disrespect and of course hats off to you sir) but Jesus they can dig up the dirt like nobodies business. Can you imagine if the team that works on the Last Week Tonight show was an actual governmental regulatory agency? LULZ They'd be shutting shit TF down and breaking banks.. They'd probably all have "unfortunate accidents & suicides" O_O Mad props on the info gathering and much respect to John Oliver.
Meat industry in Germany is not the best place to work in (I was told). But seeing this video makes the German meat processing plants like heaven.
Crazy how this is a little over a century after Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle and the meatpacking industry is still on their bullshit
FINALLY SOMETHING THAT ISN'T political
This is what "Make America great again" means. Corporation getting away with murder.
Go read The Jungle by Upton Sinclair - nothing has changed in more than 100 years. There is also a great book called The Chain by Ted Genoways that discusses these issues in detail.
I love how poloticians are all like, "we're gonna creat thousands of factory jobs!", to which no one responded, "Great! I can't wait to do this bullshit!".
meat is terrible for the employees, our health, the environment, and the animals. there is no good reason to eat it
Does any one know of any branded meats that don’t treat people like shit ? Thanks , it’s just so hard to consume ethically , or atleast try to.
This is one of those situations where I seriously consider arson. Its gonna cost more than those fines to rebuild a building.
And: Nothing will change...
Pissing on the floor isn't that bad - do you know what those floors must be like with all the detritus that falls during the job

Man I’ve been eating vegetarian for a while and now I’m really disgusted by the meat packing industry. As someone who thought I’d never be vegetarian, it’s really not that bad. There’s so many good alternatives and it’s better for your health. ✌🏻 but do what you guys want no judgment
Buy your meat from a local trusted butcher
This is why trump was reversed by his buddies when he tried to nix the foriegn workers in America so that Americans could come in and do those jobs during the pandemic...
Tyson runs my town lmao
Now you also know why those evil Companies start to move out to Texas. NA is at this point a third world country shithole.
so this is an old new upload or recorded way before January you would think the opening season show would be all about January
Look, one of your solutions should really have been to reduce meat consumption. Yes, OSHA needs reform and workplace standards need to be improved. But you cannot ignore supply and demand. People want a lot of cheap meat, you get a lot of shady business practices. That can only change of the demand changes.
TRUMP ALSO REMOVED THE RESTRICTIONS ON SAFTY STANDARDS THAT THEIR WORKERS USE TO HAVE...              HE ALSO REMOVED MOST OF THEIR LEGAL OPTIONS THEY HAD TO WORKING IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT COULD GET THEM SICK...
You should do the factory workers in China one next.
Bets on how many workers get sick? That’s cold.
i tried tyson's frozen chicken nuggets once. they are disgusting. its a no for me dawg.
No doubt, the US are still are slave holder society.
Well then, we'd better start pressuring the current administration to massively increase funding for OSHA.
Veterans and workers are treated like trash in this country
wow super fucked up why do workers keep getting fucked in the US?!?!??!?
You FCKING HERO, mean that and sending so much love your way (The team too )... Also I had to cuss.. No disrespect
LMFAO!!!!!
"I fucking warned you dude. I told you, bro"  - Upton Sinclair
Key takeaway fro, this segment: John should start publishing meditation audio.  Seriously though, these practices are disgusting!
Wasn't a law passed in late 2020 that stated the needed to increase the chicken production I believe -45 signed that
90% of the people in this clip are highly overweight 🤨
Did Lincoln really end slavery back then?
The whole country has become a joke. Pathetic.
Perdue probably got OxyContin in their food
Love that he's more directly addressing the failure that is capitalism
So if the government doesn't care about this issue, and the people don't have the power to decide such issue, who will make any changes? Who cares to make any changes?  In the end the corporations will pitch the ordinary people to fight against each other so they can sit back and count that fat bonus they received for running the company (government) so well
The solution to this AND last week’s topic is don’t eat meat. Is not good for the environment, our health, and the animals.
Attacking the meat plants, count down to lawsuit. Ask Oprah for what not to do.
USA, greatest country in the wourld, for the 10%. How the rest is just taking it is a mystery to me.
Strange, i thought they already did this one a few years ago about chickens.... Just bring a problem to americans attention that usually will take care of it.
this is why we need a nationwide strike. when everyone realizes the severity that our fellow workers are in being abused like this, perhaps something will change, like eliminating factory farming....its not good for the planet or us. people all need to refuse to work in these places , humans are not machines, and shouldn't be so abused.
This is the problem with Capitalism. If we end up winning, those jobs will just go to the countries where treating workers like this is still legal.
Would love to see John take on the trash industry and how drivers are treated.
Oof the divorced parents one hit a little too close to home
11:22 John Oliver wishes he was that owl.
15,000$ for 6 lives. Meanwhile, small crime committed by a minority or poor person costs  20 years in jail.
America: where every single atrocity you can imagine exists.
Worker related injuries for the USA is already not looking great. But, knowing that companies even get around OSHA reports just makes everything so much worse...
Only half way through. Were the hell are your Unions?
More than a decade of being made fun of for not eating meat; the men who've walked away, the family arguements that still arise over mashed potatoes, the collegues who didn't invite me to lunch at the steakhouse or sushi bar...  I always knew it was the right thing in my heart and be it for the animals, for the workers, for the enviornment, against government subsidies or for our health-- there is truly no question in my mind that mass production of animals is WRONG.
Good to have you back John
Over capitalism will eventually kill america if measures are not put in place to stop the exploitation of poor by the few filthy rich.
Wow the people who run an industry of immense cruelty on an unimaginable scale, murdering billions of animals a year for profit doesn't treat their employees well. Who would have guessed. Choose compassion, stop supporting cruelty amd go vegan.
Purr unadulterated capitalism... and I bet the corporate welfare for these companies would make your head spin. Billions of your tax dollars going to these goons.
Betting on how many cases they'll get is probably the most "family" the supervisors treat the workers. I have some pretty dumb people in my family that I'd bet something like that (without money tho)
*american dream, leadies and gentlemen.*

if you’re looking to help this situation, going vegetarian or vegan is a great way to do so, but even just eating meat one less time every week or having a meatless day every week goes a long way too!
God dammit John...I love your show but holy shit some of these stories are so hopeless. I get it, we're fucked. I think we need some 20 minute deep dives about people/companies doing awesome progressive things for a few months because I literally can't stomach this shit anymore.
I worked at Indiana Packers (Pork processing plant)  in Delphi Indiana and I had covid-19, and they wouldn't let me leave or I would get fired, I left anyways and quit. Now I'm jobless.
Man, if only if only there was some way to avoid supporting these companies.... /sarcasm. Go vegan, y'all.
Everyday I find another reason to be glad I went vegetarian
i was a little disappointed you didn’t bring up the treatment of animals, but still, great job showing the huge price tag our “cheap” meat comes with in this country!
That commercial was hilarious, but I can't find it anywhere else to show people.
This is totally our country. We live in a capitalist death cult.
Shocked?  Welcome to late stage capitalism. The many slaving to enrich the few.   Give OSHA teeth! Minimum fine $20,000.
It feels like Upton Sinclair is rolling in his grave over how these workers are treated
How do you all feel about meatless meat?
Heh. The Jungle; Book two
The melodic bush additionally report because beard quickly milk until a harmonious venezuela. wooden, staking badger
Eating meat exploits humans, animals and causes pandemics GO VEGAN.
In general, large companies violating regulations and the law should be fined a hard standard % of their yearly income that will properly put a real dent in their profits. Otherwise they will never care
look up who owns Smithfield pork he left that out because he is a tool..this is just another part of the greendeal the govt is going to tell u what you can eat
How many of you also thought this video might be ass-ociated with something gay ?
Judy Dench IS a f**cking treasure
Please consider going vegan!  Maybe try for a week? Two weeks? See how it goes!
You can all thank "Regananomics" failed trickle-down economics (TDE) for where the US is today. The republican party put it into effect saying that the more money the wealthy have the more people they can hire and pay them all higher wages. Sounds good, right? However, they did it in arguably the greediest country in the world, where instead of following the unsaid rules of the plan they built golden umbrellas for themselves and the CEO's with shell corporations. This has lead to the Grand Canyon size gap between the wealthy and the poor forcing the "poor" to become a type of slave labor to the large corporations where not just one job will cover all their bills any longer due to the constant standard of living rises and no rise in minimum wages, again, something that (TDE) was supposed to cover with all the tax breaks for the wealthiest "People or now included 'Corporations'", because now the corporations are now declaring that "...they are people too." This sealed the deal on any real legal pursuant of the CEO's and board members making them "not responsible" for any losses the company may incur, say to a pandemic or a deep recession and also included the large corporations in on the huge tax breaks the Republicans were offering to the wealthy "people". This is also why they can/will always request bailouts during times like the aforementioned catastrophes rather than being responsible for their own companies financial safety net like you and I and small business owners have to build. Sorry for the length.
'dysfunctional' is too polite, try 'cruel and abusive'
The subsequent boundary demographically measure because page compatibly prepare vice a silent fruit. abusive, special path
imagine what good could happen if people just simply stopped treating innocent animals like commodities
Well well well...  Trump is out of office and John Oliver is reporting actual stories again.
A truly awful industry, morally bankrupt.
there is one more Idea John: End big agro subsidizing.  If our agricultural system was socially subsidized, than industrial agro production would cease to produce meat anywhere near current levels. less meat, higher prices, smaller consumption, sustainable economics, healthier populations, and smaller more safely run processing facilities.
Forgot to mention that they are paid next to nothing. From what I’ve seen 28k per year is on the HIGH end. This is industry is just purely criminal
Main stream media trying to take away your protien so u cant properly develop, eat more soy sheep.
So @johnoliver are you vegan? After everything you've seen and researched, why not? I'd like you to do a story on vegans.
Toxic waste in our rivers should be next they get fined a few hundred dollars for dumping ten of thousands of gallons of chemicals
It was about 100 years ago that the novel The Jungle came out exposing the horrible conditions in the meatpacking industry. Would another expose like that one reform the meat packing industry? Probably not.
Will the last person out of the US please remember to turn out the light.
cannibal joke pidgeon stuff
This guy is a racist. Wow.
“Looks like chicken breast” eh
Watching this show shows that America is a third world country, if you look at how they treat their people.
"All of this has to be done quickly" Narrator: but it won't
Wouldn't it be crazy if we all just boycotted slaughterhouses and meat packing factories!
Upton Sinclair is rolling is his grave right now
When you let a private business to regulate itself and the government turns a blind eye when laws are broken, it literally becomes the wild west and these businesses will do everything in their power to come out winning, even at the cost of a person's well being or life.
We need one exposing the apple industry in Washington state nobody has bothered to lift up the door mat over here
Happy I've been reducing my meat consumption over the years
I didn't think someone could look more like a Keebler Elf than Jeff Sessions, but Bo Pilgrim just said, "Hold my chicken."
This is why I prefer tofu over steak
i think i can see the reflection of the fires of hell in john's glasses in this episode, even though his background makes it seem like he's filming in heaven..anyone else?
John Oliver left a perfectly grand Armie Hammer "on the food chain" joke that he's kicking himself over...right now.
At least he took off his gloves
It’s like we shouldn’t eat meat or something...
We're all going to be eating impossible meat soon anyway...Its all part of the Great reset...just ask Judy Dench
Class action lawsuits these pos, unionize, and provide adequate funding for OSHA. Simply despicable
Sanderson farms
Packing your meat tonight with John Oliver 😂
10:54 🤔 Reading a Bible... to a _chicken._ 🤔
Animals are taking an L, humans who pack and eat the animals are taking L's, the environment is taking a fat L... All so people can have some nasty Tyson nuggets
Imagine giving a company your life for 30 fucking years, to be killed due to negligence and the company won't even give your widow the income they deserve.  Fuck corporations to hell...
john oliver effect do your thing
The biggest problem, is meat tastes so damn good. I am glad they are finally making plant based meat that is starting to taste as good as the real thing. Our evolution craves meat, because it was rare when we where hunter gathers. Now we have massed produced it we have abundance. I think the only solution we have forward is making plant based food taste more like the real thing.
Who else watching while eating juicy ass philly cheese steak?
i would rather sell crack then work in meat paking
$15,000!? Wow...
I would say that it's a good thing I'm vegan, but employees working in the produce industry get exploited and mistreated by their employers too.
And we SUBSIDIZE THIS  BULLSHIT!
Always an emotional rollercoaster :-/
heard the ".00003%" at the end and had the social network flashbacks. god i wish these asshole companies COULDN'T lawyer up because they deserve to be eaten.
modern slavery, US uomber one export good.
10:04 🤔 What would compel one to keep a photo of a chicken on the wall?
I'm sure this has nothing to do with Bill Gates proposing that only synthetic meat be eaten in rich countries.
Are people still Suffering in the hands of this devils
These kinds of shows are always bitter-sweet because it is fun to hear them roast hell out of these people. But sad when 6 month to a year later you find that jack has been done to fix the problem. I guess maybe sometimes they make inadequate improvements like maybe a nurse with some Advil.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOnrCrFH1tw
Why does this sound like walmart is the same way
Regulation causes labor costs to go up, which affects the owner's bottom line. Or, if you heard it on Fox: "Commie liberal regulations on the attack! When proud Americans - who provide jobs - are forced to cough up their own hard earned dollars for pointless red tape policies in their factories, you have to ask, why do elitist socialists hate successful businesses? I'm Chad McTuckerson. God bless your buckshot."
This is story sounds like whole bunch of bullshit to me, I think John Oliver thinks if you have a job you’ve been oppressed by rich people.
Is it weird that I’m just happy he can cover something other than Donald Trump?
I know you are busy Mr. President but you or someone on your staff should watch this
Another reason not to eat meat.
I hate when a worker complains about bad conditions and in return they get this response "At least you have a Job". If someone had a busted leg you wouldn't take away their crutches and be like "At least you have another leg".
it's not the tiny fines that make them not care for their workers, it's the fact that exploiting and killing individuals is the core of the industry. that it's normally individuals not born into the same genetics as them(aka non humans) doesn't protect those who are from getting treated similarly, especially when being of a lower, less protected class https://www.animallaw.info/article/link-cruelty-animals-and-violence-towards-people  don't forget about the psychological damage of slaughterhouse work itself as well, ptsd is extremely common there, which in turn increases crime such as rapes, domestic violence and murder as well https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1016401 https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2010/05/14/probing_the_link_between_slaughterhouses_and_violent_crime.html  besides risk of amputations there are also cancers from gut bacteria getting sprayed everywhere when getting disemboweled, and several others https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20541185/  anyway, this is just a fraction of the reasons to boycott animal agriculture altogether #govegan
Watching while eating sirloin steak
The sarcasm 😂 wow these corporations are over pathetic...
When I worked for Dispatch we literally locked OSHA out of  the building and by the time they made it past security, management would have already redistributed the people and sent the drunk morons to lunch. And yes drunk people driving forklifts happened daily and their jobs were protected by their union, a union that part time employees had to pay into but derived no benefit from. The company was sold so hopefully things have changed.
Ywn
Hey John Oliver....why dont you return to your country of origin....
If you eat meat, you support this! Time to go plant-based!
Fun actual story, that bribing poultry king, Bo Pilgrim? Dallas Baptist University named their chapel after him. Yayyyyy corruption in church.
My first formal job was on the maintenance crew for a poultry packing company. Pretty much the entire line was made up of Mexicans. I never saw anything overtly illegal but I only worked there for a few months.
Go vegan y'all.
Apparently 2k poultry executives watched this video based on the dislikes

1. No, we're not family. You are buying labor from me. We're in business.   2. "Surely this is not our country?"  Yes, when unions have been destroyed and pro-exploitation policies like, the orwellian named, "right to work" laws are implemented then this is the result.
The meat industry should immediately be halved. Theres no need for the amount of meat we eat or produce.
Go get 'em, John.  I quit buying chicken YEARS ago after seeing the inside of just one poultry production operation (Perdue).  Don't eat it at restaurants, don't buy it from grocery stores, if I'm buying chicken, it's sourced from a local butcher who sources from local free-range farms.  No, it's not cheap.  But it's not killing me, my family, or anyone in the production line between the chicken and me.
The new look with the blue is nice
Thank you, thank you, thank you ❤️
"But, I mean, _surely,_ this is _not_ in our _country."_ I mean... would you _prefer_ it be in some _other_ country?  Are people in _other_ countries less deserving of basic, human _dignity?_
I've been reviewing my US history and this reminds me of the early industrial revolution and the Carnegie plants. The social darwinism is alive and well in the 21rst Century
Nick Reding describes in his book Methland how jobs like these drove the demand for meth in communities that traditionally didn’t have a big drug problem. The only way many workers could keep up with the demands of these meatpacking jobs was by taking meth.
It's really important to not refer to homeless/houseless people as just "homeless." They're people. They aren't solely identified by their status.
Look, peoples lives are very important unless protecting them costs money. See also the expectation that schools start back up whether teachers are vaccinated or not.
I never thought Upton Sinclair's The Jungle would become relevant again.
16:03 reminds me of boxer the horse from animal farm
All good. Please take 10 min. and listen to Dr. Chuck Missler. . Science and Discovery. Created Evolution. The onus of mankind is to promulgate the axiom of the mean. Peace.
So capitalism... No good?
This is VITAL information and was so necessary to produce and release! Bravo John and production team 👏👏 Although I knew these horrific instances within the meat packing industry as I only eat seafood no poultry or red meats POLICIES MUST CHANGE by informing the public 1st and moving quickly!! I refuse to give my money thus empowering these awful companies. Sharing this video with those I know care to have wisdom.
The meat industry treats their employees like animals. Didn’t see that one coming.
Meat causes so many problems. Pandemics, climate change, heart disease, etc. please go plant based!!
You should change the show's name to "Just shithole country things ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
Capitalism at its finest.
the jungle 2
Hahahahaha. yeah... right. Worked at Tyson's poultry processing plant in my early 20's. They don't give a damn about their workers. All they care about is if you're coming to work or not & work faster. Only two 30 minute breaks and poverty wages.

Late capitalism is just fucking slavery 2.0. The richs doens't care about you, for them you are just numbers. Without regulations this is what will happen to all the poors.
It's stories like these that make me glad I stopped eating meat.
I don't believe in god, but I wish hell exists
I stopped eating anything but locally produced pork and chicken a couple of years ago. And it wasn’t because of morals, although it does feel a little better knowing the animal might have been treated humanely. I stopped buying mass produced meat because I felt ill every time I ate it.  I think it’s because of how the animals are treated AND how the meat it packed. The lack of regulations in this country regarding food, especially meat is truly gross.  I went to Japan a year ago, where most meat is sourced from local farms, and food is highly regulated. I never felt sick even one time after eating there, even beef which I can’t even think about eating here in America.  And it’s not just meat. I basically have to eat whole foods here. Nothing packaged, nothing processed. Even fucking oats make me feel gross if I buy well known brands like Quaker.  I was only visiting Japan for a few weeks, and even that short amount of time was enough to realize that the food I eat here in America is not up to the standards it should be.
Mr. Upton Sinclair is calling
Why I'll never buy Tyson foods ever again. So horrible and disgusting to watch Trumps Administration and CDC appointees back/enabled all of this. My heart broke for all those employees that had no choice. Its just wrong and inhumane.
Thank you for another sad episode of the series "Capitalism hurts people".
Read 'The Jungle ' It's still relevant.
I normally don’t buy frozen or prepackaged food now I will never even think about it. whenever a business claim to a family business it’s mean they are shit, I never trust anyone trying to sell me a service when he says family owned or family business or will treat you like family this mean they will FK me
Welcome back John
Ewww!
Well. Here’s yet another reason to go vegan. Now I have to figure out what to eat instead...
As someone who worked in one of the corporate offices during the recession of ‘08, I can tell you that these companies treat their office employees similar to plant employees. They discriminate against immigrants even when those said immigrants are the only ones with graduate degrees in the department. You don’t get promoted if you have an accent. Countryside VA accents are fine ;) Secretaries keep track of your bathroom breaks in the office also. Office work starts at 7am and goes until 4:30 or later. You can’t be 1 min late. I could go on and on. It really feels sickening.
Why is a person doing those cuts? It's the same cut over and over. Automate that shit. Not only is it dangerous for the person a robot can work at that speed and not cut his neighbor. So either slow down or automate.
America is disgusting
2 on trending! Good job john!
Donald Trump would be right at home with diaper wearing meat packers.
How about the quality standards of the food sold to prisons by these food companies? "we are legally allowed to sell rotten food to prisons. If they wanted clean food, those people wouldn't have gone to prison." --direct quote from a former boss years ago, just before I walked out. Keep digging.
Well just another reason I dont eat meat.
Go back to wherever it is you came from.....commie.  Please.
So how many of you after watching this, are counting themselves in on going plant based, or making a difference by cutting your meat consumption?  Let's end this by drying up the profits. Everyone of you has the power, to just say "No More". 🌱
Everyone can impact this situation by going vegan. Do it for the animals, do it for the workers, do it for yourself. Eat more plants, less meat, at least.
Rough estimate   700,000 total meat workers 60,000 covid in meat workers  12%  CDC reports 1 in 5 (20%) of the population infected with COVID  Don't come at me  I want these meat workers treated correctly... workers should work less (30 hrs is full time... that means they have to hire more people) and paid enough to live
very informative, thank you... I don't understand how these working conditions can be legal.
Covid death rate is less than 1%
I originally thought the commercial was for a euthanasia center, or a rabies vaccine/medication
this show is slowly losing its whimsey and is getting quite a bit darker and less funny since there has been no audience.
My dumbass history teacher used to watch this guy and think he’s funny, she also got a DUI
at least put a laugh track or something it sounds dry
go vegan
Totally Seth Meyersed it at the end
I used to date a girl who worked for a meat-packing company in Arkansas.  She worked with several other Micronesian girls.  Man, they treated those poor ladies like crap!
John, just shed light on the farmers protest in India
It's a race to the bottom, in corporate America.
Just.......sad.
I love your content! I wish to have an audience on my channel like you! Why don't you drop by my channel and rate any of the movies?
The unusual success probably nail because bibliography problematically detect for a sordid start. workable, physical millimeter
I also worked for a company that required you to file or sign an NDA nondisclosure agreement any time we saw another worker killed or who died in our workplace with threats of criminal prosecution if we violated the NDA and told anybody about what we saw.
aight, so i guess we're not talking about the big elephant in the room, or the elephants in the capitol i should say
Unblock content for Australia I hate paying for VPN just to see this.
I saw a similar video on Hasan minhaj show
Once again I'm so glad that I DON'T live in the US...
I don't give a fuck about the humans working there. The animals need better treatment. Even better, let's just dismantle the entire meat industry and replace it with lab grown meat
It’s called work for a reason. It’s hard dirty and dangerous. That’s why they are payed the big bucks. Keep on whining and Biden will sign an executive order to ban meat processing plants and everyone can go hungry. Nothing is perfect in this world. There’s a lot of things more screwed up here than meat processing like politics. Let the government run food production and processing  they will screw it all up.
But...we're family.
Reminiscent of “The Jungle” written by Upton Sinclair!  It brought attention to the horrors of the meat packing industry 100 years ago.
Saul Sanchez brought in more than 0.00003% of his household's annual income. JBS should have been fined a % of their annual income equal to his portion of his household's.
I worked for one company that regularly issued written statements to employees that said if you have an injury and file a Workmen’s Compensation claim we will do a blood test and if we find legal marijuana in your system you will be fired and billed for all your hospital fees. This was to discourage any of the employees who might consume marijuana of ever reporting injuries or seeking medical help.
Employee protection in the US - second only to China. And maybe North-Korea, if you call that working.
Automation is the key.  Anything tedious, mundane, and repetitive does not need to exist from 2021 and on.
You gave the answer around minute 7. Yes, this is bad. The world needs it though. So what is the solution? MACHINES. So having said that...you either shut it, or get replaced by the DEBONEANATOR 5000
I don’t give a damn. I will keep eating meat, and don’t u dare messing with that,  taxing meat or throat forcing Bill Gates “synthetic meat” on me
Nice to see someone actually do a story on this. The meatpacking industry has been a cesspool from top to bottom for a very long time.
It's crazy to see how in about 100 yrs we went from The Jungle to this
Boycott animal byproducts and go vegan. ✅
The USA is just a 3rd world country dressed in fancy clothes...
Stop buying meat.  It’s bad for humans and animals.
Shocking!!
late stage capitalism :(
Omg, no covid and no Trump! Finally!
Just read Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle" it describes the beginning of meatpacking. It's disgusting and the reason why American food killed more soldiers in the Spanish-American war than the Spanish soldiers
Upton Sinclair rolling over in his grave
Knew some people who worked at Tyson in a few different areas in Arkansas.  I heard some interesting stories.  Same thing at George's or any other food processing place.
A good reason to become a vegetarian..
This sounds like Into the Jungle.
It must be 1920, because this is the EXACT same issue that existed back then.
Is America great yet?
So we do have our own near slave labor still in america...its one of our last ones in america...this is why the meat and chicken is so cheap at times. Also why there was major covid-19 cases in the butchery places.
These people were considered essential workers from day one. I'm not surprised that there was this goofy betting pool on how many people would catch corona. Doesn't really even bother me.  Now, the rest of this is a bit disturbing. It's time for another modern release of "The Jungle."  Company offers former inmate a job, when few will. Still gets talked shit about for doing so, when it's convenient and suddenly it's predatory. Come on. Really?
I, too, am lower on the food chain than an aggressive pigeon 1:09
It wasn't always like this. They crushed the unions that made meat packing plants a good way for a working class person to support themselves and their families, honestly disappointed Oliver never once mentioned Unionization efforts.
11:18 PROPER COMEDIC TIMING, John, I do believe you're growing as a comedian.  Or someone gave you good advice!
So right to repair next
Without a union, workers simply have no power. Why are there no unions?
An industry that makes money from torturing and killing animals also treats their employees like crap? What a shock
See title ‘meatpacking’: instantly think , Adam Driver?
only 2 minutes in and he said meatpacking twice without making a joke about Adam Driver packing meat. I´m disappointed.
Could you please add your opening clip about the Texas Storm? I live in Texas and your summary was spot on and perfect. Would love to be able to share it with others.
I pray that everyone who sees this will become successful in life
that's so weird, I have never worked for a meat plant, I suspect there may be other jobs in this world.  If enough people quit, they would be forced to reevaluate their conditions.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2GYXdukX6OEIt1aoLJ2BTg
Late night TV show funny man. Pseudo intellectuals are destroying this country.
What's the batting average of Texas now?
Now I am going to sue you for giving me depression.
So they care about the corporate, upper middle class, majority white employees that do their dirty work from behind a desk.
This would be literally illegal on multiple counts in any European country... Yay for the "most civilized" country of the world...
stop eating meat!
Oliver’s favorite topic
death to capitalism yall. peace and luv <3333333333
Supply and demand. Who demands more meat? Who supplies it? Consumers need to do their part too. We really don't need to consume animal flesh every single day of the week.
We in Czech republic have similar issues. Thought there is just one difference. The owner of this industry is our prime minister. And just watch how we are “best in covid” (his words actually).
aw, come on...I came here to escape, not to be shown reality.....
I bet John packs a lot of meat haha, clever and original never before heard joke

John Oliver - vegan activist??!  Holy cow that's a good day to be alive!  Edit: wait no the meatpacking industry doesn't need to be reformed, it needs to be abolished!  Boycott the industry by NOT EATING MEAT!  That would solve so many problems.  I do like how intuitive you make socialism sound though.  Keep up the good work!
the jungle by upton sinclair, but make it the 21st century
This is the problem with both, lack of competition, and worker complacency!
what needs to be done is use machines to process the chickens, if they exist.
We need fucking UNIONS
A modern “The Jungle”
This industry needs automation badly. No human should do that job.
We are literally right back to being in The Jungle, any and all progress has been erased.
The solution is as easy as going vegan.
Upton Sinclair tried to warn us but no one listened.
namaste 😂
I stand with the meat factory. This video is bogus. Jokes. Thanks john. Now how to devote the rest of my life to make these meat factory owners lives a living hell.
This entire country has its people crippled for a few stakeholder dollars. We are run by a crony capitalist nightmare.
All big companies will tout their morals and values that's just a front for what they actually do. If they claim they're all about safety when it comes down to production or safety production always gets chosen. I worked at like 15 factories I know how the shit goes
Ahhhh, 1989. Back when Politicians knew what a bribe was. Now it's a "campaign contribution"  Weird how you can almost draw direct lines from huge issues today with corporate greed, illegality, and oversight to policies brought into law by leadership and not needs of the people. Wonder who they're working for now...
The pandemic really was a good time to become vegetarian.
The Joys of a capitalist's society... Screw the people to make a bit more money...
Biden won't do a fucking thing.
My college roommate worked for Tyson for 15 yrs in the computer department. Made good money. Then one day they moved 500 computer jobs overseas and he was out of a job. A real 'family' atmosphere at Tyson.
This kind of shit is what the people who voted for trump were fighting for
That's _Dame_ Judi Dench, Mr Oliver.
Can we just rename the show "Your Country Is Shit, And You Are All Assholes For Letting This Happen with John Oliver?"   Due to real talk?
Go vegan. Please.
I remember learning about the horrendous conditions of factories in the industrial revolution in middle school. Funny how it was all referred to as if that kind of stuff doesn’t happen anymore
I don't know guys. Today i can't take this episode.  Its too much
The movie "Fast Food Nation" touches on the subject of immigrants conditions on slaughterhouse/meatpacking industry, I recommend it.
What happened ...since when are you interested in Truth.  I know you make good $ but who Really writes your paycheck...... YOU CAN NEVER TELL THE TRUTH ON THAT.  RETURN TO ENGLAND PLEASE.  Disinformation !!!
Capitalism baby! Love it or die.  Please try to find a local butcher shop that sources local meat.
Mr. Oliver, I have missed you sir.
I'll do my small part by not buying anything made by or processed by Tyson. I already knew chicken processing plants have shit conditions, but not to the extent explained by this show. My entire diet is exclusively meat and eggs (save the preachy diet arguments), so I will be more vigilant on where exactly my meat comes from the next time I go to the grocery store.
And nothing’s going to change because these companies will just line politicians’ pockets to lobby against any regulations.
Namaste 🙏🏻
Just want to point out the death rate, based just on the infected of the meat plant and those who died. The death rate is .005%. Just sayin
I really don't understand why this blowhard is so popular!
okay, I'm going to reduce eating meat, fuck those companies.
I mean, the video title kinda gave it away.
capitalism poisons everything
Pilgrim for sure had a bird fetish
TIME TO GO VEGAN
I'm a vegetarian but i'll never stop a person from eating meat or ever run propaganda against meat. Meat is an essential part of life, always have been. For 200k years we relied on meat for our living and nothing's wrong with it. We eat meat out of our choice and we'll continue to do it and if someone stops us from doing that, then we'll kill that person and eat his/her/its/transhis meat.
Incredibly important and under-discussed topic. Cheap meat comes at a cost to our fellow man. Lessening your meat consumption and buying direct from local farmers are the only solutions.
I'm not some effete socialist that would get preyed upon by _a pigeon_ but I'm not sure I wouldn't be overpowered by a determined seagull.
7:20 - that's basicly being a worker in industrialization baby. capitalism, fuck yeah!
0:52 no what this family really need is the holy hand grenade!
hey screw that.....I don't want my chicken to go from $3.00 to $3.25....pfff....you think we're made of money!!
He uses the F-word too much.
Stop voting republican
Wow and i thought my company is shitty
No scathing reviews of bidens very clearly batshit crazy policies? Just doing that for the previous administration? Oliver is a mouthpiece of propaganda?
He did not mention the tragedy in Gainesville, GA
"Covered in blood and feces"? Maybe we can all just switch to black bean burgers. Is it really worth it people?
Gotta get those 2030 goals
So, were all good with a boycott, yeah?
This has been going on since the inception of meat packing. Workers are exposed to carcinogens from the meat, sicknesses, injuries, cancer, death, and all that is before they even eat any of it. That’s not to mention all the senseless slaughtering and animal cruelty going on.
Go vegan!
Judi Dench IS a fucking treasure
My mom is 58 years old, she work at mountair farms and she catched covid and had pneumonia,two days later me, my grandma and uncle we all got covid but thank god nothing worse happend this was in december and it was final exams week in my college, if my friends werent with me i would go insanly mad 🙏🏻
I don’t normally agree with most of John’s political views but when it comes to how corporations treat their staff at the lower end, I think he’s being way too nice. These people are modern day psychopaths. So many people have been killed, mutilated, or have sustained major injuries that most supervisors and higher ups have just grown numb to it. All they see is money, it’s a drug to them. They make so much that they fear what life would be like to have to struggle like the ones they are carelessly killing; they are afraid that they will end up like them, having to get a brutal job for pennies on the hour.
If it makes you feel any better, America, we do exactly the same shit here in Germany.
Go Vegan
You need new shirts that fit you!
Politicians: Industries will regulate themselves Industries mostly regulating themselves:
Despite being on a different side of the political spectrum to John Oliver, I really like the shows where this blatant exploitation of workers is shown. I really don’t give a shit if you’re white black yellow or blue people deserve to be treated with at least a baseline of respect and dignity and things like this are just unacceptable as it shows a massive disregard for human life. Cmon people this isn’t a partisan issue.
No wonder elon musk wanted to move to texas... it wasn't just for their tax rates...
capitalism baby!
This wouldn't have happened under Comrade Bernie. The US should've unionized 90 years ago
If Tyson fired some of their workers does that mean they will get deported?  Your researchers need to look a little further back on Tyson, about 20 years ago their southern indiana plant laid off all of their workers for a "renovation."  They were paying these workers to much some of them were making 10 bucks an hour.  They replaced them with illegal Mexican immigrants, that they shipped up from Mexico via Semi-tractor trailer.  Do you remember the Semi-tractor trailer that the coyote abandoned leaving the 60(?) immigrants to roast to death in Texas(?)  They were apparently being sent up to work at the southern indiana Tyson plant.  Since many of the immigrants didn't know how to read or write it made their training cheaper too; since they didn't need much time with the training manuals.   Unfortunately for them, this meant they didn't know the dangers of working near the ammonia vat(old laying hens need to be soaked in ammonia to soften the meat enough for people to eat, they become the little chicken chunks in Campbell's Chicken Soups.)  They didn't know how to use the gas masks that weren't provided.  Instead they just pulled their T-shirts up and used them as makeshift masks.  That was good enough for Southern Indiana standards.  Until they passed out and fell into the vats killing them.  Of course they weren't documented American citizens, so no pesky OSHA investigations or Lawsuits for negligent homicide occurred.  They just ordered another semi full of Mexicans to replace the dead ones.
Nice come back John and company. Nice good 2 episodes. I hope next episode you all come back to politics and criticism against the new administration, you know, like you did against trump for 4 years. That was ok, necessary, but this show is Democratic ¿right?
How would one of these plants fare if someone like John managed one of them? He’d have the whole place shut down during the pandemic, and when it finally opens in 2022,  they would never be able to operate in a capitalistic society. Just my 2 cents.
Currently reading The Jungle by Upton Sinclair which at the time was enough of a damning inditement of the meat packing industry that new federal regulations were immediately put in place. It's sad to think that a piece like this could be put on a format that anyone in the world could watch and nothing will probably come of it

Just Go Vegan. Its 2021. It's about time.
This is the world today. Go to work and act like a machine, so you can barely get by. This is dystopia.
We need a President that will come in and bust up all of the monopolies across the country, but that will never happen before we are taken over by China so let's just start learning mandarin now.
Another day in the United Corporations of America.
This is why meat is murder...
I wouldn't be shocked to find out that the JBS company had a life insurance policy on that employee of three decades. (Many large corporations do that, they claim it's part of their long term investment in employees, claiming it's a way to mitigate losses inured from having to replace them.)
You did a whole episode about packing meat without a reference to Adam Driver? I'm so proud of you.
... go vegan y‘all
If I start cutting out corrupt businesses, I feel like I'm left with the life of Jeremiah Johnson.
We in the general public can do something.  EAT LESS MEAT.  I am not completely vegetarian, but almost.  It's great!  I don't feel lethargic like after a meat-filled meal.  Try it!  And I love that I'm not propping up these vulgar companies.
go vegan or you are contributing to this :)
Down with Tyson
If I went to an interview where they said “our employees are more like family” I’d turn around and wheel out that door. It’s well known that business and family don’t go together well. Especially when those people ARE NOT your family and want to say they treat you like family. No thanks.
Nope. Not buying anything else to do with Tyson, or anyone else who has been trying to make profit from the torture of animals and humans. Now the product makes me nauseous, knowing this. Thanks.
Meatpacking is begging for an Adam Driver line...
Idk why other news media aren’t covering these issues besides these damn politics.
None of this surprised me. This is unfortunately regular under capitalism
Man, am I feeling depressed right now...
its capitalist exploitation all the way down
John Oliver, please voice a guided meditation! Haha
And there's more to it than this. After I read the book Fast Food Nation years ago I went veggie for five years. Many details in there about injuries....
@chad and jt go deep
me while watching this: "That is disgusting"
A lot of tip toeing around the fact that we should stop supporting such an inhumane industry not only to animals but also to the workers forced to work in disgusting conditions. Vote with your dollar and stop buying these products.
These poor people are the slaves, hired by Republicans, who put chicken on the Republicans table, but then are called rapists and drug dealers..
How about we make all "lobbyist" activity illegal in all forms of government, term limits for local, State and at federal levels for starters.
Imagine the price of meat if there were better conditions for workers, the animals, no federal subsidies, and taxes were added to compensate for the external costs like pollution. It would average $50 per pound. Plant proteins are more economical and ethical in every way.
Republicans do not want government oversight. It's no wonder considering any laws to protect workers will only decrease profit margins. I do not understand how the general population can consider that a good thing.
Meat processing plants are heralding in the day when robotics will replace humans. THEN, impose a robot tax and create a true utopia 🤔
I know they were bad before Trump, but like everything else he just made it worse by gutting OSHA
“We can begin the tour” 😂
it's like housing and landlords... Loyalty means nothing in america... even if you gave your whole life to a job...  Amazing how we the people forget we have the power..  sad for that - sad for all those families who get snubbed from a company that shows no empathy for those they employ (america)
Disappointed again. John never talks about cruelty towards animals in industrial farms/ meat plants , he keeps skipping the topic saying it is being already talked about a lot. No John it's not. You speaking on HBO about it would make a difference.
We are building a media organization and would like a talented people to contact us. If you have experience in video editing, narrating and managing a team please contact us. Thank you!
JO is arguably one of the most unfunny corporate mouthpiece hacks ever, Watch ol Carson clips to see what a pro is, Jo is a fool
Just throwing this out there, since I see arguments about veganism in the comments:  Animals waste a considerable portion of the energy they consume from plants. They burn energy moving, breathing, pooping, etc. To my understanding, any energy you obtained from meat required 7x more plants consumed than if you just ate the plants directly. It's inefficient.  So, suppose, just in theory, we all went vegan. We would cut down the need for the vast majority of our farmland, leaving vastly more room for forests and human developments. We would cut the need for this kind of dangerous menial work (Don't ask "what will happen to the jobs"; We'll be confronting that soon enough with machines replacing us anyway). We'd end the inhumane treatment of animals, too, but sadly you probably don't care, so screw that. In general it'd lead to a more efficient society.  And for you it'd be cheaper too. Remember, you are basically buying 7x less food. Yeah, meat is cheap (the price is kept artificially low). But it can't ever be as cheap as 1/7th of its components.  Not expecting yall to go vegetarian, but... keep this stuff in mind. It benefits you.
That had to be the worst commercial for ANYTHING, except maybe pest control/extermination services.
Watching this and it makes me remember that The Jungle by Upton Sinclair was meant to be a warning and not a 101 guide to re-create
This makes me want to go vegan tbh 😬
I feel like I am part of the problem.  I was interested up till 14:00, then i lost interest and wrote this post and left.  And that's a huge part of the problem....no one gives a shit so long as the meat comes down the line for cheap prices.  99% of me doesn't care, because I know nothing will come of this report, making it essentially useless.
Despite how often they say it, the company is NOT your family, the boss is NOT your friend. If he needed to sell the plant to buy another yacht, he'd fire all his "friends" and "family" faster than you could sneeze. Show the proper respect to your superiors, but there's no reason why the boos and an employee should spend time together outside of work. There is no reason at all to invite the boss to your house, he doesn't give a rat's ass about you.
Talk yo shit
this isn't news to me, but its nice to have all the info in the same place
So many industries and companies race to the bottom. Pretty soon it we’ll be the rich and the rest of us and guess who will be at the bottom
Fuck big corporations. Literally all of them.
Is this supposed to be funny???

Almost every company in America is the same. Salary employees are normally taken better care of, and hourly employees are treated like crap. It's a shame unions aren't making a comeback

yeah, let's eat meat, there's no trouble at all
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates⭕️
John, I love you and the Last Week Tonight team. I dunno what else to say, that sums everything up.   You guys really mean a lot to us viewers :)  This is like the Meatpacking horrors of the industry back in the 1800's... rat shit on the floors meat stored open. Now we got employees peeing into the food...  Really, we just need to ban factory farming. Every one of those places are just hot boxes of animal exploitation....  Also here's a thought, that you can't prove false either- every one of have probably eaten a piece of some poor worker that fell in the meat grinder and couldn't hop out... his toenails and hair are one with your burger >:[
It's really frustrating knowing that we just gave Democrats control of the government and they will still not do anything about this. Biden is never going to expand OSHA or do anything to change this.
unfunny.
Please stop eating meat, it's foul and disgusting on every level.
This is why people who don't really care about animals go vegan.
I'm hungry now.
There's a reason why deregulation ends badly... why even the situation in texas is another example of this... smh
Very good stuff covered here, BUT I still think one key fact remains unspoken: THE DEMAND DETERMINES THE SUPPLY. As long as consumers are willing to buy a $1.49 hamburger and expect to eat factory-farmed, dirt-cheap meat 3 times a day, things will only get worse in the ENTIRE supply chain.   And actually, I'd urge LWT to do a piece on the "grim conditions that animals face in factory farms" and not just to assume that "they do get talked about a lot".
I drove reefer truck for a couple years and has pickups  at both Greeley and the Waterloo plants quite a few times and I can back up everything Oliver just said. I can also add to it that the trailer yard at Waterloo is equally as bad in terms of safety. They had several(if not most) of the trailers dropped so close together I couldn't fit my pen in between them. I regularly picked up trailers there with smashed handles and doors. They are just plain doing too much volume and drunk on the money coming in. Most of which goes to administration instead of to the workers they abuse.
The learned certification anteriorly interfere because medicine nutritionally carve except a ill-informed softdrink. peaceful, incredible dedication
On Colbert, Oliver was labeled that he most like the Muppet Miss Piggy
Great Video!!!
I just tried chicken and waffle potato chips, OMFG! Nasty! My dog did not want them either

That "baseline" line..needs to apply for just about EVERY FEDERAL LAW!!! One size fits all, doesn't work...but we do need a set of minimum standards.
Sooooooooo the point of OSHA is.........
The "corporate wellness initiative" isn't for the corporate workers. Its so HR can go back to the insurance company and tell the company they offer these programs to help keep insurance rates down. The company will just pass off most rate hikes to the employees and deduct more for health insurance as part of their bi-weekly paycheck.
Do what I've done, go to a plant based diet!
The fact that the comments aren’t people turning green at the thought of meat packers wearing full diapers around their precious bacon and instead are furious about billionaires exploiting workers is a fairly good sign.    Sinclair said of people misinterpreting The Jungle as a report on the unsanitary conditions in meat packing plants “I aimed for American’s heart and hit them in the stomach.”  Now it’s time to concentrate that disgust into actions to break up these monopolies and ensure good working conditions by, I don’t know, turning them into worker CO-OPs.  And maybe start thinking about taxing billionaires out of existence to keep shit like this from happening again.
This is why I eat organic.
Shades of The Jungle by Upton Sinclair.   History repeats itself.
Next episode: Fudge Packing
I think I have PTSD from this episode! The horror... But thank you! We need to know. This has to be fixed NOW.
These companies have their own HMO nurse before you're finally sent to an HMO company
John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
GO VEGAN!!!
We talk about jobs that need no knowledge, no experience, no special abilities. Jobs that literraly anyone can do. Those jobs usualy doesn't pay much.
I cannot agree that the conditions in which animals are condemned to are widely discussed.  Since Upton Sinclair first wrote about the meat packing industry, conditions have only become worse.  If you want to know what really happens to animals and the people who work at the slaughterhouses read Eternal Treblinka by Charles Patterson. And then, at the very least, adopt a vegetarian lifestyle.
I worked in a poultry plant in the late 1980’s. No bathroom breaks and if you did take one outside of your lunch time you were sorry you did.  That and the level of sexual harassment were utterly ridiculous.  It’s not worth the pay or the benefits you make working for them.
Meat is brutal: brutal for the animals, brutal for the workers, brutal for the environment, brutal for your health.
It is the nature of American industry that every so often we recreate the circumstances inspiring Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle"
Workers rights? naaah.. Americans like cheap stuff - Why change that for good health, equality, security, prosperity, minimum wages, climate change, or just anything that involves thinking about the person next to you...
Shill
With every episode it is more and more clear John had to move to the US.... The stuff happening in the US is way, way below any standard in other third world countries, let alone Europe/UK.
Wannabe billionaires disliked this vid.   I swear some people will defend this crap.
Glad to see John got off the lets make every episode aboot Trump train.  Making the show Great Again by not doing Orange man bad every fucking episode.  Meow if we can only get him to look at the current idiot in office and have the same bias of hey ur fucking up and as a news esc show that seems to do a form of journalism were gonna hold ur feet to the fire to be accountable.  You know what the media is supposed to be, watchdogs of the politicians not their lap dogs.
HAHAHAHAHAHA  The last vegan strategy. After shaming people because they kill animals,  after shaming people because they eat animals, they shame people by accusing them of encouraging people mistreatment.
Yay I work down the street from that Tyson
So basically, the US criticising Russia and China for being bad countries, is like the town rapist criticising the town pedophile? cool.
This is why I’m vegan. It’s not just the animals, the workers are disgustingly exploited as well.
This is like that class video with guided questions... except it was actually entertaining 😂
Republicans are stripping everything down to take max profits across the board, even if it involves the Health and safety of its people. Republicans are so greedy they truly do not care or value humans or any living thing for that matter. We need the rich old white men who run fox news and oann and pretty much ALL REPUBLICANS TO KEEP SHOOTING THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT, AND THE PEOPLE NEED TO SPEAK UP, SO THEY WILL GO AWAY HOPEFULLY SOON. ITS 2021 NOW, NO LONGER 1945, people need to be treated better. GREED IS KILLING SOCIETY.

I have all notifications for this channel turned on and I didn't get one for this video. Fuck you YouTube.
What was left out of this is that this clearly shows why these corporations do not want undocumented workers to have a path to citizenship!
Stories like this definitely make me want to go vegetarian.
AT least I now know why noone in the US eats raw pork.
Corporations and the lobbyists they pay for have policymakers by the balls. It's ruining the country slowly but surely.
Tyson workshop in corporate offices, yeah...really helps the factory workers.
"Meatpacking" is also code for a media that fortifies democracy.🤔
haha. Murica.
And you can be sure that the CEO’s eat organic, pasture-raised. I know this because I am a private chef!
Youtube Trending team saying yeahhh let's just make this video #1 trending
I'm so grateful to have this video as a robust and succinct explanation when I am asked by folks why I chose a plant-based diet, and how I wanted to do it for humans as much as animals. I have no clue what it would look like for all these jobs to be repurposed for plant-based production though; farming can be brutal as well, and can take advantage of people in similar ways. I imagine there's slightly less possibility of injury though? Regardless, it's a human/business problem through and through.
Another good reason for "No Meat Monday"  PETA/Paul McCartney "Glass Walls"  If you think meat packers have it tough, (and they do indeed) you ought to see how the animals are treated.
ewww so what's american meat like then
I used to work with AMAZON. This is common practice ALL the time by warehouses like them and production lines like Jabil Circuit as well. The bosses don't give two shits if you have to use the bathroom.
Instead of "meatpacking" this could just be titled "capitalism"
I dont understand how Americans always make a big deal about slavery that happened a long time ago when they have, right now, slaves in Amazon ware houses, Apple subcontracted repair facilities, meat Packaging facilities, harvesting their crops, etc. Its like Latinos, Asians and poor people are invisible. You guys rather protest for the rights of the freaking chickens rather than these people, but i guess is not trendy and one in America would protest and burn buildings that will make their packages to arrive at a later date..
We can stop eating meat.
That’s why unions are important.
Gods and to think I work 2 blocks away from that damn JBS plant
An excerpt from "Fastfood Nation" by Eric Schlosser. Published on January 17, 2001:  Kenny Dobbins was a Monfort employee for almost sixteen years. He was born in Keokuk, Iowa, had a tough childhood and an abusive stepfather, left home at the age of thirteen, went in and out of various schools, never learned to read, did various odd jobs, and wound up at the Monfort slaughterhouse in Grand Island, Nebraska. He started working there in 1979, right after the company bought it from Swift. He was twenty-four. He worked in the shipping department at first, hauling boxes that weighed as much as 120 pounds. Kenny could handle it, though. He was a big man, muscular and six-foot-five, and nothing in his life had ever been easy.  One day Kenny heard someone yell, "Watch out!" then turned around and saw a ninety-pound box falling from an upper level of the shipping department. Kenny caught the box with one arm, but the momentum threw him against a conveyer belt, and the metal rim of the belt pierced his lower back. The company doctor bandaged Kenny's back and said the pain was just a pulled muscle. Kenny never filed for workers' comp, stayed home for a few days, then returned to work. He had a wife and three children to support. For the next few months, he was in terrible pain. "It hurt so fucking bad you wouldn't believe it," he told me. He saw another doctor, got a second opinion. The new doctor said Kenny had a pair of severely herniated disks. Kenny had back surgery, spent a month in the hospital, got sent to a pain clinic when the operation didn't work. His marriage broke up amid the stress and financial difficulty. Fourteen months after the injury, Kenny returned to the slaughterhouse. "GIVE UP AFTER BACK SURGERY? NOT KEN DOBBINS!! a Monfort newsletter proclaimed. "Ken has learned how to handle the rigors of working in a packing plant and is trying to help others do the same. Thanks, Ken, and keep up the good work."  Kenny felt a strong loyalty to Monfort. He could not read, possessed few skills other than his strength, and the company had still given him a job. When Monfort decided to reopen its Greeley plant with a nonunion workforce, Kenny volunteered to go there and help. He did not think highly of labor unions. His supervisors told him that unions had been responsible for shutting down meatpacking plants all over the country. When the UFCW tried to organize the Greeley slaughterhouse, Kenny became an active and outspoken member of an anti-union group.  At the Grand Island facility, Kenny had been restricted to light duty after his injury. But his supervisor in Greeley said that old restrictions didn't apply in this new job. Soon Kenny was doing tough, physical labor once again, wielding a knife and grabbing forty- to fifty-pound pieces of beef off a table. When the pain became unbearable, he was transferred to ground beef, then to rendering. According to a former manager at the Greeley plant, Monfort was trying to get rid of Kenny, trying to make his work so unpleasant that he'd quit. Kenny didn't realize it. "He still believes in his heart that people are honest and good," the former manager said about Kenny. "And he's wrong."  As part of the job in rendering, Kenny sometimes had to climb into gigantic blood tanks and gut bins, reach to the bottom of them with his long arms, and unclog the drains. One day he was unexpectedly called to work over the weekend. There had been a problem with Salmonella contamination. The plant needed to be disinfected, and some of the maintenance workers had refused to do it. In his street clothes, Kenny began cleaning the place, climbing into tanks, and spraying a liquid chlorine mix. Chlorine is a hazardous chemical that can be inhaled or absorbed through the skin, causing a litany of health problems. Workers who spray it need to wear protective gloves, safety goggles, a self-contained respirator, and full coveralls. Kenny's supervisor gave him a paper dust mask to wear, but it quickly dissolved. After eight hours of working with the chlorine in unventilated areas, Kenny went home and fell ill. He was rushed to the hospital and placed in an oxygen tent. His lungs had been burned by the chemicals. His body was covered in blisters. Kenny spent a month in the hospital.  Kenny eventually recovered from the overexposure to chlorine, but it left his chest feeling raw, made him susceptible to colds and sensitive to chemical aromas. He went back to work at the Greeley plant. He had remarried, didn't know what other kind of work to do, still felt loyal to the company. He was assigned to an early morning shift. He had to drive an old truck from one part of the slaughterhouse complex to another. The truck was filled with leftover scraps of meat. The headlights and the wipers didn't work. The windshield was filthy and cracked. One cold, dark morning in the middle of winter, Kenny became disoriented while driving. He stopped the truck, opened the door, got out to see where he was-and was struck by a train. It knocked his glasses off, threw him up in the air, and knocked both of his work boots off. The train was moving slowly, or he would've been killed. Kenny somehow made it back to the plant, barefoot and bleeding from deep gashes in his back and his face. He spent two weeks at the hospital, then went back to work.  One day, Kenny was in rendering and saw a worker about to stick his head into a pre-breaker machine, a device that uses hundreds of small hammers to pulverize gristle and bone into a fine powder. The worker had just turned the machine off, but Kenny knew the hammers inside were still spinning. It takes fifteen minutes for the machine to shut down completely. Kenny yelled, "Stop!" but the worker didn't hear him. And so Kenny ran across the room, grabbed the man by the seat of his pants, and pulled him away from the machine an instant before it would have pulverized him. To honor this act of bravery, Monfort gave Kenny an award for "Outstanding Achievement in CONCERN FOR FELLOW WORKERS. The award was a paper certificate, signed by his supervisor and the plant safety manager.  Kenny later broke his leg stepping into a hole in the slaughterhouse's concrete floor. On another occasion, he shattered an ankle, an injury that required surgery, and the insertion of five steel pins. Now Kenny had to wear a metal brace on one leg in order to walk, an elaborate, spring-loaded brace that cost $2,000. Standing for long periods caused him great pain. He was given a job recycling old knives at the plant. Despite his many injuries, the job required him to climb up and down three flights of narrow stairs carrying garbage bags filled with knives. In December of 1995, Kenny felt a sharp pain in his chest while lifting some boxes. He thought it was a heart attack. His union steward took him to see the nurse, who said it was just a pulled muscle and sent Kenny home. He was indeed having a massive heart attack. A friend rushed Kenny to a nearby hospital. A stent was inserted in his heart, and the doctors told Kenny that he was lucky to be alive.  While Kenny Dobbins was recuperating, Monfort fired him. Despite the fact that Kenny had been with the company for almost sixteen years, despite the fact that he was first in seniority at the Greeley plant, that he'd cleaned blood tanks with his bare hands, fought the union, done whatever the company had asked him to do, suffered injuries that would've killed weaker men, nobody from Monfort called him with the news. Nobody even bothered to write him. Kenny learned that he'd been fired when his payments to the company health insurance plan kept being returned by the post office. He called Monfort repeatedly to find out what was going on, and a sympathetic clerk in the claims office finally told Kenny that the checks were being returned because he was no longer a Monfort employee. When I asked company spokesmen to comment on the accuracy of Kenny's story, they would neither confirm nor deny any of the details.  Today Kenny is in poor health. His heart is permanently damaged. His immune system seems shot. His back hurts, his ankle hurts, and every so often he coughs up blood. He is unable to work at any job. His wife, Clara-who's half-Latina and half-Cheyenne, and looks like a younger sister of Cher's-was working as a nursing home attendant when Kenny had the heart attack. Amid the stress of his illness, she developed a serious kidney ailment. She is unemployed and recovering from a kidney transplant.  As I sat in the living room of their Greeley home, its walls decorated with paintings of wolves, Denver Broncos memorabilia, and an American flag, Kenny and Clara told me about their financial condition. After almost sixteen years on the job, Kenny did not get any pension from Monfort. The company challenged his workers' comp claim and finally agreed-three years after the initial filing-to pay him a settlement of $35,000. Fifteen percent of that money went to Kenny's lawyer, and the rest is long gone. Some months Kenny has to hock things to get money for Clara's medicine. They have two teenage children and live on Social Security payments. Kenny's health insurance, which costs more than $600 a month, is about to run out. His anger at Monfort, his feelings of betrayal, are of truly biblical proportions.  "They used me to the point where I had no body parts left to give," Kenny said, struggling to maintain his composure. "Then they just tossed me into the trash can." Once strong and powerfully built, he now walks with difficulty, tires easily, and feels useless, as though his life were over. He is forty-six years old.  A Quick Update: Kenny Dobbins passed away at the age of 58 on May 17th, 2014. Please read Fastfood Nation.
For those of you who almost certainly wont it is LESS THAN .5%...  YouTube wouldn't let me put these two comments together xD fucking ridiculous
The owl looks just like Bo.
Our society is built on human suffering. We've done a lot to alleviate it but it isn't gone and we aren't done.  It's disheartening seeing these and knowing that each and every battle needs to be fought separately because we can't agree on the basic principle that humans are worthy of a care and compassion.
Idk why people are always surprised to find out shit is happening in the US like HELLO NEWS FLASH there’s always something shitty going on here. We aren’t the best country in the world, stop being so gullible and brainwashed. The corruption here is at the highest levels and just because it hasn’t affected your day to day life doesn’t mean it isn’t affecting someone else’s.
So ya tho that diaper claim only had one source and it’s been disputed so oxfam is kinda iffy sometimes
the fact that zimmerman is still alive in Florida is crazy
And Trump increased maximum meat processing speed before he left office. I wonder if that won over any Republican blue collar workers... Or if they noticed him screwing them over at all.
Tip to anyone entering a new work situation or finding themselves deep in one where the employer loves saying "we are family". They are not your family. Abusers often use this type of familiarity to hold expectations of you that are not acceptable in a workplace.
America is not a country, it's a company.
Or people could just not eat meat.
I worked at the bmw plant in South Carolina its not much better there. I seen and heard some crazy shit
#Bidenmercia
Lol he’s trending #1
This is the failure of Capitalism, and one of the first failures of Capitalism was documented in the 1880s.
Surprise it’s 1906 and Teddy Roosevelt is alive and we gotta talk about the meat packing industry
maybe the line wouldn't have to move so fast... if all of those obese people who were part of this piece...slowed down the line of food entering their body
I like John Oliver's segments, especially the one about the meatpacking plants and how they treat their workers.  I understand his need to effectively accentuate the points he makes.  I just wish there were a way to do it without using the f word so much.
Saw a guy’s foot open once at FedEx. Their manager came out and said he didn’t need an ambulance (so the treatment was just first aid/no OSHA report). This video reminds me of those days.
I REALLY HATE WATCHING YOUR SHOW, cuz its SO FUCKING frustrating to see all the crappy shit going on in the world and knowing that there's really nothing that I can do to help change things.... that said I do FUCKING love your show!!!
no offense but vegans have been saying this stuff for years but bc it’s coming from a vegan people immediately shut down and speak over us to justify why they’re still gonna eat meat...it’s easy to laugh at vegans online but we just want justice for animals and the marginalized people forced to slaughter them so they can provide for their families...
fuck this Im going vegan
I 100% thought that Miss Piggy's leg was a penis.
46 seconds in and I have no idea what the fuck that commercial was about.. and I own guinea pigs
tyson should be boycotted
late-night show hosts stepping on a political soapbox and YouTube rewarding it simply because they are late-night show hosts is one of the things I hate most on this platform..
Slavery may be abolished but...is it? Is it really? One group taking advantage of another group sounds familiar.
A solution to this and the last video is to be vegan
That would motivate me to find a local alternative, or raise my own meat chickens if I could.
Tyson Covid Farms chicken 🤮🤮
U.S.A is really a third world country.
Just the fucking name meat packing is the industry’s way of saying “fuck you America. We know your going to eat our product no matter what we do. We can shit on it, spill our workers human blood on it. Force our workers to show up no matter how sick even if they puke on the product”. I think TV personalities should have to wear diapers and take no bathroom breaks. Politicians too. Remember to get a brown colostomy bag to match your shoes.
How about we just stop exploiting animals??
Texas is a Sh1t Hole! This is bad. The Pandemic made it worse. Winter Showed the state for What it really Effing IS.  Big Steaks and Big Mistakes! Texans are mostly idiot cowpokes, free and home on the range... independent... until they actually have to DO SOMETHING - that does not involve drinking and complaining. Good Luck Texas!
I’ve been banning Poultry and pork processors for over ten years. It can be done, just opt for responsibly farmed and eat less. 4 ounces is a healthy portion . Balance with grains and vegetables. It’s healthier for your family and the planet. These operations are like one huge wet market. If we are worried about Covid, beware of our own wet markets.
this is exactly why (as a non-vegan myself - soy allergy) non-vegans that shit on vegans and veganism frustrate the hell out of me. they're not just fighting for the end of animal exploitation, they're also fighting to end the human exploitation in it as well. you can't say you're anti-exploitation and still defend unnecessarily contributing to the factory farming industry, nor make fun of/disparage the plant-based lifestyle. you're either for exploitation, or not - there's no middle ground, people.
True ,this is like  the dif of working at  Corporate  Amazon  ( Seattle) vs Any Amazon warehouse job .
Who is downvoting these? GOP nutbags? Or managers at the meat plants?
Shady Corporations                         Cults                                              🤝                                   "We're family"
John has officially become a real muckraker, I'm so proud ;D
Go vegan!
Why do peaply without any morals also tend to lack any good taste in everything else in their life?
I love how he brought back the judgmental bitch at the end to make a proper point
That bit about Christmas presents being bribes for children of divorce hit pretty hard.
The decimation of government institutions to allow private industry to flout safety violations has been a GOP strategy for years. A good examination of this is found in the book "The Fifth Risk" by Michael Lewis.
This is so messed up. If only there was a way for companies to be democratically ran by its workers, and for them to have stake in the company. That would be a way better type of capitalism
Murica...
This is straight out of The Jungle
Once again, "shareholder value" above all else. Unrestrained capitalism is a beast that can never be satiated.
two words: modern slavery. Thank God I was born in Europe and not in the US
This video covers every reason i went vegetarian. Workers rights are more important than a hamburger.
Every time I hear that "we're family" crap from a corporation I throw up a little in my mouth..
People truly are disgusting
Good luck getting OSHA rebuild with "no corporate donor left behind" Biden in charge... I use "in charge" loosely, of course
1.7 K people are upset because their thoughts are scattered from sitting behind a desk all day. 😥
Support plant based alternatives if you want to end the suffering of animals and human animals.
A major corporation that uses corporate speak to insinuate that they care about you when they don't really unless it benefits themselves somehow?! I've never heard of such a thing in my life! Next you're gonna tell me there's supervisors out there that try to make this better by simply buying their employees pizza every once in a while.
The Mob, gangs, and the cartels all consider each other "family" you can guess how they treat their members who don't perform or follow the rules.
let the rats get frustrated,
It’s like what we learn about the industrial revolution with immigrants working in unsafe factories in the 1800s
yo anyone ever read The Jungle
Keep your job? Relieve yourself online. And the worker is to blame? That is the true disgusting part. To feel that you have to do that. Still want deregulation? This is what working conditions were like before the original unions in the US. This country needs a big change.
Don't buy meat.
Take the company, and give it to the workers, to co-own and decide how to operate. The owners and directors who have made the unsafe decisions possible? Kicked out. No compensation. Their fine for killing human beings is the entire company. Goodbye.
Finally we talking about food workers 🙌🏽
Shitholes, I know because I've worked at one and damn near died slipping on ice near steep steps.
just another day of grifting.
Damn I got 15,000 for my pinky that's ridiculous.
So meat packing factories have basically turned into Amazon warehouses
John, your immersion-blender storage is dangerous. Please make sure to cover the blade while not in use. Think of it as using a condom anytime Except when you're robot-fucking that soup.
Well, that escalated quickly.....
Fuck ...
Meat Workers already have abysmal working conditions here in Germany, but in America where everything relating to Workers rights is labeled Communism, it was clear that its a different level of hell
The best way to reduce these meatpacking issues is simple: close them down. We need dead animals on our plate like we need more cancer, more heart disease, i.e. like a hole-in-the head. One would have to be a total moron not to understand the horrors of animal ag and these pandemic factories. SHUT 'EM DOWN, une fois pour toutes!
My aunt caught covid cause the meat packing place she worked at didn't let people who were sick take off.
Everybody wanted capitalism.  Well this is what we get. And things will keep getting worse and worse under this absolutely failed ideology of capitalism.
Actually guys capitalism is good
.God imagine if instead of the hamster, it was the cat...!         you be dead!
The same things are happening in grocery stores around the country, kroger Walmart. Everything.  I had been living with someone who had covid, so I told my bosses at one of these companies, and they told me I had to keep working until I got a positive test back.  We have had 5 large outbreaks, the temp guns they use are calibrated to show lower temps, I’m talking like 90 degrees. And you have to have 100 to go home. They made us work through the Oregon wildfire smoke, and refused to close the doors. My bosses even told me that wearing a mask doesn’t help prevent me from getting smoke in my lungs. The country is in shambles. But in the mean time essential workers get nothing, and we are last in line to get the vaccine in most states.
And people wonder why we need Government regulation so badly? An entirely Free Market SUCKS...corporations will, and have historically always, taken every advantage to turn a profit at the expense of everyone and everyTHING else.
Fuck Sanderson Farm. I worked in debone as a shoulder cutter and then as QC. They do not want worker unions
The answer is simple to factory farming.  Eat less meat.  Eat vegetarian.  Go Vegan.
John "Upton Sinclair" Oliver a modern muckraker
6:25 A lot of this is because for some reason the largest political party has managed to convince half of us that patriotism doesn't mean working hard to make sure your country and it's citizens are cared for and have the best chances of success and it's instead about how many times you can salute the flag and tell cancer patients to pull themselves up by their boot straps and how many people you can give life sentences for having an ounce of weed on them. I get so tired of this idea that if so much as a cent of our tax money goes into something other than turning palestinian kids into skeletons and bailing out the rich then it's somehow socialism and will be our ruin while we watch our own citizens starting gofundme's for life saving surgery and listen to the rest of the world doubled over laughing at how backwards and stupid we are. We get taxed basically on par with other first world countries and yet we get crumbling roads, underfunded schools, and a healthcare system from the 1800s.
holy crap number one on trending great job john
All in favor, Strongly I.
The question is not why america is the greatest country in the world but why is america is the best third world country
Worst kind of comedy is this sitting at a desk like your news bullshit.
Sad thing is I have been to almost every plant named in this episode.
After the last two episodes of Last Week Tonight I get the feeling we might wanna start overthinking meat consumption..
Now I want to reread fast food nation.
Is this USA or Nicaragua?
I didn't eat meat today!  Also I'm not American
A company that exists to mindlessly slaughter millions of animals a day doesn't care about humans either? Go Figure
#1 on trending. Good. Let the world see that we are a failed state. 🖕🏻🇺🇸🖕🏻
We are (dysfunctional) family
Bo Pilgrim had a replica of the very first Baptist church in America built on my college campus. I think it had some fancy name, but I've only ever heard people call it the Chicken Chapel.
go vegan. it solves all of that.
People that say "surely not (in) our country'" when it comes to doing evil and upsetting things, are the ones i want to slap the most. Naïve and closeminded.
5:58 absolute shit wypepo says.  AlwaysHaveBeen.jpg
Our company is like a family. A slaveholding family!
Another good reason to be a vegetarian or buy local humanely raised and butchered meat.
We just need to ban meat. It's bad for the animals, bad for people and bad for the planet.
This hit too close to home for me. I interned at the corporate offices of a meat packaging company doing POINTLESS work them and still making more money than the factory workers who were actually making the companies product. It hurt to see POC putting in back breaking work for very little money while I got to sit at a desk
And yet another reason why I went plant based...I want nothing to do with this nonsense.
And people wonder why some agree with things Karl Marx said
Today its my birthday and im sad
I still ain't eating no synthetic meat. F*** Bill Gates and ur New World Order
I worked at a poultry factory in Canada. It's a big country, so experiences may vary. Employees had regular rotations down the line and across departments to diversify physical movements, break the monotony, and reduce the likelihood of developing any long term injuries, there were one or two employees per department who did bathroom replacements so that each employee could go relieve themselves or just take some time off the line in addition to the breaks that were already planned, anyone could raise their hands for emergencies and be replaced immediately out of sequence. People with injuries would be referred to outside specialists and given light duty tasks that they would be comfortable doing in the meantime. Abuse of the system was minimal, with me only suspecting one person of doing so long term, and a stupid kid in the short term who magically had no problems playing hockey tournaments after work. We had independent federal inspectors on site at all times, and veterinarians to ensure no diseased animals were entering the food chain. The only bad stuff was with respect to peer pressure to not report minor injuries when working as a temporary summer contractor, with full-time employees claiming this would kill any chances of being asked back next year, or being hired in full time. Whether this was actually true, I don't know. My experience in the meat sector in my neck of the woods was overwhelmingly positive. I should also point out that by "injuries" I'm 99.99% referring to hand or wrist pain derived from repetitive movements that was caught early. Nothing crazy. People had safety shoes, Kevlar sleeves, a chainmail glove, and chainmail upper body protection and I can't recall a single stabbing incident that resulted in blood being drawn. The production rates cited at the beginning of the piece sound excessively high for a single line consisting entirely of human workers.
I was in that betting pool at the Tyson plant
This is weird. I commented on his last episode that I didn't need another reason to go vegan...but here we are, again....
Good ol USA!
I remember when this dude was funny instead of a Leftist's wet dream come true
So you're saying it's safer to join the military or become a police officer, than to work in a meatpacking joint.  Hell, join the mob. At least there is some form of accountability there.  You'll still end up dismembered one day with little hope of retirement, but it likely pays a lot better, and maybe one day someone will make a terribly acted movie about your gang exploits.
Damn
Is this really cheaper than just using machines?
How many more reasons needed to go vegan?
God damn, working for a company for more than 30 years and getting killed by then as a bonus. America's great
I wish these airheaded interviewers would ask "do the employees at Tysons meat packing plants get to do stuff like this?" And broadcast the response. And everybody else working there just go along with it screw whatever higher ups say.
as much as i like to eat meat, the way they treat it makes me never want to eat meat again, no wonder socialism is on the raise way to go places that claim they are business but do that to there employees way to go
same problem here in germany. The meat industry is the worst; for animals and employees.
This style of show just doesn’t hit the same if it’s not Andrew Shultz
Americans need labour unions
Sad to say that I was eating Tyson chicken tenders while watching this. Just had one of those "Oh shit" moments.
This show is so depressing lately. I thought this was supposed to be a comedy?
The poised philosophy tinctorially develop because river previously embarrass than a abundant cicada. dark, unhealthy mexico
There is another looming issue that is off this subject: Automatiion. The meat packing industry is experimenting with robot butchers. Robot butchers do not need toilet breaks. They don't get sick. They don't get accidentally cut by their neighbors. From a human well-being idea, a robot butcher is a good idea. But the human problem is: Lots of lost jobs.
We did a betting pool  at my gas station. Of course it was the employees not the managers xD.
Happy for this information. None of these companies will ever get a dime from me again.
I just want to say, thank you so much for covering this topic. My dad, an immigrant, worked at a meat packing facility for 23 years, and when he finally was experiencing extreme pain and swelling in his hand from the deboning process and other related injuries, they fired him after an on site doctor said his injuries were not work related. My father sued the company and won, but he now has the live out his years in pain. Edit: Thank you for all of the kind comments and wishes in the replies ❤️
It sounds like they want Trump to never mentioned again, just lost in the fucking history

This made it all the way up to #1 trending today? Brilliant. People need to hear this.  This little comment is going to do what little it can to keep this video trending just a little bit longer.
This is why Gen Z is starting to turn to socialism.
One of the many reasons I quit eating any and all meat 4 years ago.
Ok. So fire everyone and use robots! That'll work!....
My fiance works for Tyson in Albany, Kentucky, and almost all of this is 🐎💩. 🙄🙄🙄
Ok. John Oliver. I take umbrage with your importance list. I was going to let it slip, but I just can't. You listed Judi Dench at number 3, and there was NO mention of Maggie Smith. She's also a National Treasure. Don't you dare leave out Maggie.
Finally, able to enjoy LWT without being flooded with political messages the whole time. I watch to escape from the world not be reminded how f-ed we are
#1 on trending? Wow
If you like meat,  go harvest it yourself.  Fuck these big companies.  Get in touch with your food, you'll appreciate the animal and respect yourself more.  Trust me
Capitalism is inherently rotten, you cannot build upon a system that rewards hoarding money and cutting corners, i wonder when will we rise and make jan 6th on each of these millionaires houses.
The world would be a better place without plants processing dead bodies of innocent beings
Thank you for taking the time to expose these companies. I know of workers in poultry plants who are subject to awful working conditions. They are threaten by employers, laughed at because they don't work fast enough, if they go to the bathroom they loose points and taken to a closed room and are yell at. Some female workers have shared not to be able to hold her babies because of overexertion and severe workplace injuries.
Thank you for the report. I'm so glad it's trending on YouTube. Haven't eaten meat for years because of the unethical working conditions and because of the environmental affects on our ecosystems. Factory workers need reparations!!
idk oliver's jokes were kinda lame today lol
You and Stephen have fallen so far.  Just no comedic value.  Oh well, you can always follow Phil Hartman and Robin Williams to stay relevant.
I have never seen that Perdue ad, but it is so WTF that I will remember it. And by that, I mean, 20 years from now, I will still be remembering it. That means the ad worked.
A story line only made up by the minds of this guy's writer's with nothing better to do than produce fictitious info to be on HBO as a non American show with a British guy with no facts... except to say it's a fact....I have some nice land to buy in north Florida...real good property maybe a little swampy but it's good for English
Consumers need to go vegan. Simple. Nothing will change until the consumers stomp out the demand.
I been waiting for this report for a longtime thank you john.
Should we stop eating animals?
I would genuinely love to see a meatpacking plant-episode of Undercover Boss. The toilet break in the diaper, the 35 birds a minute workline rate,  the visit to the nurse with three executive fingers in a plastic bag..
People may demonise unions but this is what they fight for: safe work place, faire wages, good infrastructure. It’s always corporate hq that gets all the fancy cushy perks, but little guy, the bone weary blue collar person who cannot afford a day off: they’re forgotten, mistreated and maligned
This is why I'm a certified butcher.
Well this is just another reason I no longer buy meat that come from commercial farms. I'll stick with small and actual family farms.
so the white workers got yoga and meditation classes, while the Hispanics got cut/amputations/large medical bills....hmm, not racist at all, said no one ever
Any business or company that says "we're a family" means they're going to break you mentally and attempt to leave you physically worse off then you where before you started working for them.
Meatpacking hehe
America urgently needs to tone down its capitalism behaviour, it's beyond madness.  Workers have to urinate while packing food so that they don't lose their job is disgusting.  Remember Amazon's bear spray accident and a worker dying on its warehouses while other continued to just work around the corpse?  Well the world remembers all those horrible things occurring in the name of Capitalism.   Capitalism is good but now your abusing it Big Time!   By the way and most importantly stop your Racism in the workplace. TYSON is  treating the "White's" in corporate better than the "workers (Blacks & Latin Americans)" like crap in both wages and treatment .  The world is sick and tired of your Racism
" We are family" is one of the most bullshit slogans corporations use. I've worked many places and many of them exploit the shit out of their "family".
Yay capitalism...
hello
I need to watch John Oliver on 0.8x speed
This meat packing labour disaster is really gross.  Also I noticed how unfunny John is without his head nodding laugh track style audience.   I mean, he is not funny, not even a little bit.   That stupid Purdue ad? is more funny than John by accident.
And still many Americans never tire of boasting about their country as „leader of the free world“. Yeah, no. Was annoying back then, is ridiculous now. Hurtful for all the lovely american people I met along my way.
Charlie Chaplin covered this in 1936, in "Modern Times". Nobody cared for 85 years. It's not going to change now.
Time to unionize
What a stupid advertisement!!!!
In the same way that the gun regulation debate is ruined by the NRA people, this debate is being ruined in the comments by insufferable vegans. Talking specifically to you, DiahRhea and Jankmaster.
And we send billions overseas and we can't get our shit together
What in the heck was that ad at the start with a guinea pig lol!!!!! haha
The video I watched before this video had one of those folksy, down-home on the ranch commercials for the beef industry.
America, land of the free? More like land of the heavily mistreated workers, where the average joe gets poorer and poorer and the wealthy get richer and richer and don't give a fuck about their employees from whom their wealth comes from. That's what you get with poorly regulated capitalism, if regulated at all. I was once interested in visiting America, but that train has departed for quite some time now. It's sad to think that South Americans have to chose to migrate to the States, hoping for a better life when this kind of stuff is awaitng them, because their situations in their native country are more dire, more dangerous and without hope, than having to migrate to the States and live under such conditions. Sometimes human societies are simply disgusting and heartbreaking.
E Corp is going to rot in the ground.
John has really made two videos in a week about terrible practices in the meat industry and has yet to suggest reducing meat intake as part of a solution...
what the heck is wrong with that guinea pig
And then people wonder why I've cut back on my meat consumption
There was no reason to keep that guys face on screen when you were ranting 13:20. Trash move
Family, as in "The CEO is the patriarch ruling over it with an iron fist, and you are the red-headed step child that will get the belt if you mouth off, and you'll get kicked out of the house if you come out as gay."
The Jungle, Upton Sinclair
Eat less meat everyone
that was a good fk'n report
I work for unemployment and I've had quite a few claimants fired for pissing in a food factory. Down drains... in their uniform and ignoring it... in a garbage can...
The prodigal son returns!!
The US should automate the entire process. These companies should be allowed access to capital through long term loans.
I was eating chicken while watching this video god help me. 5:20
I really thought Adam Driver was gonna be above him on the food chain but was bitterly disappointed it was a medium-aggressive pigeon instead
wut
I grew up in fairbuilt Minnesota, and so many of the people who worked in the Tyson plant were immigrants who were treated like shit
worlds richest third world country and texas as it's spearhead
Current Year
When politicians fight against even the idea that regulations exist, it’s shit like this that they’re endorsing.
Oliver is fucking back. Yea.
I'm from Pittsburg, TX. Home of the Bo Pilgrim bust.  Thank you for this story.
Does this twonk really need to be cursing on tv? Ugly muppet
The more I watch this show the more I wonder why anyone even lives in America
I love that commercial.
More depressing facts with British bird boy John Oliver
Sadly, if humans can't accept those conditions and want change, then eventually a machine will be there to replace them.
Did  you hear that? Yeah, that. If you listen closely you can still hear it echoing across that land. There it is. This morning, immediately following this latest slap down delivered by the US Supreme Court rose the loudest, most fear-filled 'OH FUCK! to roll across the land in quite some time. The source of this bellow was the x-resident of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue: one Donald J. Trump. What a great sound. So much more beautiful than even the sounds of long-over due and most welcome sound of spring birds signalling the end to an exceptionally long and extraordinarily bleak Winter. There was a seasonal change that took place earlier this morning. The sun is about to shine a whole lot more in the coming days and weeks - you can be sure of that. And it is going to grow extremely uncomfortable for the guy to tried so desperately to prevent this sun from rising.
Hasn't changed one bit since the jungle has been written. Huh.
Maybe revisit "The Jungle" which helped spark for the last reform.
Is there a John-Oliver-for-Kids-and-Pearl-Clutchers channel that edits these episodes? Would love to be able to share them more widely!
All the more reason to nix animal products from your diet. It's exploiting humans and nonhumans, destroying our planet, and contributes towards diseases/ pandemics. All these proposed solutions will take time and pure luck to implement, and "fast"... yeah right? It is impossible to keep up with the outrageous demand for animal products in the West without having to sacrifice the safety of the workers. What that man said is true, employees are literally treated like machines. That's the point, it's an assembly line to help produce a huge output as efficiently as possible. Factory farms are responding to a demand that requires these conditions to supply, plain and simple. Of course you as an individual changing your demands will not fix these problems per say, but cutting off your money to them as much as practicable and possible is the biggest personal action you can take. Don't turn this crisis into a problem some politician somewhere will figure out for us and target the reason these places even exist.
Who thought that commercial was a good idea???
Kishaniforthekulture  Kishani.biz
This is horrible. I'm glad I reduced industrial meat consumption...but  I'm not sure if it's solution to better work conditions for employees!! It's like modern slavery!
If anything was ever going to convince me to cut way down on meat, this is it. Basic human consideration.
Everyone is treated like a machine.
I could only work at the local butterball plant for 3 days, before it utterly destroyed my soul. I have never been so drained and miserable.
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)"
Thank god I became a vegetarian during the pandemic. Smartest decision I ever made, and I lost 15 pounds as well!
yet another reason to be vegan!
Government intervention and lowering profitability generally leads to moving the jobs out of the country.
Oh gee, can’t wait to see what’s trump’s fault this week.
Watching this show really is depressing sometimes and im actually from a decent country not the US, time to abolish slavery guys this time for real and yes also that prison BS going on with you.
Ahh, John. I can be certain before even two minutes in that in no way will private property and wage relations be criticized. You are are a very convenient tool.
That piss dude was not peeing out of desperation. When I need to piss uncontrollably it takes me a lot longer that three seconds to relieve myself. He was just a weirdo that sprays pee on things.
When we’ll we get this show running in 4K 60fps. Please, I need to see this adorable face in 4K.
What makes me sad and mad about our own latino and hispanic family and friends, killing themselves for these fucking corporations, but many have no choice
Hey John Oliver they took the pilgrims statue off & his house is on sale for I believe 10 millions dollars
I saw the people who work at these places when I was a trucker. They all just looked dead on the inside, and totally miserable. I think this kind of work kills your soul.
Funny how "hero" workers are being offered shots up front.
how longs it take for the short version of this. i was crying all night 💋
I already knew that Tyson is generally a bad company when it comes to workplace quality, but it sounds like it’s only the worst example of a bigger problem. Anyone know if there are meat processing companies whose employees are treated humanely?
I stopped buying pork and beef, actually for most of my life, but I do eat chicken breast.  I will be sure to boycott Tyson and Purdue from now on.
Conditions are even more grim for animals murdered in these slaughterhouses.  With the speed of slaughter... birds and pigs are boiled alive as their necks are not cut and they have not lost consciousness...
This video deserves more views 👏
The worst part is all the people watching this will still buy and consume these products.🤢
Animal Agriculture is the most disgusting thing going on this world
Just another meat hit piece
*"Thank YOU" Ronald Reagan* for telling us to "Hate Government" AND for Cutting Government -> Inspectors can inspect only "with Boxes on their Heads" -> 14:31 *"Thank you?" Donald Trump?* Will the 1st Amendment be gone soon? Can we "look forward" soon to NO Protesting and No "fake news" like this, about our food?
None of this is surprising.
Beyond burger and impossible meats all the way for me!
BREAK THE FOOD OLIGAPOLY?
None of you should be surprised by this? I have seen you all in stores when they are out of stock. Yes, the companies care amount money but it is your fault people. I have friends in working in supermarkets. Customers are assholes!! Yelling, complaining and rude constantly. You don't give two shits about the person working 18 hours and 6 days a week behind the counters. So imagine those factories that actually provide the foods. Supply and extreme disgusting demand. Don't be shocked and maybe treat those that provide your food with more respect
Welcome to the third world America!
He manages to completely ignore the fact that they are torturing and slaughtering over 10 billion animals at these facilities each year. Maybe a good sentiment would be to stop using animals for products or at least slow down?
I love you John. Please never stop being awesome ❤❤❤❤❤❤
good thing i stopped eating meat almost 2 years ago
My older brother molested me....my older sister verbally abused me by telling me, "I would never be anything to men but a scag magnet." My mother emotionally abused me and my parents would just leave us the key to the house after school. That to me is FAMILY.
"Surely this is not in our country"  Last Week Tonight With John Oliver a.k.a. This is surely in our country
That is the equivariant of if you made 50,000 dollars are year, be fining 1.5 dollars. Do you know how much change is in my house? I could easily find 1.5 dollars to make the problem go away. Hell, it could happen every week and I could afford it. I could easily budget money out to pay that kind of fine constantly. That is inconsequential.
Anyone who consumes meat is a total sick fuuuuuck. Lets be honest here. Consumers are the true cancer
there is absolutely no way that John Oliver doesn't want to see Miss Piggy's sex tape, he definitely does
No, none of this surprises me.
There’s a book called “The Jungle,” by Upton Sinclair, research the response response of President Theodore Roosevelt both of them.
Well, if they are not expected to treat the animals properly, why would we expect them to treat the humans properly either.......    start by treating the animals like animals instead of $$$ and the treatment of workers will get better as well.
Gee ...Welcome to the USA ...This goes on in most all large corporations ... The $$money$$ they spend is to bribe and BUY officials ... It has been getting worse and worse for decades ... How about a story about the bullshit "right to work" law ...
This page is underrated Prove me wrong.
Nobody should be treated like Bert Chrysler
Fuck Tyson
Brighton handbags company used the covid pandemic to fire the older employees and the ones that had high wages.
13:11 Amazon tech workers sweat nervously.
This show used to be good and funny.
Is it just me or do John's hands look like they belong to an 80-year-old?
Capitalism has failed the 99%
"We're a family"   ....... yeah the Manson family.....
In my country we have a saying. You have to make fun of your missfortune.
John didn’t bring up Adam Driver in his “things that consider me meat”. I guess that bit is dead. 😔
Thank God I don’t worry about meat. My husband & I only eat venison, turkey, boar. This spring we are adding chickens & goats to the family for eggs, milk, cheese and, well, sometimes chicken. We have an awesome well (and a wine cellar... you know. Just in case I get thirsty😁) My hubby’s garden & canning gave us so many goodies (I don’t think we will ever have to buy tomatoes again)!  We also have a vast amount of fruit trees & berry bushes. We use every part of the animal possible. We began smoking and dehydration plus we make our own burger, sausage, jerky, etc...and it’s all from our backyard. We just retired at 49 & I pray we’ll have 49 more. No, we are not “preppers”. Personally, I think we’re just smart about what’s going on in the world.  I love #JohnOliver He always says what I’m thinking.   Take care & Be safe, Everyone!
Get the IWW in there ASAP, your whole fucking country needs a new wave of unionization, YOUR WORKERS ARE DYING
👍👍👍
but i like my cheap chicken
Delete these exploitative industries --- subsidized by the government too :C #BeVegan and fight for animals and food worker's rights
Holy shit I have never seen someone look so much like a Lego figure until I saw that photo of Bo Pilgrim
NUMBER #1 ON TRENDING AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Makes me feel good about ordering all my meat from Slankers.
If you get hurt at work in a Tyson plant they will do everything in their power to prove its your fault so they don't have to pay a dime for treatment
It's demand for protein by a growing world population. Ramp up lab-generated meat, poultry, seafood. It's real animal without slaughtering, no land and water pollution. And you can have your burger the way you like it...without this assembly line misery.
Am I living the jungle 2.0?
John Oliver complains about how bad things are yet I bet he still votes for the Democrats that make it happen
Can't wait to see how the meat industry tries to backpedal THIS video
*"A Family". Considering how well, the CORPORATE STAFF get treated, I can't help but wonder, how many of them ARE RELATED to the company owner. Nepotism is a BLIGHT, and just because it's not illegal, doesn't mean it can't be made ILLEGAL, RIGHT NOW.*
how can we change this?
The USA is a 3rd world nation with a Gucci belt.   2nd biggest fakers next to North Korea.
Read Upton's Sinclair's "The Jungle". Written in 1906, it talks about a lot of the same things John Oliver has discussed today.
Boycott Tyson
Abolish the USDA
By stop eating meat we can send these companies to there grave 👍
All his house belongs to the chickens. Son of a bastard.
All of this is horrific, and yet it’s still better than Meatpacking conditions in late 19th and early 20th century.  There need to be real changes today, but the meatpacking industry has always been a bit of a septic tank.
Judging by the title, I thought this video was gonna be about those rehab programs that are ostensibly free slave labour in disguise for meat packing plants.  Wouldn’t surprise me if they’d cover those as well, though, either this season or the next. I was absolutely disgusted when I first found out about it; I knew America is completely nuts, but this was a new low point even for them.

Rich people not giving a Fuck about the people making them rich and treating them like they're disposable. Or in other words, business as usual in America
My sister in law works at one of those places. It's a cult for lack of a better term.
“And let’s start with how plants operate”  *The chloroplast is the powerhouse of the cell*
Maaaan everyday I feel like I keep getting further and further from wanting to eat any meat.
I once worked in a hospital where the president had a meeting, when we tried to unionize,  telling us that we didn't need a union because we were 'one big happy family'.  A month later, they laid off over 100 of the 'family'. But since a majority voted not to unionize, we couldn't try again for another year.
Eat less meat, folks!
You know what would fix that rabid hamster problem? A holy handgranade and a count to 3. No more, no less.
Family is not even on the list, John.
A necromancer needs to bring back Upton Sinclair it seems.
Tyson doesn't pay shit...
Please lobby to regulate this industry better. Its fckd
So glad I went vegetarian. I’m sure there are other problems with that John will make me feel horrible for too though lol
“Surely this is not our country!” Oh, poor Boomer, so blind to others’ suffering. Don’t worry! Millennials and Gen Z-ers are more than familiar enough to make up for your lack. May we be the generations of compassion and empathy! 💜
THIS IS TERRIBLE! ... Why haven't these workers been replaced by machines yet?
I like the continuity of his death to Pigeon.
way to go america....greatest country on earth
Cbxj
My ex-wife and I could tell you stories about what happens in a Cargill Meat plant in Texas. None of which are good
Kapitalism at it's finest
“The right to socially distance” is a horrific statement
JBS brazil exporting only the best kind of company.
What a disgusting country!
It’s kind of sad that some of the families that lost their loved ones may have paid more money in funeral expenses than the company paid for the $15K fine
c'mon do a segment on $GME and the stonk market.
Spell it out for the masses, John! c-a-p-i-t-a-l-i-s-m! You can do it. You're sooo close!
Have you ever been in a meat packing plant...they act like spraying bleach on a turd makes it clean.
Just another bunch of reasons to go vegan. If you give a #%# about animals this working conditions will still not change as long as meat is affortable
this is like a modern day version of The Jungle by Upton Sinclair
“We’re a family” is only true if they mean they are the kind of family were abuse rampant and there is a very strict “keep it in the family” rule in place.
if he was the first that got infected there, than it actually wasn't a work related death .. /:
The point system and exhausting hours that require overtime are some bullshit too.
In this episode, John cosplays as Upton Sinclair.
How many ppl got sick from the meat??
Society is a scam.
Wasn't their literally a book written about how awful the meat packing industry is in the twenties that ended up influencing the progressive movement like we are basically repeating our own history here
When a company says were like family.  They mean that they are that creepy uncle that's always trying to fuck you
This is just a microcosm of how fucked humanity and the planet are being raped for profits
Yet another reason why I’m proud to be vegan.  I cannot justify contributing to any of this
I have never felt like family working somewhere, EXCEPT at this little family owned restaurant in Southern Pines.  Wish I didn't have to wait several months to get a DMV appointment ( Just to find out that I'd have to make a driving and written test  appt in the city, I'm thirty, I don't need to take a driving test...) and I could be back at work. 🤷
The Owl is him watching wisely, the peacocks are managers peacocking to get his favor and the chickens are the workers, lead to slaughter.     Not that hard to decipher the painting.
this show is just sad now
It's just depressing. America eh...
I like chicken but the big 5 of chicken, like Perdue, are completely shit companies.
JO should do an episode about child marriage which shockingly prevails even in developed nations
GET'EM JOHN!!!!
Deliver the punchline! “Cool it with the meat”
"Many workers are already operating at a deep disadvantage"  Yeah, that's capitalism
Capitalism it is finest
Basically the same situation here in Germany: Foreign de facto slaveworkers from eastern Europe with no rights, working under high pressure and dangerous conditions for a few cooperations.Underfunded federal oversight. COVID infections on a regular basis. All for cheapt meat, because we, the consumers, just don't give a fuck either.
Before I even start watching this: as a vegan I'm hyped for John to spill the soy beans.
The harms done to slaughterhouse workers and the impact of animal agriculture on climate change are two of the biggest reasons why I switched to a plant based diet. Thank you for discussing this
It would be 0.0003% of net profit for 2019 (6.07 billion) and that is 204.52 billion for revenue. Not sure why this was understated.
#1 trending
The sad part is that these factories are going to turn around and just put machines on the line and lay off all those employees.  Except the out of shape office workers of course
You can make a difference! Stop buying meat and the industry will be descaled over time. These communities will stop being targeted by the meat industry and these people can get safer jobs. It has to start with the people, the gov't can't fix the consumer demand. Eat less meat ✌🌱
This is just sad! Going vegan sad!
A good chunk of the factories where I live are like this. Too the point of supervisors getting hit by the regular workers
Stop eating fucking meat!
Yes. It is gross. Even without the employees peeing under the line, the worker injuries, the implicit racism, and the covid deaths. Don't forget that Trump not only sped up meatpacking lines before covid, which increase meatpacker injuries; but after covid signed an emergency act which absolved the meat industry from lawsuites against covid deaths. You are what you eat you know.
One time my first grade teacher took away a ticket from me (little token thing) because I took a kid to the nurse when she told me to just take him inside
All office employees are obese!
''greatest country on earth'' ahahaha if this was made one any EU country the company would be fucked for life.
I mean it's dope and subscribe to mah youtube channel 🙏
First time in 4 years i havent heard him say trump
This is a beautiful retrun to form for John Oliver. This is reminiscent of the original season in which they reported mostly on relatively unknown problems that were also of great importance, and I couldn't be happier. This also shines some light on class. Which the American political dialogue has been doing an abysmal job of generating salience on.
People kept wondering how the Late Shows were going to find inspiration now that Trump is out, well they forgot how much of an horror show the fucking United States of America really is
All of the companies hire Latino immigrants mostly from Mexico. I have seen employment brochures that target Mexican immigrants. Companies like these workers because are less likely to complain or stand up.
America is a shithole country? Surprised Pickachu.
John needs to lay off the cakes
You need to do a piece on OSHA and the dog and pony shows the companies that follow OSHA’s policies put on before their arrival!!
Interesting. The meat packing industry in Germany is comparable.  1. Massive Covid cases in the plants 2. Horrible working conditions  3. Foreign workers ( mostly from poorer  EU countries like Romania or Bulgaria).  As Shakespeare would put it. “Something is rotten in the state of Denmark”
This makes me want to stop eating meat just to contribute to the dismantling of these corporations
Do people really give milk to guinea pigs?? I don't know why I think that is so weird, but I guess we feed chicken poop to cows so whatever.

I like the topics that are brought up in this show but the jokes are the worse, i wish you would just focus on the issue.
Subscribe to youtube channel 🙏
It’s crazy how people only focus on social issues when saying “We’ve become too far left” while completely ignoring things like this. This would be the logical conclusion for a hardcore conservative’s wet dream of deregulation.
一刀剁了习近平
Only the execs are family. They will do whatever to protect each other.  The workers are like the deformed child they lock up in the attic
Never seen that commercial before.  That's one of those commercials that u never forget
The seemingly never ending list of problems in our society can feel overwhelming.
Wel it's not just meat production it's all warehouses worked at harris teeter warehouse in Greensboro  and it wa bad when corona hit the worked us to death and they didnt care about corona.
Upton Sinclair wrote "The Jungle" in 1906. It seems like we're still in it.
One of the many reasons I stopped eating meat 6 years ago. Use your power as a consumer to support ethically sourced food and products.
Yes more government is always the answer 😂😂
Industrial meat production is here to stay, unless you're able to afford "humanely" raised and slaughtered animals at several times the price. So, really, it's a matter of whether or not you can afford a 50 dollar steak. Otherwise, eat whatever vegetable based protein suits your fancy -- and watch the prices of good fruits and vegetables go through the roof .... as they already are.
Dear Libertarians, Want to justify not regulating the companies in this story?
I CRY WHEN I WATCH THIS SHOW AND IM ALMOST 30 ITS TIME THIS COUNTRY WAS RESET AND MAYBE ENEV HANDED OVER TO THE ROBOTS CAUSE AT LEAST THEN THERE WOULD BE AN EXCUSE FOR THE LACK OF COMPASION
This is beyond sad.
Well.. It won't be soon now till most of them will be replaced by robotic arms and Ai
The Funny thing - in germany it is actually the same
An attorney for Mar-Jac told the inspector she would have to wear a box over her head to prevent her from seeing other hazards if she wanted to walk through the plant to examine tools in the injured worker’s locker.  The inspector refused to wear the box and wasn’t permitted to walk through the plant. The company, which had said it would cooperate with the accident investigation, later provided the tools for inspection.
Hunk of Meat Joke, But no mention of Adam Driver? I’m a little hurt from being let down so hard. Have we moved on from Adam Driver? Damn you, could we please move to Patric Stewart or Idris Elba instead? Hell Neil degrasse Tyson please?
so what you're saying is that we must [redacted] the capitalists and their accomplices before they kill us all
Wasn´t one of the last orders in office by the former guy to allow an increase in speed in those facilities? That was even more disgusting. ( I wonder who of his buddies came up with the idea)
Why would anyone bother supporting the filth that most of these so called reporters do anymore?  These people boldly said that covid was serious masks work and that the election wasn't rigged?  But hey will just forget about that stuff and move on?....hell no. People like this are dead for life for perpetuating a straight up lie. How many people have you helped kill John?  Lost their jobs families all because of people like you scare mongering the hell out of people?  You make me sick.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.
If you don't like the job, go work somewhere else. If you stay on and don't like feeling like a slave, then you're enslaving yourself.
DAD IS BACK
I feel so terrible for these workers, honestly it's obvious how corrupt these corporations are, they don't give basic benefits and even take workers comp away. The government should do something about this problem, but of course they only do things that will benefit the rich. Everyone should just stop buying these meats, let's see what they'll do then. BOYCOTT
Salad anyone?
What the hell is a blank $10,000.00 check? A blank check let's you write in the amount.
The better solution would be to place these companies under workers control, the government has been bought by the capitalist that own the plants and so any intervention by them will not interfere with profits.
Hey Americans, do you know that in civilised countries this doesn’t happen?
If I wasn't certain I wanted to stop eating meat before, I am now.
We have a betting pool on which Late Night TV host gets the CCPvirus first and how many days creepy Joe will last in office!   Advertisements are like politicians and the News, painful to listen too and never to be believed.

If only these workers had a social media platform to organize and voice the mistreatments they are victims to and weren't being silenced my big tech liberals.. hmmm no story there john...
It always makes me smile seeing that this show constantly hits the top of viewed vids on this app. Restores my faith in humanity that people are actually listening
Tyson treats employees like it treats its chickens, with the exception of outright cannibalism
America isn't a "1st world country," its a 1st world *dystopia.*
prediction: nothing will happen after this segment
More and more as we watch this show John helps us find that our world is way more like [enter dystopian world here] than we ever thought possible. How did we ever think human greed wouldn't lead us to the place we stand now, it was never Trumps supporters or the deep state,it was just us. All clamoring for the top of the pile, trying to push each other down to get there.
Fast Food Nation covered these sorts of atrocities a while back. Every owner, CEO, & board member of these industries should be thrown into a woodchipper & the companies should be arranged democratically under worker control.
*Last Week Tonight does a piece on some industry or agency in our country that is doing an awful job resulting in people being harmed or killed:  *John Oliver during the Trump administration: We need to put someone in the office that will work toward correcting these issues instead of the person there now who is doing fuck all  *John Oliver during the Biden administration: [Name of agency responsible] needs to implement standards to make sure this kind of stuff stops happening.  Is there nothing Biden can do or did the responsibilities for POTUS change when Biden replaced Trump?   For the record - I think Biden will be a better president than Trump (though I'm not a fan of Harris), but I do believe John is biased and like to point out said bias.
Automation is coming. 450,00 more unemployed.
That commercial was amazing lol
Just stop eating meat
This is part of why I’m vegan. It’s a lot about animal rights but also human rights and workers rights
That betting pool on how many employees would get COVID is absolutely disgusting, sickening, and shows a clear disregard for the health and well-being of those workers. Somehow, though, I wouldn't be surprised if there had been others like it made elsewhere in other businesses - especially among the more rich - because that fits their general attitudes to a fucking T.
Why aren't we covering Cuomo episode? I love all the perspectives that the show brought to fore during past administration, but why are we side tracking the central issue now.
Think the bigger problem is how addicted to meat Americans are.  These plants are run the way they are ran to meet the insane demand for meat products in america.
The Jungle by Upton Sinclair ANYONE? THIS FEELS JUST LIKE THE BOOK
Buy plant-based!
Stop eating meat. Remove the demand for this disgusting shit
For some reason I kept flashing back to all the times Shameless mentioned the meat packing plant and "loosing a limb."
Mr john oliver  world's biggest protest happening in india  u gonna make a video on it or kind of got scared after the last video  hunh?????????  looks like hbo money couldnt buy u enough guts.......       hehe, that was enough i thinkkk n yeahh if u r makin a vid then plzz put arnab goswami clips in too  plzzzz plzzzzzzzzz
John asks: What can we do? John answers: The Institution x has to do blabla and laws and blabla.  What about not eating the fucking meat???
Do you need more reason to #GoVegan?
10:43 This dude cannot actually look like that. He looks like a goddamn boardwalk caricature
Welcome to modern day American plantation.........
Like a modern Upton Sinclair lol
Ive seen USDA at a meat packing plant before and the only time they bothered to enforce anything was when they wanted something and the plant manager wouldnt give it to them. They miraculously found a violation that had been made 10 years prior.
Last Week Tonight should be called One More Reason to Be Vegetarian Or At Least Limit Meat in Your Diet With Angry Parrot
Just another cog in the great American Corporative Machine. When I heard about the betting pool I decided to start boycotting Tyson products. I lasted about a week, couldn't find chicken in my local stores not labeled with Tyson Foods.
jim, that child is going to be in intensive care all night while the family buries their now-rabid dog in the backyard, i dont think anybody is in the mood for frozen noodles
Another reason to say "fuck you" to the meat industry.
Corporacion greed.
It's funny how problems like this always seem to end up caused by the white haired, elderly southern man who owns the whole mess.   Ignorance, bigotry, and southern values are a poison to this country.
Meat. It's what I am to anything above me on the food chain. Like a bear, or tiger, OR ADAM DRIVER!! bite into me you medium aggressive pigeon. Carry me into your lair you hit honey badger.
Maybe you make a video about how your shows have affected the subjects that you cover. What real effect your show has on the situation in the country.
This is why unions exist. But people found it not nessesery for some reason.
go vegan
Ok, so nationalize the meat packing industry put it under public control so we there’s no incentive to awfully exploit the workers. The industry is essential to our food supply so having it be centrally planned would strongly benefit the economy and the wellbeing of our nations people
Love from Greece
Oliver is stupid! "Essential worker" status is bullshit lingo for CEO makes millions of $$, workers get paid Crap". Please risk your life for our exorbitant pay and lifestyle! Thank You, Then Management.
Fook
I used to work at Tyson in Arkansas deboning chicken breasts. I would wake up in the morning unable to move my hands and had to painfully stretch them in order regain mobility, I was 22. We had one thirty minute break for lunch. The pain was so bad most days that I literally stabbed myself in the hand more than once in order to just get a break. They truly did not care. "The nurse's office was just a room filled with bandaids and icy hot.
Years ago I read this kind of behavior is the real reason why slavery ended. It was cheaper for businesses to pay a pittance to the slaves than feed, house, and clothe them. The North had new technologies for industrialization, but the South was lagging. They fought the war, I'm glad the North won. But we still have what I'll call psedo-slavery in many work places. A lot of changes, but at the same time, the dirty side of corporate greed remains the same, only for all races now.
How can we ask for justice and at the same time not being aware of how we objectify other animals as if they were incapable of feeling???
if our society is built around profits, and we don't seem to have a problem killing trillions of innocent living beings as quickly as possible, why would we ever think they care about thousands of (replaceable) workers....
I love these pieces and find them interesting, but I'm always left wondering what can be done by those watching. Those in power don't seem to care as these issues aren't new. Those of us that do care don't have the power to change anything. So is watching this just supposed to make us upset and then we go on with our lives?
Boy oh boy i can't wait for liberal vegans to start going all holier than thou about voting with their wallets as if they can fucking do that under capitalism
The fact that this is #1 trending makes me hopeful for the future of these workers 👍
I think I have Adam Driver PTSD. Every transition that lead to a joke made me think, oh shit, here he comes! 😂
I know I'm not in any position to tell anyone what to do or what to eat, Foods these companies make cause disease and illnesses to begin with. If you simply stop buying their products you are fighting against them. Its our own doing to keep putting cancerous food into our bodies like this, and making others suffer this way.  I had a disease, called Ulcerative Colitis for 7yrs of pure hell; which is becoming a rampantly popular north-american disease. (I wonder why!) I initially lost 30lbs and weighed 105lbs from food poisoning from a chicken caesar wrap. I was extremely sick for 5 months straight. I tried suing, but lawyers wouldn't take the case. Then, I was (what I consider falsely) diagnosed with Ulcerative colitis. I had another "flare-up" 2yrs later, but this was from drinking soda with "zero sugar" sucralose as a sweetener. My doctor told me, "you can still drink this stuff" "you have colitis, so you're going to get sick anyway." That was when I could read the situation. I knew the truth that I only got sick from what I ingested.  I found a YT channel a few years ago, High Carb Health - it opened my eyes to how bad my diet was. It's interesting to see how americans are sold on eating food so bad for you, but we ignore it and keep putting band-aids on our boo-boos. (medications) "You can't knock it if you don't try it" is what I realized after watching a few High Carb Health videos.  I had a realization & stopped eating meat, drinking coffee, soda, beer and milk all in one morning of saying, "I don't want this pain anymore. I don't want to do this anymore." I started eating 2 bananas for breakfast, asparagus & mushroom salad for lunch, potatoes for dinner. In 2 weeks it felt like I was back to full health, like as if I was never sick to begin with.  In about 3 months, I was confident enough to take myself off the $1,000/mo meds my doctor put me on; That was almost 3 years ago and I'm doing far better than when I was on the UC medication. I am mostly vegan but I still have pizza (can't avoid it living in NY), and chocolate (nutella, cookies); nobody's perfect. I watch out for what I eat; even though being skinny to begin with. (average 125lbs now)  I began making observations in my everyday life. I started looking at how people are excessive consumers. When the pandemic hit, all the meat was off the shelves out of everyone's panic; but the slightly more expensive meat alternatives were fully in stock. It was hilarious to me because it was evidence of consumerism at its finest. We're all told our whole lives that meat is healthy for us, milk 'does the body good', etc. If you put a few minutes of thought into it, you'll realize you're being sold too easily. Think for yourself. It's simple to comprehend. Maybe if you were less of a consumer, you'd do better for yourself. That's how I've grown to approach almost everything lately. Eat some apples, eat a banana from time-to-time Have an orange. See how you feel.  I know I'm not going to get the best feedback for this comment if anyone reads this; I just hope this comment isn't reciprocated with any hateful response.
In our house we call the immersion blender  the vibrator of doom
Is this guy a comedian?
Slavery evolved !
Cómo podemos pedir justicia y no ser consientes de que tratamos a los animales como si fueran objetos incapaces de sentir??
The unavoidable consequences of capitalism.
I missed this show
Isn’t Judi Dench that lady who somehow is in like every James Bond movie from old to new?
Not blaming John for this one, probably his writers, but putting "phone" first in the list seems too much like a sarcastic "phone bad boomer" thing to do.
Plant Based (VEGAN) is clearly a better choice for the animal, the worker and you.
The tightfisted lycra ethically help because candle indirectly fix until a cultured slice. gifted, rabid shell
John makes more than his employees too bruh
i knew things were bad  but  HOLY SHITT
Until misery is not profitable we will all suffer.
Home of the brave
You have to keep in mind that a family is the cheapest source of human work. So he really ment "we are like family".
WOW. It has been 120 years since the release of THE JUNGLE by Upton Sinclair, and NOTHING has changed for the worker and the working conditions in meatpacking plants; Well maybe only one: children/minors are not allowed to work in ANY FACTORY [child/minor: anyone under the age of 18yo]
You know... this might be the one that makes me go vegetarian
+
Preach John Oliver, preach
These late night hosts think they are comedians
"The fine" should be jail time for assault with a deadly weapon, manslaughter, or even attempted murder charges for every executive in those companies. If your SOP leads to this sort of shit consistently, it is just corporate sanctioned crime, not a sadly overlooked flaw in the system. Unfortunate accidents will happen, but a serious accident every other day isn't an accident, it is a deliberate oversight that they aren't even trying to fix.  As far as monetary justice, whatever fines are deemed appropriate should be paid to the victims, not the government. Instead, the government should seize the company's assets and turn them over to the employees...in addition to time served for executives who implement the policies that lead to such injuries and loss of life. Life lost simply for the maximization of profits is just murder, pure and simple. If our prisons were actually filled with criminals, there would be far fewer and most of them would be wealthy, white, and completely unconvinced that what they did was wrong.
The people complaining  must love paying higher prices
Dont forget those poor amazon factory employees go through the no bathroom breaks either
So American work place safety regulations are back at the level of 1900? What a progressive country.
Sounds like "The Jungle" needs a part 2, "Pandemic Boogaloo".
Could have called the segment “The Jungle” for all those big brained high school apush students
So Tyson, do you want a Broadway musical in your name? No? Better tell your lawyers to stay put then.
Exploitation, foreign and domestic, is what built and still maintains the US economy.
Dont feed guinea pigs milk........they only eat vegetables 🤦‍♂️
This totally makes me think of Captain Awkward's "but _faaaaaamily_...." She's right that "family" is just an excuse to mistreat people.
So basically the entire meat industry is horrible. From farm to packing plant. Thanks. I hate it.
can't wait for the episode where John finally denounces capitalism once and for all.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SACRIFICE QUALITY FOR QUANTITY.
Just another reason to go vegan!!! Every time we buy animal products from these disgusting companies we allow them to keep profiting off the needless massacre of animals and the inhumane treatment of their workers.
I fucking love you man!
Fines for workers dying in a plant should be around the same as a EU GDPR fines: "$10 million, or 2% of the firm’s worldwide annual revenue from the preceding financial year, whichever amount is higher". That should incentives some people to take it seriously.
how can we continue feeding Americas but at the same time reform our meat packing practices? Remember people calling for a shutdown that there could be massive food shortages if we dont think this through and have a solid plan.
Great Video
@5:47...  have to stand in your own... somehow NOT AS ALARMING as the fact they  are PROCESSING MEAT with a FULL DIAPER!
me: horray! a new john oliver me 2 mins in "good... now im depressed"
“That is disgusting”. This has been a closer look.
I'm so proud to be a born and raised vegetarian. I'm 30 and have never eaten meat!
I am at 14:11 of this video this is not surprising we know corporations are evil especially usually always and most likely when the pale skins are in charge they make everything worse John Oliver said it himself how many people are behind the desk and how many people are cutting the chicken and having their hands crushed and being told to sign s*** with their teeth. Eat The Rich dismantle the patriarchy
So Tyson had a " dead pool".
Petition to remove the USA
Being vegan or vegetarian is not the answer.  Former underwriter for large scale food distributors and manufacturers here.  (Means I had to learn every ugly detail to offer them legal protection.) Fruit and vegetable growers have it bad too. They use migrant workers under horrific conditions. They are forced to go to the bathroom in the fields. They go for long periods without breaks and have poor living conditions. Children are still there too. When it gets processed, the workers are treated similarly to that of this meat packing olant.  This means contamination and slave like conditions for all the food you are getting. Organic used to equal small farm. No more. Have you noticed a trend of all your fresh produce coming from Mexico? Yeah, we made a trade deal to take all of their produce and give them are over processed foods. Same conditions. Same issues. We now just made it Mexico's problem too. Big corp has taken over government. We need to remove seed patents, and have government sponsor seed development, classify junk food for what it is & raise food budgets to help schools, and support other farmers beside corn and dairy producers. Why can't we help the broccoli industry? Corp greed has taken the helm of our most basic need, food.  Our power as a nation comes from an abundance of cheap food. Don't stop that. Just change it to healthy food. As it stands one virus/fungal outbreak could collapse our whole food infrastructure . If we don't do something soon we are headed towards a famine of global proportion.  Thanks for reading. I'll insert a happy face for YouTube algorithms now. 😁

That stuff about OSHA loosing their teeth makes the OSHA unit of my engineering class seem quite silly in hindsight.
As a truck driver picking up from these places and the egg farm are the worst experiences to have. First there’s the stink that’s so strong you can smell it miles away. If that’s not bad enough there’s so many flies that if you crack your window for a second swarms fly inside.The craziest thing is seeing the shift change it’s like watching a concert let out as huge droves of people scramble to their cars.
All of these conditions and suffering exist because we buy cheap meat.
Haven't watched yet. Ready for Iowa to be dragged.
Go vegan ya brave smart capable fucks <3
Major Douche' thinks he's clever and oh-so-witty. Libtard facist.
I have distressing info from a friend called Napoleon on the inside workings of the poultry industry.
6:35 "a worker .. lost a body part or was sent to the hospital .. every other day" Wow, that sounds like a really unlucky worker.
Thank you for your work!
Ja que não tem Greg News...  Cheers from Brazil
So American companies treat their workers like toilet paper?  Never heard of that.  totally new.
I find it funny how recurrent it is to hear John talk about a business model and mention that it is "controlled by these *(number that is much smaller than you expected)* companies"
Categorizing LWT episodes by their Magnus Archives fear: This one is pretty obviously the Flesh. In addition to the very on point 'meat packing' theme, the main issue is that people are only valued for their physical bodies and treated as disposable if those bodies cannot work well enough. The owl adds a little hint of the Eye, which is as it should be.
is it me or does the meat packing plants look like something out of Breaking Bad? Very Meth lab-ish in presentation....just that the meat folks have more folks packed in
Welcome to the jungle* Upton Sinclair
Like many family secrets, they get swept under the rug to keep the family intact.  Also a good read for the effects of Slaughterhouse work on employees.  Slaughterhouse:  The Shocking story of Greed by Gail Eisnitz.   Many immigrants do these jobs, and it affects their psyches in horrible ways, the ones that work in the plants and/ or on the kill floors.
If they take away meat that's it, I'm going ham.
When I used to work at FedEx as a package handler, the items would come down the line so fast that it was extremely hard to be able to take a restroom break because of the way our work space was organized. If you're the first in your line grabbing items for the first three trucks, all your items would fall into the hands of the next 6 trucks/the other 2 package handlers in your line. The turnover  rate was very high which meant we were often understaffed and sometimes had two handlers split 9 trucks. Sure you could ask your manager if they could cover for you, but not only do they have other things to do but you can't ask every time you need to take a quick wiz. I always went to the restroom before going to work and would only take breaks if I really had to go and I'm happy to say I never wore a diaper. So glad I only worked there for a little bit over a year.
WOOO FUNNY BRITTISH MAN IS BACK!
Animal Agriculture is inherently disgusting & evil. This is no surprise unfortunately.
At this point, can USA still claim to hate communism when they have gulags? Between the US army that sends people to jump on improvised explosive devices on roads to working conditions in warehouses and slaughterhouses, just call it as it is, the USA isn't a freedom-loving democracy, it's an aristocracy with more lawyers than common sense and a loud PR campaign.
I thought John said Haole workers not hourly hahaha
Impossible 🍔
I wonder if the meat industry is going to try to destroy John Oliver after this
You call your employees your family so that they feel responsible to their job beyond the paycheck that they receive, in addition to the undervaluing that John mentioned.  Same reason why we call people "heroes".  Businesses love heroes, because they aren't paid for the services they provide to the community.
Now you have a problem with meat packing? That's a really hard job that feeds the country. Dude you have a kid, shouldn't value your family more? 3:11 that's not acknowledging the sense of humor people would have whom work in meat packing. One would assume they would have a dark sense of humor 4:39 you don't cook do you? 6:26 I thought the footage looked old. Dude c'mon recent footage is a must.  Do you any idea how much meat packers make? 6:38 no shit that like saying people that work on wind turbines tend to fall. 7:59 are you stupid? The plants are in rural areas because the animals are there. Immigrants work there because we like cheap meat and most Americans are spoiled to the point you could use this video for outrage rather than humble them 8:18 liberal elitist want us to report things to osha  F**k you 12:14 seems like private insurance would be great here 13:46 racist, you said the plants were in low income areas wouldn't it be reasonable to assume the corporate offices aren't? 13:57 no no I wouldn't. The last thing I would want is that.  14:06 you can tell he's never worked hard his whole life. Seriously who likes osha? 14:12 I would like to double that time 15:47 if you close the plants where would the food come from? We can't eat good vibes 17:33 no no no no. Stop it 17:39 no no no it doesn't 17:45 why are trying to raise the price of meat? 17:59 no no its not you just keep saying it is Liberal elitist john Oliver do you not like poor people eating meat?
Beyond meat
In house meat packing nurses remind me of Sick Call, hahahahahaha.
Why aren’t workers in a union? And why hasn’t there been talks of unionizing workers?
Hmmmmmmmm I do not love my phone more than my dog. I mean wife. I don’t love my phone more than my wife. *Nailed it*
An episode on Amazon workers unionizing please
Welp  I've lost my appetite
More government John? What is wrong with you, go back to UK if you want that bro! We need privet company to take care of shit like that, then abolished, that way no power gets to grow.
Stop eating factory farm meat. Support your local farmers.
Just realized something. On this channel I’ve heard of problems that don’t exist in Europe. If a problem exists in Europe its a LOT worse in the USA. Still love how you Americans believe you are a first world country...
Make sure you wash your chickens and cook them thoroughly--chicken processed by sick workers, injured bleeding workers, workers loosing body parts???, workers urinating on themselves,  with no time to think or go to the bathroom, no leverage to call in sick or receive decent medical coverage, or workers with Bengay rubbed all over them? --or better yet  one more good reason, just don't eat meat.
I've quit many jobs because I was annoyed by much smaller issues. I'm not sure I feel sorry for anyone who stays in an environment they feel has horrible conditions.
lord I hate this country even more every day I exist
Why would over 1k give a thumbs down to human conveyor belts? Smh...
Here for the comments and not surprised😂I’m surprised it’s somehow #1 on trending
So, basically the greatest country in the world in a nutshell once again....
UNIONIZE YOUR WORKPLACE!
Does anybody have any tips on growing subscribers. I'm trying to hit 100 so I can have my own link.
When I worked construction, we had to do so many things because of OSHA. I don't understand why the restrictions are different. Oh wait, when's the last time you heard of construction lobbying?
That video of the corporate workers getting random fitness breaks really gave me "sorry to bother you" vibes
I'm glad more Americans are finally starting to see that their country only functions because of intentional dysfunction.
Didnt TR, the USDA and the progressive era handle this? Oh wait conservatives want to undo everything
Unions, Unions, Unions... unions with actual pull
$$Blue buy now 🍢 I heard there was something about blue and innuendo on elon's Twitter
Yeah this country is fucked up but it’s the least shity honestly
Of course iowa would be on this episode
Asif you needed yet another reason to not eat meat. The list is infinite already. Take a stand people. The meat industry is thoroughly imoral on every single level imaginable
Tell me you live in America without telling me you live in America
If your boss bet you would get sick you deserve to be punched
Go vegan
Texas literally does not give a fuck about human life.
If you don't want to be grilled, you probably have worms at the end of your food chain ...
The meat industry is just overall horrible. Ethically and for the environment. There are so many great alternative food options out there if you just spend a little time breaking your habits. It's truely amazing!
The beginning of this video made me laugh so hard 😂
#@
If Tyson's CEO says his employees are his "family" and then turns around and treats them like that, then I think someone should do a check on his _actual_ family, because with that in mind I'm compelled to guarantee he's abusive towards them as well :\
that ad at the beginning literally looked like a parody of what a perdue ad should look like
If only our congress wasn’t neutered and could pass broad regulations that would protect the labor force
OSHA has put me into very dangerous situations because nobody that works for me has a license to operate a new model of towmotor. We all know how to operate a tow motor but apparently this new one needs a different license(pay money for the new thing). Many times I have had to carry 200 plus pound things up many flights of stairs because it is safer than using a tow motor. Thanks OSHA for getting my back, I mean wrecking my back!
This isn't in all factories. This is a biased information of some factories.
#john oliver #bnb #btc #pancakeswap
Let's all go vegan and cut the crap =)  for the animals, for humanity, for the planet...LEGGO!!!
Glad I’m vegan!
As a vegetarian, i feel like im ready for whatever this video can throw at me. Lets go johnny, lets dance
that's why it needs both systems to keeo each other in check - not everything about capitalism is bad and not every attempt of creating a society only based and socialism is really that good - do you need capital to build a society, yes but you also need a society which sees itself as a solidarity community to keep everything on a humantitarian level  and that is also the reason why tax evasion should be punished harder + the money should not only be paid, but with interest - every tax evasion, especially the big ones, is a crime against society, because that is the money the system is lacking - hospitals, schools, prisons etc. - that is the reason why everything gets privatized and why the prices (& taxes) are rising
I worked at chicken processing center in Fresno it was rough
This is appalling and disgusting. What can we do about it? Become vegan; spend 2 or 3 times more for organic free range meat; organize a worker strike? I seriously want to know. It makes me feel sick to know this is happening to people.
And people still want to say we’re the greatest country. We’re nothing but sheep to the 10%, and half the country will willingly blindly follow.

That lady and guy complaining both seemed illegal so I mean, maybe that's why they were refused medical treatment and told they'd be fired. Just a thought since the girl couldn't even speak English
2:45 Holy crap! That is the actual “dead pool” betting game straight out of marvel, that resulted in a certain talkative Mexican-food-loving fan favorite. Sickening.
13 min in and already 3 lies that are easily looked up and fact checked by anyone who is not a moron of course, but it might be that that's the target audience. MSM at work
Glad to see John Oliver is back.
I can't wait for John to talk about Biden.
Fast Food Nation from 2006 covered this in a dramatic form. Basically nothing has improved in 14 years.
Go vegan!
John.. get me a job at osha, I wanna do my part xoxo
If an employer says they consider their workers family that's a red flag. It is always a sign that they are going to treat you like crap
SD
Relentless pace meatpacking-relentless pace talking about it-SLOW DOWN !
At this point I'm surprised they haven't started giving their employees amphetamine tablets or something at the start of their shifts to boost productivity.
Maybe stop supporting these companies.
Recently various of my coworkers have sued our job and a couple have already won over working conditions. And its nowhere near this. It's unimaginable that these workers don't get million dollar settlements
The easiest way to help with this is to go vegan. Combat climate change, animal cruelty, and live longer.
This shows industry’s modern form of slavery & abuse.  Hopefully the right people in our new more human Federal government will see this video.  OSHA 30 general industrial safety should have included examples like the ones John Oliver shows in this video.
I'm buying not buying meat  until this shit is fixed. There are so many good meat alternatives now anyway.
DO THE INSURRECTION STORY
Shipyards are very similar if not worse, just something else for you guys to know about
you know what puts a stop to stuff like this? *Strong unions* put a stop to stuff like this.
What happened to your jokes?
Expecting a company that kills things for profit to give a shit about anything but profit through killing things is ludicrous at best.
Go back to Britian, you have no idea what it's like being a middle class American
Wtf
I worked for Sanderson farms at when I was 22 they offered me $15 a hr to cut 34 chickens a min the pain in your hands, arms and dealing with the cold, wet conditions is real but at $15 a hr for ex-cons, immigrants, and ppl without a higher education & children you suck it up.   (They still play anti-union videos during the hiring process) when the CEO would visit they would make it seem like they gave us breaks regularly. After I quit it took 5 months for my hands to stop twitching & open/close correctly.
The left: pushes for as much immigration as possible  Also the left: why are the majority of the factory workers who work in appaling conditions minorities
99% of people commenting are supporting the meat packing industry
Murica is so f**ked up. You should really start to make it great, at least for once.
Meditation in a cooperate office of coarse... a joke. Yet the productions workers can’t even break a bathroom break
I hope one of the episodes cover Indian Farmer's Protest. Come on John you can do it ....
Yea FDA doesn't do anything anymore, useless government agency.
Meanwhile here in Danbury CT.  we still feed our John by taking an Oliver.  All of us who work at the John Oliver Memorial Sewer Plant consider ourselves family.  Maybe you should come by and visit your namesake John....    I'm sure your agent can arrange a photo op with you John and the Oliver holding tanks.
JBS does not bring 50billion a year, this is their revenue. Their net income is 130million.
My mind drifted to the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch
How do we stop them? How do we stop all big companies from being shitty?
What would the response be if these were natural born white Americans being injured?
this video has shown me my purpose to cyber bully Tyson chicken
Where's the Texas piece of this episode that aired on HBO MAX???
Yeah, I remember my last family reunion, where we all bet on when grandpa was gonna kick the bucket.
Republicans watching this thinking, "this is how all jobs in america need to be!"
This is what precious republican deregulation looks like.
Daily reminder to go vegan if you don't want to support the animal agriculture industry
Cut back on meat consumption. Plan one whole  meatless day.
i want Salary but i don't want to work... Cuz... Virus.    ~ idiots  Good Morning Sunshine that's not how it works. And if you would've taken Some Basic Precautions you wouldn't Get Virus.   Company didn't infect you just to see how Million dollar Loss looks like.
Not THAT kind of meatpacking
Are any companies better with meat packing? For example, is organic meat also handled differently? It'd be helpful to know as the consumer so we can support the companies that do things better.
He didn't even begin to touch on the working conditions and environmental nightmares of the factory farms that raise the animals that go to these plants!
Sweet Odin, god of war. The end is near. These jack-tard companies are like whited sepulchers. Clean from the outside, but within, full of rotting bones and corruption. I think I'll bypass Tyson meat.
i just want humans to go extinct already we’re so awful
So much for the great American dream! 🙄
NO MEAT - NO COVID! Respect animals and humans, stop being a hypocrite, align your values with your behaviour, GO VEGAN!
But Tyson has a monetary insintive to offer its corporate office workers physical health classes to lower their health insurance rates 🙄  Remember if your not paying for it, YOU are the product
The fuzzy  carriage noteworthily shrug because swim transmurally lick including a eight ease. imaginary, shocking low
So many people think that it’s all over the world,but if John olive say what’s happening in Africa???
What the hell was that commercial?! 😆
I worked at Seaboard Foods for 9 years, in that time I learn all areas possible. I saw 1 guy commit suicide with the captive bolt gun used to kill pigs unable to walk, within 2 hours the company just disinfected the blood spilled on the floor and resume normal work. I hurt my back lifting the ramp cleaning the hauling trailers, the manager guy told me it was nothing and resume working, note that I couldnt squat and 11 years later I still have the same issue and struggle to bend down to pick a simple gallon of milk. The pay and benefits are great for us people without expensive diplomas though.
Jim Purdue is a Python fan, but he used an easily misinterpreted part of The Holy Grail to sell stuff. I have to admit, I'm a little conflicted.  No, wait, this is the guy who exposed his workers to COVID and tried to get the government to pass laws that waive him of liability. Fuck him.
Do you still eat meat, John?
In USA comedian spread more facts and news then Indian news TV anchor (aka journalist)😂.
Without John, we would never really know what is going on in Amerika.  If only the current news media would look to see how news should be reported.
I worked in a factory (not meat) and hurt my back on the job doing my job the way they told me to do it. CAlled the rotation leader and he said “.... come to my office” which was up 2 flights of stairs. I hobbled to the stairs, and pulled myself up the stairs, crying, wheezing, literally had a slipped disc and sciatic pain down my leg. Get to his office and he says “yeah you aren’t lying? Go home”. Which of course I got a “hit” for the missing time, and I went to the doctor on my own and the company said “we did not authorize that and it wasn’t a workplace injury”
*uck Bill gates!
AMERICA - land of the constant delusions about pulling up bootstraps, blaming people for being poor... all the while keeping people poor, uneducated and powerless is a business model not a random fluke.
it looks like the early days of the industrial revolution, :v... mmm I think this could be automated with recent ML methods
Companies are people who can commit horrifying acts of violence against their employees and communities and remain free from prison for generations.
Been done before, Upton Sinclair anyone?
Every single person who eats meat shares responsibility for this. Another great reason to go vegan today! #govegan 🌱
But we want cheap chicken on our table everyday. And I love nuggets. It really sucks knowing the ripple effect your actions have. The namasté bit was brilliant. Love John Oliver and I get concerned everytime he loses it, especially in this white void he is trapped now.
Congrats on #1 on trending
STOP EATING MEAT
The high-pitched japan conceivably guide because afghanistan frustratingly hop against a various airplane. unruly, godly orchestra
Hey John next time you talk about "factory farming" and the conditions on a farm talk to a farmer. When you say things like that it insults farmers and the care they try to have for animals.
A view point I have pondered for years is that comedy news like this (daily show late night talk show hosts) are more new worthy/investigative journalistic than the big 4.  Its depressing that modern news is a business that sells itself then drawing a crowd based on quality information
I’m glad you’re bringing awareness to the joke that our government’s safety regulations have been for the past three decades. When last years OSHA fines were made public I looked through them and I believe I found this plant. If I’m remembering correctly 4 people died 80+ were hospitalized and 4,000+ had tested positive.
Thanks again John. Well researched and well presented.
Yikes
Use great caution when googling 'Meatpacking' in a public setting.
Pasta Bolognesa á lá Guinea Pig!  tasty little guy
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
Truly, appreciate you bringing light to this, esp how often people, including those that would consider themselves "woke", care more about animals in these factories than people. My whole community and most of my family worked in a slaughter house. I've seen a man's finger cut and swallow to the point it looked like a hot dog burst from over cooking, a friend eat with all his protective gear on eat with cow shit on face and blood stained hands bc we only got a 30 min break and it takes that long just to take our gear off, and so much more. Days I didn't see the sun cause we got in at 5 and left at night. Fuck this industry. Someone needs to write a new version of The Jungle, cause that is what it is in that  bitch - a fucking jungle.
😳😳😳wow
Someone find me a link to that commercial
And this is just one of the long list of reasons I don’t eat meat
There you have it. Tax profit waaay more, improve safety standards and increase fines for violations. Make it unappealing for business to exploit workers.
Worked at Pilgrims, had a bathroom accident on the line because having diarrhea isn't enough to get you sent home without getting a "point". BTW. JBS now own pilgrims, and they allow you 6 points. If you are two minutes late, you get a half a point. If you are sick for 2 days but don't go to the Dr, that's 2 points, if you throw up where the nurse doesn't see you and leave, that's a point. Got fired because I was close to having a stroke, but no nurse was available to see me.. went straight to ER and took them note, still fired for "walking off the line". I got my job back a few years later, got pregnant and was 8 months when the day care for my older daughter closed due to COVID. The day care opened in July but couldn't take infants due to covid restrictions. I lost my job because the day care had opened and it wasn't their problem that I couldn't send my daughter. On top of all of that, the day shift supervisor (who is above all other supervisors) had been using his authority to have me send pictures of myself to him with promises of career advancement, points taken off, etc. He has been fired after multiple complaints to local HR and then a threat to HR in Greeley, CO to sue.
Oliver trending at number one WOOOOO!  and we all know he don't give a fistful of f@cks
Cheap meat isn't cheap. The actual price is just being paid by someone else.
After surviving the Holocaust and fighting in 6 wars in Israel my grandfather came to America and worked in meat packing for decades. He sliced his finger off at work and had to go to work the next day for fear that he would be fired. He later died of leukemia that my family believes was due to being exposed to the chemicals in the plant for all those years. It breaks my heart that conditions have not improved at all and people are still dying from these greedy companies not giving a fuck about their workers. More light needs to be shed on these shady corporations.
Every Perdue family is evil.
Happens with Amazon pickers and it's not surprising it happens with meatpackers.
Abusing humans to kill other sentient beings, but you're right, veganism is the radical idea
after watching this, 'tönnjes' actually does not seem that bad; well done, murica...
America is built on exploiting others, so what are you complaining about?
Its "The Jungle" up in this bitch.
By purchasing products from these compaines you are directly responsible for supporting these practices. Vote with your dollar!
When are we going to wake up?
Dammit America. Get your shit together.
JBS is involved with sever corruption scandals here in Brazil
https://youtu.be/bqN0c55A9_U
yeah, your workers are your most valuable asset. But they aren't "family" Only cult leaders say that kind of stuff to their subordinates
if only Upton Sinclair had warned us....
Zimmerman is a hero.
when is first watched this it was #1 on trending
Any one calling themselves your family not related to you reeks if organized crime.
Humans are NOT carnivores. Quit eating so many dead animals, folks! Beans are far healthier and will never lead to diabetes or heart disease.
"The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair. 100 years later...Same Practices..Same Companies!!
In the race to the bottom, America is number 1.
Eat the rich.
That is disgusting! Greetings from Munich, Tom.
sounds like family to me...my uncle gave my grandmother MERS back in 2013.
If the workers are treated this bad, think about how the animals are treated.
You always make me depressed John... It's just the nature of your work
I honestly wonder how many "Enemies Lists" John Oliver" is on? Good job... keep being great!
Judy dench? Maybe over where you come from Oliver!!! Betty White is our national treasure...
Like "The Jungle" all over again...except it never left. Stop eating meat.
I must state for the record that I feel for the fools that work at meatpacking plants, but the real tradgedy is the pain and torture that the animals go through. Yes, Jon, you SHOULD do a segment on that. #govegetarian #fakemeatisustastasty
Funny as hell.  The meat packing plants are corrupt as hell and don't give a damn about their employees.
People think voting will change this. These companies ARE our government. We have to do a lot more than vote.
I like there is no laugh track.
Gotta admit, Upton Sinclair and Theodore Roosevelt are yelling and banging on their coffins.
The Jungle never left it was just pushed behind closed doors, watch Dominion and go vegan.
Number one trending. People been missing John Oliver I see haha
This is like a modern day The Jungle by Upton Sinclair, except without three hours of socialist theory slapped on the end
https://youtu.be/L-lLmqQNX6o😎
This definitely doesnt sound like my assembly job at an auto manufacturer. No not at all.
Wait wait. Pause for a moment. Let me take a big bite out of this juicy meat ball. Mmm nice! Okay now tell me why I am a monster john. Im ready!
The US are a very wierd country...
Oliver is extremely annoying
George Zimmerman's auction of a murder weapon will forever go down in history as one of the most grotesque, heartless, and appalling endeavors ever.
I'd honestly like to see John Oliver cover working class employees of corporationd in general. Like, Starbucks employees, Chick-fil-A, and Chipotle. Places that are large companies but not franchise (i.e. you can't own a franchise of them). They still put up with a lot.
john oliver back on trending where the views deserve. last season it rarely ended up on trending. glad youtube is done repressing it
This is the result of a country founded by slave drivers, and still dealing with the parasitic ideas still around. corporations getting treated like humans. Finance laws demanding corporations be treated like a person, AND make more more than the year before, or get fined...  lack of universal Healthcare and UBi...nobody would put up w this if UBi, and healthcare was a thing
LETS GO VEGAN!
When I was a kid, I worked at the "Live" department at Country Pride Chicken in Geirgia. Check that one out if you want to see blood and feces all over people. In we wore dust masks, goggles, a smock, demum sleeves, boots thick gloves, etc because we were covered in it and breathing it in all fucking day. I don't know if any of this has changed since 1980. You would have to investigate.
Unionize everything.
I know a lot of vegans are thinking see that’s why we gotta get rid of the meat industry guess what it still won’t solve the problem you still have to improve the conditions at factories if you just replaced the meat industry with vegan meat industry the bad conditions are still there we are not harming animals anymore but we are still exploiting the humans
No one ever wants to know how the sausage is made.
Holy fuck. Holy fuck I missed you so much you legitimately do not understand.
So many Americans have no idea how much their whole comfy American lifestyle depend on near slave labor of mistreated, desperate masses of people. They watch Bangladeshi sweatshops on tv and nod with sadness, ‘those third world countries...’ and it’s THE SAME THING that’s in their backyard. Wake tf up
If your phone is #1. You have a problem!!
I used to work at a chicken factory in Chattanooga Tennessee it was the most miserable and uncomfortable job. The constant sounds of the machines, poor lighting, blood and feces all over the place. The smell and inhumane way treating the chickens. Some chickens would come in dead from the delivery trucks and they would still be processed. They weren’t even able to stand on their own 2 feet because of the Weight of their body on their undeveloped bones. They were force-fed or fed too much.

Comedy for people with no balls or family
good work Last week tonight team 👍🏻 i would have loved to watch the show until the end but couldn't anymore after 7 minutes...this is a too horrible reality for me.
Can't help but feel that capitalism has pretty much destroyed any meaningful advancements for the average human. Companies exist solely for profit -> Companies have become more powerful than governments (at least in the US) -> people exist solely for companies to generate profit What's the point of even being alive these days?  [My alternate comment was 'The Jungle 2: Meatpacking Boogaloo" but thanks to certain white supremacists 'boogaloo' is no longer the fun, baggage-free word it once was]
In that dude's defence, his own piss is hardly the worst thing on that floor.
going postal works to get the attention of ceos and shit
And all this horror starts with the legal bribery of elected officials, in the form of unlimited "campaign contributions", and that's also why legislation will never change on this issue.
John Oliver is the only late night show host that's not super awkward during lockdown
I worked in manufacturing for 15 years, the treatment in the video is pretty much the same across the board. There was always a huge disparity in treatment, expectation, and pay between line workers and office workers. I was blown away when I moved from the floor to the office (due to my degree and experience, not because of an upward mobility option) to see the difference. Even the most basic things like showing up on time was handled laxly for office workers and punished severely for line workers. The fundamental issue I saw was that line workers were viewed as an unskilled dime a dozen expendable asset where as office workers where viewed as long term investment; even though at the bottom, both were entry level and just as replaceable. I ended up being able to leave for a better career in education, but many don't have that ability and due to their backgrounds; many take the horrible treatment and say "at least I have a job".
"It has just stopped me cold from eating another burger." - Oprah 1996
Oh boy, and just wait until we talk about their environmental impact!
Literally it's f****** disgusting I just filled the girls that are talking about it at 5:55 or just melting in my head because they don't want to deal or even think about that s***...
Seeing John trending as #1 makes me happy
I honestly have to say that I like John's jokes way more now that he's not playing to a live audience
Why didn't he say that Adam Driver is above him in the food chain? Doesn't he want to be eaten by Adam Driver?
Horrible way to live your life..
Tyson Foods: "Our meat has the flu"
I say give the companies to the workers in the factory and have them unionize.
"Any animal above me"--- i really wanted you to say Adam Driver
If you needed any more reasons to go vegetarian or vegan, here you go.
The main problem in this country isn't that these rich jerks continually exploit people. It's that those being exploited want more than anything to become those rich jerks.
5:08 good give him credit tho, he made sure the gloves didn't get contaminated.
It is, it really is.
"The free market will balance itself", they said. "Regulation is bad" they keep saying. "Supply and demand will make sure prices and wages are fair" is a lie at least no-one seems to repeat anymore nowadays, then again i'm in europe and haven't talked to an american lately.
gods i h8speech this guy, he used to be a comedian, sellout
It's funny the face that that woman made at 518 because yeah it's obviously disgusting imagine being an anchor and not being able to take a break until the hour is up. So I feel like it's not his fault because they were blocking him from actually taking a piss and from making him look bad so in the end it makes the f****** company look bad
Well fuck me, we had the exact same shit in German meatpacking plants
☘ Irish Honey Badger - #Priceless 😅
Pets needed to come before family. 😊
HE HAS RETURNED
Every time I hear a corporate boss refer to their employees as family I get 5 steps closer to the fucking edge.
Meat Plants use 175k  immigrants & OPPRESS them. Fake nurse on site.
I'm just so tired of shitty corporations and right-wing nutjobs.
How many more reasons americans need to stop over-consumption from industries, let alone going veg? My god, the PTSD of all the horrible things we humans do to ourselves and our planet will last generations...
Anyone with friends or family in these plants knows people that got sick with COVID from work...
Global warming, cancer, animal agriculture, abused workers... as if we didn’t have enough reasons to eat plant-based/vegan.
"Giving a fraction of a f**k" -- that's my new standard for ignorance and denial. Thank you, John Oliver, for yet another brillant episode!
The unadulterated exploitation of vulnerable groups isn't surprising,  it's capitalism.   GUARANTEED if all these plants were staffed by only those that CRY about illegal immigrants.  1) worker conditions would change instantly! 2) wages would increase 3) health benefits would improve.
Glad I'm vegan.
they should do a show where they talk about something nice America has done, like saving the world in WW2 or the Marshall Plan but I guess those things were too long ago
WTF was that ad?
Long life to those slavery corporations 😔😱
Just a quick question, who would dislike this video? Please comment and explain to me. Don't you want companies to be held accountable?
My ex employer told me I didn’t need a respirator to cut and grind fiberglass😂
If only we had a president who'd campaigned in meatpacking plants in Iowa last year....
Shame on him for not mentioning unions and collective bargaining as one of the remedies
What's new?  It has always been this way in developing countries like Bangladesh, India, Cambodia, Indonesia... You know, countries many people look down on as poor, underdeveloped or just "shitholes" (Trump) in general.  Wait a second... Is this the USA?!  Oh yeah, but we don't call them a shithole just yet.  They have a few good years of unbridled capitalism left in them...  "You can judge a society by the way they treat their weakest." - Gustav Heinemann  (freely translated)
They definitely need to unionize too
We need to move away from all animal products and eat mostly plants.
Well, when people wont pay the Price of chicken, made in a safe way. This is What happens
First job was on a produce production line, can confirm, difficult to take bathroom breaks. Edit: lmao can confirm the neighbor's knife danger as well
Lol they forced us to sign those even for tiny cuts 🤣🙄
the early 1900s really keeps repeating these last couple years
Listening to stories like this and knowing that history is a giant cycle that repeats itself I sometimes wonder how much time we got until riots of the working class break out all around the world like in England in the 19 th century. And being a member of the working class I can hardly wait. Sad reality we're living in people, but stay strong. All the best to every one of you !
9:05 A good reason to fire someone: telling an employee not to see a doctor, when the need arises, same with basic breaks. A management that acts illegally, unmorally and against the good reputation of it's company, should be changed.
Who won the bet though
Every job I've ever had, osha was a bad word. They give a heads up of when they're coming and we'd just make sure everything was up to code that day, with the understanding that, if we didn't, people would definitely be fired after osha left.
Ehh, family is a massive asset for the oligarchy members.  Anybody think Trump would have amounted to ANYTHING but for his daddy?  The same goes for many, many of  "the elite" - people wo neither have the will nor the capacity to manage anything, but do so nonetheless because of parents, siblings, in-laws....
Might duck around and go vegetarian
The fact that these conditions exist, confirm to me that most of the usa is at the very least, not angry enough about it.
They want to make meat expensive. So we go vegetarian.
hey five year me
There really are limtiless reasons to not eat meat, especially in the US. Animal cruelty, unsanitary conditions of animals, health hazards and horrid working conditions for workers all the way through the supply chain, terrible environmental impact, and it's bad for your health as well.
What happens when your politicians are on the take, and corporations run the country.
Not to play into spot the vegetarian but like not eating meat is a means of protesting this.
Go vegan for all. Not just the animals, but for the poor humans working in these shithole conditions as well.
So whatever happened to Unions? Oh wait...workers should only have the right to work if they're our slave. And even then...?
It's the Guinea Pig of Caerbannog!  Run!!!!!!
Funny when some bad companies use the word family like a key to open all the doors just remember this it’s always the slimy boss that fuck everything up just to get the big bucks🤦🏻‍♂️Damn shame
Vegetarian gang
We NEED a conspiracy/propaganda episode!
sounds like its union time.
Upton Sinclair has entered the chat
Don't eat Tyson. No problem.
Just one more reason (not that I needed one) I’m a vegan!🌱
OMG!! Never eating meat again! ... actually I decided this 5 years ago ;) this was one of the reasons, so inhumane
@ غ
Any boss telling me I’m family  Me: aight ima head out
is it me or does John look zooted in this one
This why we need to change how we look things in the USA or even the world. Like Rich people are always evil even if you do good, and if you have a company they need to be checked randomly if the workers in a safe in a working place.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5xG5E2j1NA&t=3s
They should automate the process and fire all of the workers then. That will fix the bathroom breaks and carpotunnel issues.
Simple, stop eating meat, these companies don't deserve your money
What, wasn't meat packing fixed by Upton Sinclair's The Jungle almost 100 years ago?
Fucking UGH! Like being American needed to feel worse...
I worked 4 years for a union shop in meatpacking about 20 years ago and it was still awful. I had tendonitis from my hands to shoulders when I quit because I was too young to be crippled for life. I still have plantar fasciitis, heel spurs and trigger fingers. I also had skin conditions while working due to exposure to  blood. I'm not surprised it's still awful in 2021
If any business calls it's employies familie, get the fuck out. That a cult with not enough members!!!!
this guy makes swearing sound lame
That owl kinda kinky ngl
This week in "I'm Glad I Don't Have To Live In America"... 😨😱
Thnak you for doing meatpacking. I have been bitching about this for years. We totally warned everyone a thousand times.
Where I'm from in NE Kansas, we have at least... 5 or 6 plants/warehouses to get a job at. All in probably a 100 mile area. I worked at a Smithfield plant in my hometown. It's got good benefits, the least terrible of the terrible shift based hours, and kind of good pay. I worked overnight from 6pm-6am. The working conditions were safe, but that's also only because we were a packaging and processing plant. We weren't a slaughtering facility. I was getting early signs of carpel tunnel a week into working there, they did have free physical therapy sessions for people suffering from work related pain though. It's no joke and like I know for some communities, like mine, if you aren't in the military or have a college degree, this is the only job opportunity that they have to support their family.
America, land of the free, home of the brave, this shit is illegal in Europe...
Compost the rich.
Meatpacking: what John wishes Adam Driver would do to him
13:45 I can understand being outraged over pay discrepancies between ethnicities, but outrage over half of the workforce being white is misleading.  You don't walk into an Asian-majority country and be shocked that the majority of a factory's workers are Asian.  You shouldn't be shocked when a white majority comprises the workforce of a factory in a white majority country.  If  the ethnic pie chart of the factory doesn't resemble its city's pie chart, _then_ there is a problem.  Quit cherrypicking your data.
Capitalism is broken. Join your local chapter of the Democratic socialists of America and get involved. The only way out of this crap is together.
Lets not forget Tyson plays the 5 second rule with chicken on the floor.
ayyy, im in a small village in France and get my meat from the boucherie who gets their meat locally. Its much better than when I lived in the states
Is anyone shocked this happened in red Texas? The fines should be based on a percentage of income so they actually encourage them to value the people working for them.
Reason no.2 why I don't eat meat in the USA.
I never thought I'd see JBS on John Oliver. They're a brazilian company that were involved in a huge meat scandal in Brazil, and even though I knew they were big, I didn't know they were THAT big to the point of being important in the USA meat market.  We brazilians know JBS from their famous scandal where it was discovered they were mixing expired meat with cardboard, grinding it and selling as if nothing was wrong.  They (and a couple others meatpacking companies) bribed quite a few health inspectors for that to work.  It was quite a big work for the Brazilian Federal Police, lots of people arrested, lots of memes made (brazilians make memes instead of crying, if we didn't we would all be depressed).  Anyways, I'm not surprised they are violating safety and heath standards again, I'm just surprised they're doing it so openly in the USA and nothing is being done.
John "upton sinclair" oliver.

Man, Upton Sinclair needs to write another book
5:59 everytime I hear, how the USofA are the greatest country of the world, I simply cannot do anything but laugh. Stories like this, needing 3 jobs to survive, health insurance. The list is neverending. If you are not rich, there are appr 30-40 countires that are better than the USofA in almost every regard.
Until the customers demand more from these companies and politicians stop taking under the table deals to protect them legally this will continue on for as long as we consume their products. Blind eye and deaf ear. 🙈🙉
I'm happy to be a vegetarian.
A 10,000 dollar check can, by definition, not be blank.
Sinclair Lewis' The Jungle for modern times.  Well done, John Oliver.
OH PUH-LEEZE!!  'FAMILY'???? miserable working conditions for most often immigrant employees--health stress, amputations, disease ...horrid.
I’m pretty sure placing bets on how many of your workers are gonna die is something Nef Anyo and the Corpus did in Warframe.
They will be forming unions soon.
Why is America such a shit hole of misery?
Just another example of Money Talks and Bullshit Walks. These companies are 3/4 bullshit anyways. We shouldn’t be surprised.
Fucking finally he’s back
Great, corporations are changing public policy to better benefit themselves. What could go wrong?
You got me, John! What can I do to help?!
Wonder when people in the US start finally unionizing and demand some rights and proper salary.
Just to be clear, I'm not advocating violence here!  That being said, you really couldn't blame a person diagnosed with terminal cancer for making a list of the 10 richest people in their state & then spending an afternoon putting a bullet in the heads of as many of them as possible on their way out.
and people expect me to not wanna kms. how, after hearing this shit, am I supposed to be positive in any fucking way. i'm so tired, it makes me cry, i hate everything
he should've said, "while the owl....has a hoot."
It's 2021... Every year the amount of nice things decreases and the amount of horrors increase. Think that isn't going to change anytime soon.
Ahh, america.  Land of the "free"
If we are the greatest nation the sun ever shone upon, it would seem to be mainly because we have been able to goad our wage-earners to this pitch of frenzy. -Upton Sinclair (“The Jungle”)
blah blah comment comment. Increase user engagement to trick youtube platform to recommend video to more people. Blah blah. My opinion is worth about half a shit. Comment comment, this is the only contribution that I can give to the world. Fuck everything.
I got to say betting on family member sounds kind of normal but doesn't need to happen in the work space.
We can't sit back and expect our government representatives to do anything for us. We need to remember that politics is everyone's responsibility. Make a list of your most important issues and send an email or letter to your state and local representatives urging them to consider working towards a solution. If they don't keep their promises, they don't get re-elected. That's how the system works, but it only works if we do our part.   The best thing you can do is organize your needs along with friends, family, and your community. More voices means more pressure. Massive PACs run this country, lobbying for the desires of the rich. The solution is for us citizens to create an army of our own small PACs to remind them who the majority is, and what we need to have in order to fucking live.  It's like storming the capital, but the right way, using our words like grownups.
Republicans in the Reagan era: We need to castrate the US government and severely limit it’s ability to require responsibility of corporations.  Meat packing companies: Thank you.
Who's John Oliver?
I am glad to see you guys getting back to addressing issues like this.
I worked at a meat plant over the summer and the lady on my line in the packaging room cut off her finger and the company offered her a bandage at first. Shit’s disgusting
For many decades, Tyson and other companies have used buses to bring undocumented workers in from Mexico. These workers--under the threat of deportation--don't complain or speak out. Also, they will work for far less than minimum wage! Now THAT is Capitalism in action!!
You suck John Oliver
I was kinda hoping this would be about January 6th...but in the long run, this is SO much more important.
Bet is no big deal. Just a work joke.
You WILL eat the bugs. No meat for you little citizen. Meat is for the tribe leaders only!!!!!!
3:30  Smithfield is a COMMUNIST family!  (Owned by the Chinese family)
I feel like John Oliver saying your phone is more important than food, water, and shelter is a personal call out.
I've been Vegetarian since 1987, & it's not that hard.
How is this #1 on trending. The Late Night Jimi's strike again.
Playing in my head now : Hamlet Chicken Plant Disaster By Jello Biafra & Mojo Nixon
I live one town over from a meat packing plant in TN that was raided by immigration. About 20 people were deported, they knew they were there because no one at the company was paying taxes on the workers. I am sure those people were purposely exploited, they had their lives ruined, and the managers paid a fine and stepped down. I bet they ended up getting rehired after the bus died down. "That's disgusting"
Yet another reason to go vegan. You'd be boycotting an industry that commits so many atrocities in so many different ways.
Corporations are evil.
You've lost it. This show isn't good anymore.
Sure it's a family...a broken, dysfunctional, abusive one....but a family all the same.
Clearly these environments are not humane which will lead to them replacing the employees with machines.  It's a win-win.  Owners don't have to pay insurance or an hourly wage and the current employees can find a job more suitable to their skill set.
It feels worth mentioning that even with the deck stacked this much in their favor, manufacturing is still moving overseas because they want to pay these workers less and avoid even the minor annoyances OSHA and lawsuits give them.
I don't care what he says I like that bathroom and would love to have it
I did security at a Pilgrim's Pride plant in Georgia and the people that hang the chickens had hideous weeping infections on their hands from the claws cutting them and then having bird shit all them
everyday I hate my American citizenship more and more......
Uuggggghhh are we still working on The freakin Jungle?!
This is AMERICA....
Capitalism is a brain disease and is directly responsible for this
sorry but i choose #sixseasonsandmovie
This shouldn't be surprising to anyone.  Depending on how replaceable you are is how any company treats you.  Don't kid yourself if you disagree.
Kentucky's number one export is chicken. Enough said
Zero fucks given?  No.  0.00003% of a fuck given.
So many reasons to cut down on meat. Terrible workers' conditions, environmental impact, and cruel treatment of animals
Judi Dench!
If a company says their culture is like family, that’s a huge huge red flag.
About time we got a new edition of The Jungle, though Upton Sinclair's looking a bit worse for wear these days
Next time your at the market skip the Tyson brand
2:20 how dare you, John Oliver, that’s DAME Judi Dench to you. Show her the respect she has earned
Since when are employees relevant to this guy? Orange man gone, mob news is the new norm 🤣🤣 these guy's are falling off the charts
1:09 Adam Driver is not on the list???
We should have an OSHA investigator walk through every single meat packing plant at a random time every single day. We should have an OSHA rep who visits the plant every day to receive private complaints from the employees. We need to flood this industry with direct oversight, hit the biggest players with massive short term fines, and permanently give every smidge of support we can to these vulnerable employees.
I am so surprised that after this week events in Texas to find out that they are laws helping corporations in workmans comp. From school to work place Texans are fucked.
Damn these CEOs really acting like the ferengi Rule of acquisition 111 "Treat people in your debt like family ... exploit them."
The hypocrisy is that all these comedians have made jokes about the holocaust...
Soooo who won the bet?
Are Americans still confused about why we're getting rocked by Coronavirus?  Also yes, my brother did have to launch a gofundme to help pay for expenses with a massive Hemorrhage I had a couple years ago. Are we  "great again" yet?
The lady in yellow totally had a diaper on while saying how bad it is that workers had to wear diapers
This is beyond depressing.
Ahhhh.... Smell the Capitalism!!
"we're family" is one of the biggest red flag phrases there is.
I never knew that Muppet Porn was a thing that existed until watching last night.
This will not change as long as people keep consuming way more food than they need, which almost everyone in the US is trained to do from an early age. The breakneck speed of those lines exists to satisfy the gaping black hole at the other end.
I hope this show is aware of the amount of incoming dread people feel as soon as their headline of the main story is about something we readily and regularly consume.
Vegan for life, both human and non-human!
The resolute litter comprehensively support because backbone unexpectedly dam midst a symptomatic shirt. dependent, disastrous separated
Remember the The Jungle I remember.
This one really hits home, I use to work in a chicken plant and it was awful, I nearly lost my leg and life before quitting
None of these employee abuses and actual murders would not be remotely possible without government sanctioning. Our government is merely an arm of corporate USA. What is even more amazing than these atrocities (yes more amazing) is that the US electorate actually believes that one of the political parties is for the average citizen. The electorate is so duped that they even cheer on the very people that are screwing them and have been for decades. It is time for a complete overhaul of the government. Many CEO's and members of the US Congress should be arrested and tried. If people have died because of their heinous acts then public hangings would be appropriate. If they (abusers) aren't forced to stop they will continue on with their rein of terror and madness until "1984" looks like picnic! WAKE UP PEOPLE YOUR GOVERNMENT IS KILLING YOU!
A bit of socialism would solve these kind of issues. Put some workplace safety rules and employee protection rights into law. Then create a government funded Osha that has the power to control every single aspect of a business w/o the need for permission, especially when complaints are made. Shut the entire part of the business down until they comply to the rules. The fine should be to keep paying their employees during this time.
Imagine living in a country that wants to use workers like slaves👀 The US is a joke
This is why trade unions were formed a hundred years ago, and the lie of “we are like family” would leave most  workers feeling like they have been disowned if these plants could be moved over seas
Ahh... I didn't realize how much I'd missed my regularly scheduled despair hours...  Thank you Jon, for keeping us informed of the real shit going on in the world.
Suddenly makes a lot of sense why my old work ignored lock out tag out requirements for high voltage equipment maintenance
If you think they treat their workers bad you should see the animals conditions. They however can just quit and leave. It's a shame Oliver keeps talking about the meat industry but avoids the cruel and unethical treatment and slaughter of the animals.
"We will treat you like family" "No thanks, one mother in law is more than enough"
Feast your eyes upon the failures of capitalism.
Me watching this eating steak 👁👄👁
If ranch-flavored triangle-shaped pieces of chicken mush are in part responsible for faster and more dangerous processing line speeds, wait, what’s that? 3 bags are on sale for $2.00? Guess I’m eating “chicken” tonight!!!
Can't take my eyes off the screen,  so happy we got a new season rolling
What. The. Faq. What is that comercial.
Not lunchtime viewing
when i saw meatpacking, i thought it was about lindsey graham!
Wow this guy Shure does like to tell me how to think
13:24 You could do that professionally 🥴
This pisses me off why are we scared to rise up and put a stop to this crap
Time to stop buying from these monsters!
Very happily vegetarian since I was 7.
13:20 lmaoo
All of these violations in the same industry massively contributing  to climate change. It really needs to change
Ok people do something about it Go short the hell of it !! Price of their stock is around $ 60 Reditt  the hell of it Tell all your contacts and friends that every one is going short of those dipshit company owners.
Eating meat at this point in history goes beyond just not caring about animal suffering.   You are actually willing to kill human beings for a few shallow moments of taste pleasure.   I could never comprehend being addicted to anything to that extent.
as a citizen of Des Moines, Iowa...I can assure you the Tyson plant is just a small taste of the idiocrasy of this entire state.  Between Joni Ernst, Kim Reynolds, Chuck Grassley, Steven King, etc etc...pretty much all of our elected officials are corporate scumbags with a twist of open racism and disregard for the poor.  This state is %100 fucked.
Sometimes America sounds like a country out of another planet! How did they manage to get this far with that much irregularity and corruption?
It's America The white Privilege breaks the law and gets paid for it but america would rather harass people of color and refuse that there is racism we as people of color outnumber them in the past white Privilege stole Land and treasure they called it freedom well let's get some freedom for us the time is now 😊☺️ we the people of color must demand More or take more  White Privilege is Terrorism
So what are unions doing these days? Nothing? Being corrupt and rewarding senior members and union leadership while letting the junior members and customers suffer? And what's the government doing? Nothing? Being corrupt and rewarding the rich and political allies? Hmmm.
This show confuses me, when Trump was in office its all about corruption and dirty politicians. I'm still waiting for the show about the Newly-confirmed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen receiving $810,000 in speaking fees from the hedge fund that bailed out one of the primary losers in the recent Gamestop frenzy. It almost seems bias at times.
That's late stage capitalism for ya folks.
Did anybody really expect to be treated well by companies that make profits off of the slaughter and mistreatment of other living beings...
Can we expect a video on farmer's protest in India soon?
Rich people break the law with Jon oliver.
Do we need more reasons to stop eating so much meat?
Did john oliver just read the jungle?
Fun question with fun legal implications: does this mean they've been packing and shipping Covid19 infected products?
That was disgusting! xD
will never understand how never taking sick days has become a sign of hard work... like, how can someone now have gotten sick in nearly 30 years it's impossible??? the only logical conclusion is that they fell sick but were forced to work because of toxic and oppressive corporate policies. america is HELL for the majority of people living there.
Weirdly, my order is a little different:  1. Phone 2. Food, Water, and Shelter 3. Betty White, since she's a fucking WORLD TREASURE 4. Family  That feels a bit more accurate, though #3 could also be Dolly Parton for the same reason. FUCKING WORLD TREASURE...
There're so many outstanding programs like The Daily Show (Trevor Noah), The Late Show (Stephen Colbert), Late Night (Seth Meyers), or Jimmy Kimmel Live.  But personally, my favorite is still John Oliver.  One big reason is John Oliver not only focuses on politics; instead, he tackles the variety of problems in society.  His mission is to VOICE for those who do NOT have a voice themselves.  This, to me, is the definition of GREATNESS.
Oh look John Oliver talking about trump and shitting on America. How rare.
i almost want hbo just to watch you. love this show
Tyson was playing "Chicken" with COVID.
That's why republicans want small government, so they could just change employee contracts to slave contracts and get it over with.
Why is it so hard to fathom that happy workers work more effectively resulting in the company earning more. All the ceo's care about is short-term profits.
The only real way to stop this is to stop paying for it to happen.
All of these woke idiots complaining about the system because of this video are the problem.   Offer solutions without fucking over other people just trying to get by.   America can be bent in a bad way, or it can be bent in a great way; woke idiots only see it bend the wrong way because they are themselves.
The fine has to be 10% of their profits. That’s when they’ll actually make any changes
10:40 that guy's face is too small for his head. Like he's from the Lil Bits commercial from Rick and Morty.
Dear Americans, why are you still tolerating this shareholder focused system? I hope you'll fare better soon....
Everything is fine, the American dream is alive and doing well. Keep going to the USA, its the best place to live under the sun. Everybody is being treated equally , you have all the freedoms you need and can fill your house with guns if that's what your heart desires
The U.S. is a nightmare
Despicable
Pork processing plant.  I’m gonna be sick.
Can you please post your sources for these facts in the description of this video??? I am seriously intrigued and am happy to hear all these insane facts that I can now bring to the table amongst conversations with friends.   But I don't want to randomly google things and pray what I find is the facts.   Rather, i feel like all news sources especially if they are able to post segments youtube should maybe consider having a small biblio in their descriptions.   Not only to spread facts as true, but also to have any 'fake-news' trolls stopped in their tracks.   Just food for thought <3
Tyson is disgusting. I've been thinking about going vegatari again...
I wish we had local butchers and farmers. I dont know who want this.
Note to self: Do not support these companies.
Congratulations on 1# trending!
Sequel to "The Jungle", 2021, colorized
Racial minorities don't know how to use the internet. - Joe Biden.
There needs to be a retraction in next weeks episode. The face on that bust was too proportional to be that alien pilgrim thing.
that’s why i only eat free-range, humanely handled meat
So you all have time and creativity to add multiple animal r*pe jokes to every video, but you're not going to discuss animal cruelty while discussing animals literally being tortured and slaughtered? Animals and their right to exist outside of our interests have been a central part of the last two videos and you've glossed right over both. This is so disappointing. You're choosing to tackle an extremely important topic where animals and humans are intertwined and separating it out I'm unhelpful ways. Do better.
Thats one more major reason, among dozens, to go vegan.
I remember reading The Jungle back in high school. Meat packing was even worse back then
Im a custodian at an elementary school. Maybe one week could we talk about us? Its been hard work this past year. Always less than ideal conditions. Proud to do it tho.
Damn, normally Jon ends it on a high note.. this was just straight depressing
Wiiiiiiiillllllldddddd
uff ich kann nur hoffen, dass ich in den nächsten 30 minuten nicht herausfinde, dass es so etwas auch in  Deutschland gibt....
Fucking corporate people don’t care about the bottom 80% for the most part
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yy8TbqqSyQg&feature=youtu.be
Iceage farmer called this agenda 2021 gavi 😃🤚use Google thank me later lol
Ik im gonna sounds super dumb but I started eating meat from farmers i knew and met when i lived with my aunt and i SWEAR it has ruined all mainstream packaged meat for me. The worst is chicken, then pork, then beef. Chicken its like I can taste the anxiety and fear. Pork its like i can taste the depression and despair. Beef is similar, just not as prevalent.
I KNOW for a solid gold 100% fact that a Smithfield plant in northern Illinois that a line worker died from Covid 2 days after her last shift at Smithfield. Smithfield closed the plant for 24 hours for a clean / disinfection and then..everybody back on the line. When a worker asked to leave early, they were told no, as the one day they were closed put "them" behind..
4:00
This is capitalism run amock.
...How do you think meetings where all these people come together to slash workers comp, decide if employees can go to the bathroom or not and what to do if someone get sick or injured or dies go? you think they acknowledge the fact that these are people and not robots they're employing for even a nanosecond? I can only imagine one of 2 ways this goes: they must either literally talk in nothing but numbers and what expenses will do to their bottom line without ever acknowledging they have people working for them, or they go something like "ok lets say an employee loses their arm in an accident, should we pay them something" "Oh i know, we offer them a pittance of $20 and tell them if they go to anyone to complain, they're instantly fired and they dont get a single cent for trying to rat on us" "um that sounds like a horrible plan" *CEO glares menacingly* "...are we gonna have fucking problem here?..." "uhh no but you really think?-" "these people are the bottom of the barrel and we are their fucking lords and saviors for giving them these jobs, if they wanted to work somewhere that treats them like people, and not be fearing bodily harm every day of their lives maybe they shouldnt be *peasants!!!* "
Only a photo of the AFL-CIO logo but not one comment about the total uselessness of this union since Lane Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO from 1979 to 1995, sold out its union members to Reagan and the neo-cons.  Remenber the destruction of the air traffic controllers' union.  Kirkland was more interested in helping the CIA out by funding the Polish Soldiarity movement.  Those meatpacker workers you describe have marginally more rights than slaves while their employers, like Tyson, get away with murder.  Thanks to the still totally sold-out AFL-CIO union.
Rank...  God,  Loved ones (including family)  Food, clothing, & shelter I know it was a joke. But with the craziness of today's world, I think people need to hear this. You matter. People matter. There is still a great amount of love in the world. Hope you have a pleasant day. 😁❣️
The best way to lower demand for these companies is to eat less meat :)
14:30 Pretty sure walking through a plant with a box on your head is an OSHA violation.
The production lines are not going to slow down unless there is a paradigm shift in how work performance is measured.  It is very easy to show job performance by counting how many cases came off the line at the end of the day and if that line met that day's schedule.  It's an easy number that makes the CEO, CFO, and the management teams look good on paper no matter the living hell that those on the production line have to go through in order to achieve it.  Until a worker's accident's and quality issues are directly charged against that line on that day, not as overhead but as direct costs, you'll never have management recognize how their greed for  speed is killing the American workforce.
So this "anti-union" thingy, how is that working for you U.S?
i know any retirees would volunteerr to be inspectors unpaid
September 2020 - the Trump Administration fines Smithfield, a multi-billion dollar pork processor, just $13,000 after 1,300 meatpacking workers got sick.  That's $10 per worker for giving them COVID-19. It's no wonder corporations get away with abusing their workers.
OPT OUT GO VEGAN.  The working conditions are inhumane and disgusting, the animals living and dying conditions are inhumane and disgusting.  The meat, made from stressed, sick animals, processed by exploited workers, is disgusting.  We don't need it and we can do better for our bodies, for each other, for the animals, and for the environment--all of which is sacred.
This reminds me of Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle", which was meant to hit Americans in the hearts regarding poor conditions in Chicago Meat Processing Plants... but it primarily hit American in the stomach. People are more upset about how the meat they eat is treated than the people whose job it is to process those meats.
So we industrialize are farms, leave imperfect food on the ground to rot, and hog/dairy/beef farms can generate hundreds of thousands of dollars of manure a day(each), industrialize the food production to the point, where workers wear diapers on the line (if not just openly pee on it).  And yet.... millions of Americans still can't afford to feed their families.    I'm not saying we shouldn't put our foot down and force these industries to chill the fuck down and fix their shit because it's getting everywhere...  but it's going to be very difficult to not make even more families go hungry.
I love the way John uses his "for my lawyer" disclaimers to continue trashing the company
That clip of office workers doing exercises to say fit would not have triggered my radar normally. But viewed inside the context of what the plant workers go through, it's an instant HOLY SIDEWAYS-FUCKING SHIT-- oh uh sorry, I mean 'Oinkhub'.
Their whole business model is butchering the living.  Plus the animals ...
What can be done? Well you know how to cut.      What the fuck else should you do when the law is bullshit?    Remember people burning to death in exploding pintos?   Well guess if someone else was a little more afraid of that fate it would not have happened. The law doesn't work.        Your death is cheaper
https://youtu.be/jTCw2OTzAi0
OSHA = crippled. SEC = crippled. EPA = crippled. As always, corporate interests reign supreme in the USA.
do the  VETERAN AFFAIRS HOSPITALS DO THE VETERAN AFFAIRS HOSPITALS DO THE VETERAN AFFAIRS HOSPITALS
Don't wanna be that guy, but I feel a lot better watching these kinda news since I ditched the meat. Taste is just habit anyway.
Another reason to consider a plant-based diet, not only is eating meat itself unethical, we have reached the point where the meat businesses treat their workers unethically.
15000$ per person, the price of human life in US. I guess we did progress thanks to inflation
You wanna know whats great about this. No more Trump on this show, now we can go back to other depressing problems.
We need star trek replicator tech lmao 🤣 so we can stop doing this.
There are messed up sh*t to correct on this world like this, and yet SJWs is what take the covers
USA = Worst Western industrial country to live in.  Unless you are rich. Then USA is the very best. No tax. No social or environment responsibility, just cash in. Yippee ki yay
I find it outrageous that the human is treated as the vicitm here, even though the much more serious moral crisis are the exploited and mass murdered animals in this slavish system that causes environmental destruction, diabetes, obesity and pandemics
Im waiting for some presidential jokes.
It looks like plant owners read The Jungle by Upton Sinclair and said "Yeah, let's do *more* of that!"
I'm so glad to be in europe
I have never bought anything from Tyson. Im proud of that.
I have not eaten meat today.... yet
Stop buying from major packing plants get your meet from Whole Foods you don’t have to do all your shopping there just meat. You will notice the difference! And it’s not much more expensive at all.
Anyone who thinks America is the greatest country in the world needs to see this.
Seems like nothing in your country is immune from lobbying...  Fucking every law passed is pjshed by some lobbyist... That's grim and sad and undemocratic
I honestly miss the live audience. The jokes just feel like they've fallen flat since they're subtle
@lastweektonight: Thank you for this.This situation is same sh*t, different century,, but it’s not “The Jungle”. It’s the Triangle Fire of March 25, 1911 in NYC. .Any of these details sound familiar? Immigrant employees treated like commodities (called “assets”, “capital” & locked in),; basic human needs disregarded in favor of production; greedy owners’ manipulation & exploitation of rules, lax regulations; corrupt or indifferent local politicians who look the other way or - at best - never follow up.. The direct result of all this in 1911 was a fire that murdered almost 150 people in under 20 minutes and, finally, some level of reckoning on workplace safety and unions in the U.S. Apparently, however, avarice trumps humanity & lessons learned from history. Pun intended. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_Shirtwaist_Factory_fire   PS: it drives me absolutely BONKERS, when people use the word “literally” but mean it figuratively. Keep fighting that good fight for all of us!
I love this guy, he could just be a comedian and make lots and lots of money, but he puts his nuts on the table being an activist. One wrong word could cost him everything, but he still does his show his way.
good job john oliver lets bash small businesses when they are struggling the most
Simple solution: GO VEGAN!
"Cluckingham palace"
I wish every person would have to raise, butcher and cook an animal just once. There might be more respect for the people who do those jobs on farms and in factories. Buy your meat from a local Meat Locker or the Amish or local farms.
I guess going vegan now has even more benefits! ;D
meat industry is absolutely disgusting through and through  torturing animals their whole life just to kill them  working people to death destroying the planet making people sick just go vegan and you can legit all those things
I worked for a food processing company who would put 5 gallon buckets of industrial bleach in the water of the final processing line to change the color of spoiled food product so that they could still sell it. I can only imagine the atrocities that go on around this country in other processing plants.
thank you for taking on these pirates. Factory farming needs to be curtailed and OSHA ha LONG needed laws with teeth and inspectors;
God help us
It's been said that there are jobs white people and black people don't want to do, yet those same people get pissed off when poor people of color say "we'll do it" and put up with poor pay/poor conditions.  And yet white and black people are more than willing to arrest and deport and overcharge same people, then complain prices go UP. So then the vegans/vegetarians start crawling out of the woodwork, only to find "mega"farms and "organic" groceries and stores (hey there, Whole Foods). Who the hell you think own the farms? The organic co-ops? The farmlands being taken over for apartments, condos, homes, and the tax bases geared towards you guessed it, food purveyors of every ilk. And I would guess those of you who don't mind the police killing people of color to keep them down and fail to recognize that white people are next on their list that the willingness/failure to control a pandemic, food deserts or even vaccine distribution or terrorism [foreign and domestic] shouldn't be surprised by the Republican responses, the Epsteins of the world, or your unwillingness to protect your friends and your families. When it was poor people freezing their asses off in Chicago, Detroit, New York, they deserved it, but Texas grinds to a halt and they want to blame the companies responsible NOW? You see what Cruz did. Expect more of the same.
A "comedian" explaining government oversight, is like AOC explaining particle physics.
I'll never look at an immersion blender the same. Thanks for that.
You guys should post about the segment on texas power grid on YouTube for the world to see.  It was definitely less of an entertainment program and more of a PSA Considering the actions of the states elected officials
My father worked at a meat packing plant 35 years ago.  Not much has changed.  It was that bad in the late 80s.
Let me save you about 20 minutes" Be pretentious about something he doesn't like the end"
SHUT DOWN FACTORY FARMS!
It’s funny when I hear republicunts that they want less government. Or that the government is the problem. CAPITALISM will exploit u if it’s not regulated. Look what’s happening in Texas with the electrical companies. All of that could’ve been prevented. But TX have always been a lapdog for the GOP. Maybe this time they’ll learn. Jerry Jones already worth about 6 billions but that’s not enough for him. Al least we have someone mindful in the WH at the moment. But remember politicians r only puppets of the big capitalists.
Nice to have you and your show back! Thanks for being an American!
I worked in a soda factory for 3 years, this is spot on.
I love when right wing types say "You don't want a chicken sandwich at McDonalds to cost $15 do you?". YES. If that's how much it costs to safely make one, then yes I do. I'd love to be able to buy a new Tesla for $5000, but if they way they did it was using slave labor I think I'd go ahead and pass. Have a fucking moral backbone.
also the most likely place a new pandemic is gunna start from is in meat processing plants. these places need to be completely overhauled or shut down.
Vegetarian for nearly 5 years. No regrets.
And it's all worth it because RACISM and TAX CUTS. These factories are in deep red states, they don't even care about themselves why should the company?
I already know. I live in Rantoul, IL. All we have is a meat packing plant and a bunch of fast foot restaurants.. oh, and a Wal-Mart
This why I don't support this industry... just disgusting all around.
Capitalism is the most lethal deadly cancer
I realize that it would throw out the existing workers, but why Isn’t this automated? Wouldn’t that save these companies lots of money? Am I missing something here?
Tyson: “Workers are our family” Also Tyson: “we always hurt the ones we love”
i can spot these spineless management types the moment they throw "like family" out there w/o even earning the respect of the rank n file!
This share of the mass of work for OSHA just highlights an event in my life as even more idiotic.  I worked in a toxicology lab, and one of my coworkers filed a bogus workplace safety claim.  So for two weeks, we had an OSHA guy in our lab, watching and documenting everything we did.  He found absolutely nothing wrong except that we didn't have a guide on how not to be stupid in a lab (so we got a tiny fine for that).  After that bogus claim was shot down, the (now former) employee then turned around and filed a discrimination claim (the individual had quit the position, stating they didn't feel safe, despite all tests proving there was no hazard) - again with OSHA.  So another week was taken up by meetings with a board of three individuals from OSHA questioning a bunch of people from managers, to our CEO, to myself (as the in-the-trenches coworker of the claimant).  I can't even imagine how many actual problems they could be investigating if those 4 people didn't have 3 weeks wasted on just this 1 person making false claims.
It's sad to remember all the shocking info I discover from LWT videos and then realize how normal and common knowledge this video's information is in the Midwest, where I live. Like we've been desensitized to the abuse from the plants around here and we've come to expect it.
To make matters worse, the loss of revenue from having to implement safety measures that will slow down line production times will be passed onto you, the consumer, since there is no way Billion dollar companies will absorb the cost.
Oh Capitalism… the enemy of the worker
La esclavitud moderna en la industria de empacadoras de carne. ¡Muevan las industrias!
Please do one for warehouse jobs such as Fedex, UPS and Amazon. I've worked in all three and they're all insane. When you work "part-time" you get no bathroom break but state laws, country laws states 5-15minute break per 2 hour work loads. Fedex is really terrible.    Granted the boom in online buying because of all the millennials; jobs in these warehouses are literally chaos.
Corporations referring to their workers as family is a dead give away for how they don’t care about even their own families.
And, outrage of outrages, a lot of that meat is being sold to China!
Not just meatpacking industry, it's all industries that have as MASS produced concept. The company claims safety but doesn't do anything to help it. Pretty much say ITS UP TO THE EMPLOYEES TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES
I remember reading about all this in "Fast Food Nation" back in 2004.  Sadly, pretty much nothing has changed since then, it seems.
It feels as if we haven't progressed since the Industrial revolution.
I'm so disgusted with our country
I don't think there's any logical difference between a "Campaign contribution"(legal or not) and a bribe.  The only difference is campaign contributions need to be laundered as campaign expenses.
what the fuck is this i was here for an orange man bad rant
https://youtu.be/sDAzpO2Boo8  Hey there! I know we don’t know each other but idk if you’ve seen me posting about this recently or not but this is the YouTube series I’m starting. We’re in the process of filming episode 2 soon. I’m super excited about it! If you haven’t done so already you should subscribe to the YouTube channel and follow the IG page. Thanks 🙏🏼   @bmoreindi
The mostly powerful country in the world.  Big private companies treat their workers like used up trash.
becoming vegetarian, significantly cutting meat intake or changing your resources to save workers and animals has never been more compelling, thanks john
Yeah I thought my job at Amazon was bad... being treated like a robot, being treated as disposable as a robot when you break, having your wellbeing neglected like a Robot until you break and are thrown away, the need to wear a diaper or just not take bathroom breaks in order to work at the breakneck speeds you need to. Those are all things very familiar at Amazon warehouses. Luckily any sharp objects we use are made safer so we can't cut people without genuinely trying to, and also we aren't working with dead animals or food products so if anything happens we don't have to worry about making thousands violently ill... Worst part about it is, if Amazon paid 30$ an hour I would have no problem working in the conditions at their warehouses, and if the meatpacking industry paid 45-50$ an hour I wouldn't mind working in those conditions...unfortunately they don't, and while Amazon pays 15$ an hour base and thats a reasonable rate for any other job it is not enough for how they treat you. I don't know how much these meat packing workers are paid but considering 6 of their lives were bought will 15,000 dollars or just about 2500$ a life I'd say it isn't anywhere close to fucking enough.
*adds "Meatpacking Industry Executives" to "List of people who will be the first up against the wall when the revolution comes"*
I know he says in the beginning that everyone talks about the animal cruelty aspects of this, but it seems amiss to *not* include that aspect of it.  Fuck the meatpacking industry, and may more people wake up to the fact that meat is *unnecessary* .
So happy I do not live in that God-abandoned country, but it's nice to go to for holiday! :)
We need to stop with all this "fine" bullshit and start criminalizing this stuff. No fines for these conditions, instead, a minimum of 30 years in prison.
Its crazy how many jobs don't allow for basic human functions, like using the restroom. I'm a teacher, in a normal year its hard enough to find time to use the restroom but with Covid measures its even worse. Usually I could run in during class change, not anymore, that time is for sanitizing desks so my students can eat in my classroom. I'd like this show to cover what's actually happening in schools during Covid times, not what the school boards and government entities are making it out to be this "safe" place for students to be.
Same problem in Germany where a "meat factory" was shut down twice last year. Cheap workes from Eastern Europe have to live in small houses. I think that was the main problem their, next to 5 guys in one car on their way to work.  One reason not mentioned here: People dont want to pay more for meat.  Maybe in the US the Reps would cry communism if politics want to strengthen workers rights.
I'd bet those managers that got fired were given lots of money first. Socialism of the rich. That's the capitalism republicans choose. Socialism for the wealthiest lol and they say they are against it 🤣
‘You vil eat ze bugs.’
I wonder what the core underlying issue behind all this bullshit is..hm....
I mean, Target does it too. LMAO.
when you see that cheeys ad and smile knowlingy because you know that company is f*cked
This is why labor needs teeth in America.
but exactly what can we do about this?
If a company tells you they are like a family, they will surely make your family less important. Family is family, workplace is workplace. You don't work in your family for payments.
Ahh finally get to hear about other stuff other than Tr*mp! Thank goodness honorable, righteous, Joe Biden is president now!
Comment
i feel sorry for mr oliver your family must suck. mine is the most important thing to me.
lol who is disliking this video.
Next video, how ranchers feel about the dropping prices of meat that meat packing plants are willing to pay, which means more profit for the plants.
It's sooo disgusting and inhuman! I'm from Switzerland and I thought we should improve the methods here (what we should!) , but now i'm lucky to buy my "suisse- meat"....
If somebody told me to put a box over my head before walking me around heavy machinery that causes amputations I'd consider that a murder attempt.
Upton Sinclair wrote "The Jungle" in 1906. Horrific portrayal of these same dynamics.
I get my beef and pork from an environmentally awake independent farmer and it is processed by an independent meet cutter. Do not throw guinea pigs, just dropping one will most likely kill it.
This is our fault. We need to change this brokenness. This is capitalism or conscience. If companies are "people" by color of law then they are serial killers and they need to be locked up for public safety.
Amazing what is possible in the US. Are there no laws?
Okay, I paused at 45 seconds.  I haven't watched TV in quite a while but my guess is Perdue entrees?  I've never had one but, am I right?  If I'm wrong, I'm sorry.
time to find a small local farm to get  meat from . . .  or go vegetarian
Damn, number one on trending xD
Capitalists care about money, not people
The problem isnt a lack of regulation. The problem is capitalism itself. If workers can be coerced through money to perform these functions without input into decisions, the system is the problem
Ngl I kind of love that they had a virus betting pool. I mean its so easy to affect the results and its also delectibly evil
"We don't need unions anymore" they said. "Their just taking your money" they said.
Companies calling themselves families automatically creeps me out.
This is painful
I know people that steal from family so I rarely care if someone considers me "family"
Me: oh man can’t wait to watch LWT during my lunch break! Me, 5 minutes later: I’ve made a huge mistake
So American corporations are taking advantage of and manipulating underprivileged and disenfranchised individuals? This has been happening since 1776, I doubt anyone is surprised.
well to be fair, they do treat their workers like family. the ads never say thats a good thing
Americans wonder - and complain - that we Europeans dont want their food products, indeed most of them are banned from the EU due to the horrendous food and health standards. While we Europeans wonder, why on Earth Americans put up with eating toxic sludge.
So John is pulling an Upton Sinclaire?
"We're a family" is company for "we underpay employees, offer few benefits, and demand sacrifices of them all for our profit." No company is a family, unless its owned and run by one, and then I'd never want to work there.
Thanks for putting these on YouTube
Someone resurrect theodor roosevelt and tell him what's up.
음.. ㅇㅇ?!
I heard these stories about Tyson since I was a child, i bet most of these workers are illegal immigration so they won’t complain out fear.
How could John Oliver put Judy Dench above Betty White. Yes, Judy Dench is great and everything, but she is no Betty White. Respect Betty White, John.
A John Oliver story that is about something other than Donald Trump or COVID?? Is this real life??
Trump Won By A Landslide!!! New Facts!!! 221 thousand Pennsylvania votes switched from Trump to Biden 941 thousand Pennsylvania deleted from system 2.7 million votes were deleted Nation wide 435 thousand nationwide switched from Trump to Biden  ...
I hope you shed light on the farmers protests! The world and India  really needs you John.
This shows days are gone.......learn when to let go
tyson are a family more specifically a mafia one
Amazons fulfillment centers is what comes to mine
John is on fire with his topics this year 🔥
It's pointless to give rich people a fine, they simply see it the same way poor people see a movie ticket.
But but in social studies in high school like 15 years ago they told us it all ended with "The Jungle". Just like how racism ended when MLK Jr was shot. /s
Be vegan
Tragicly,  we had the same issues in Germany in spring, big headlines (just google "Toennies" and "corona ") without any major changes.  Seems to be a World wide problem of this industry
I love John, but I also love meat... so I am going to force myself to watch this..
I just want one day for animals to lead an uprising and treat humans how we've treated them
Well, that's capitalism at its finest. Why capitalism is not ideal, because people stop being people and become assets and can get replaced like any broken piece of equipment.
Our household made ~$75k last year; that fine would've amounted to $2.20 for us. That's fucking insane. Even more insane is that if we were hit with a $15k fine our house would feel it, but overall our quality of life wouldn't really suffer and we'd be fine.  I can't help but imagine how hard the execs were laughing at a $15k fine.
As someone who owns 5 squeaky loafs take this as a psa: DO NOT GIVE GUINEA PIGS MILK. They are lactose intolerant and strict vegans!
I suddenly feel the urge to punch some meatpacking facility owners...
did this guy write a campaign check for Trump?
America is hell. The only thing worse I can think of about North Korea is that I might be killed for saying that.
What the hell how is this number one on trending
"They're taking our jobs"
.00003 isn't a fraction, to be clear it is 3/100,000 thats not a fraction, thats not even a fraction of a fraction.... thats a fucking fraction on top of a fraction on top of another fraction with a cherry like fraction on  top for good fucking measure.
I wonder what would happen if he covered the book the Doomsday Machine of Daniel Ellsberg, the Big brother of the Pentagon Papers
Read Sinclair Lewis's book, The Jungle. not much has changed.
Just one more reason of the MANY, MANY reasons to give up animal flesh. yuck. 🤮 It's bad for your skin, bad for your fat belly, rots in your intestines, and gives you stank breath... bad for the environment, and cruel to animals... so many reasons 🤢🤢🤢
Rest assured absolutely nothing will get done about the horrible conditions in these plants. Democrats or Republicans in power, doesn't really matter, the lobbyists will get to them and "persuade " them to do the right (wrong) thing.
Also, John, we tend to have this whole NIMBY thing when it comes to the meat packing industry, and factory farms. We don't want them around so they're out in the middle of BFE around small towns without any other opportunities. That's the way the Hillandale eggplant is in Hicksville Ohio. And the pay was miserable.
Grew up in Iowa. Live in South Dakota. Nothing I heard in this show was news to me.
646841
John you should know better than to just blame lack of OSHA teeth for the problems with all the industries. It's true, but not the root cause of the issue. When I got certified by OSHA they informed me during the class that for example NYS, has just 9 inspectors for all standard manufacturing plants. The root cause is the lack of staffing at OSHA, the sheer workload is why the fines are reducible to the point that there's no point filing the paperwork.  Deep Dive (three parts please) on the problems with OSHA would be great
Unions...
'this is not our country' ma'am, as an outsider let me say this is exactly what your country is about.
This unfortunatly is a problem that is not only present in the US. In Germany (Western europe's go-to spot for cheap meat) it is simmilar. The majority of workers are from eastern europe and the gouvernment allowed the companies to pay the workers less then minimum wage. These practices lead to scandals involving deaths due to contaminated meat every other year and to horrible conditions to the workers. (Examples: wilke Wurst and Tönjes).  It really is sad, what lengths companies go to to sell cheaper meat / increase profits.
Can we please add the laughs in the back again
Over 100 years ago Upton Sinclair covered this same topic in his seminal work 'The Jungle'. 100 years later, many of the same criticisms and conditions remain and many have even gotten worse. We are in a new gilded age, but the layer of gold over the layers of shit and rot is thinner than ever.
There is no right way to do the wrong thing. Eating other animals is killing us and our planet.
Are there any owners of big companies who're not inhumane sociopaths?!?
This might be a good time to point out that republican politicians, those guys who "represent" the vast majority of rural and working class citizens, are actively fighting against President Biden's push to support labor unions.
Y'all need to read the jungle book. Shit was wild back then
We've gone full circle back to The Jungle
There are more worker rights in Asia than there is in the USA.
No more recorded laughters no more humour
Good reporting, but the video's audio seems to have been mastered a bit low on this one.  Even turned up all the way it is still a bit soft.
I was positive it was a commercial about mad cow disease. I felt even more confident when I saw the chicken guy. Then he ruined it. 🥺
Imagine not investing in bitcoin  N having to keep going to one of these jobs 😩😩
The first ad - now that's amazing marketing!!
This is exactly what unfettered capitalism gets us, and it is definitely not unique to the Meatpacking industry.
Fun fact, JBS owns Pilgrims. JBS is also a leader in pork, huge international company
wow 6 dead people for only 15,000 dollars thats impressive thats like buying peoples lives at a 99c store... Republicans talk about how ineffective government are, but they seem to forget that Republicans are the primary *REASON* the government is ineffective. Sure there are parts of the government that are ineffective that the Republicans wholeheartedly support, take our massive defense budget, either there is a lot of excess spending that is wasteful or we spend a shit ton too much on our military. There is also the presidency from 2017 until early  2021, there is congress. Allowing a company to buy the deaths of 6 people for a measly 2,500 a pop is beyond disgusting, Satan would look at that and say "well God damn, they were worth at least 5,000 each."
Any time someone says "deregulation" I only hear "Let's make stuff way less safe to get more $$$ up to the 1%"  But people buy it up, we have some of the smartest and most evil humans on the planet teaming up to trick the most disadvantaged into fucked up stuff.  #1:care #2:share,  it's a really simple solution to most social economic issues.
Wtf and I thought the meatpacking industry in my country was bad.
I’m very curious about the conditions in kosher plants. I keep strictly kosher, and there’s always been a security in that. I certainly know that they’re not going to let any random things fall in, but I would like to know the actual conditions. I hope it would be better, because Jewish law requires you to treat your employees well. Unfortunately, many Jews obey the letter of Jewish law without the spirit. I’d love to get some insight into this.
Greetings from Germany. He may as well have been talking about Tönnies, a company in which one of our largest Covid outbreaks happened last year, to no one's surprise. It's a little depressing to see that this industry is the same everywhere.
Seize the means of production.
Unforgivable. We must remove money from politics. But how do we dislodge money from judicial process, without tampering with penalties and compensation?
The OSHA system is completely broken
This kind of blatant disregard for human rights is absolutely disgusting! I am tired of corporations taking advantage of peoples lives for a profit!
Pretty sure you left Adam Driver off the list of creatures that consider you "meat", John. Was that modesty?
My area local ABC affiliate made the video!  WZZM out of Grand Rapids, except two of these ladies have moved on from the station.
This will be exhibit 1 in my argument for why black people wash their meat.  ijs
The way that this video didn't even touch on the ICE raids within Tyson facilities... meat companies are truly egregious
just go vegan people. for the people - and the animals
cant wait until we are all eating bugs for protein
The NY Times had a podcast about this a few months ago. Glad to see more organizations shining a light on this topic. Meatpacking employees' health affects everyone else's health - especially during COVID season.
We can't expect the government to fix these problems.  What we can do is UNITE in no longer buying their product.  It's simple:  Consumers must TAKE CONTROL of the market.
I am the exception to the rule as I married up and have a daughter cooler than I deserve.
I honestly hope he covers electronics retail and grocery during the pandemic this season. Those workers need a voice right now.
John Oliver, two words: Lyme Disease
Hey American workers, democratic socialism ist very bad! You get harsh safety rules for companies, you get 25 days of paid vacation a year minimum, companies can't fire you for no reason at all times, free healthcare (at point of service, paid via taxes), unions for almost everything which guarantee that your salary increases every single year, harsh working hours laws which will basically guarantee your overtime payment, etc. It's a nightmare! Don't force your politicians to implement it. It's unbearable! Greetings from the hellhole Europe.
I blame the people for wanting to work for decades while wearing diapers ! I mean, come on, get some self respect will you ?
When are you going to do an episode on the GOVERNOR of NY murdering thousands of elderly and then attempting to cover it up?  He accepted an Emmy and wrote a book during all of this too... comedy gold!!!
Texas continues to show us how stupid deregulation is.
John thinks he's a LOT funnier than he actually is..
Only came here to ask how this dude likes having a sewage treatment plant named after him
Thank you for sharing this information
Omg Oliver, you're only 43?!? That's a mere 15 years older than me; if I were single and didn't know who you were I would've swiped right. You'd only be the third-oldest person I've dated anyway.
Can someone remind of any perks for living in this stupid country.
Another good reason to go Vegan !
The people disliking the vid are the executives and their families of these shitty ass companies who got “offended” by John exposing their own doings
I was against firing Roseanne being fired just out of principle. Still, even I had to admit about a year ago that The Conners is a much better show without her.  The original 90s show is still the best, but what they're doing now beats the pants off that first season with Roseanne still on the show.
"Food companies can police themselves"..... ya how's that going? Poorly? SHOCKING!!
Capitalism at it's raw power.
Anyone else find it disgusting that after talking about people being treated like human machine John Oliver immediately makes a joke about wanting to be. Like that just takes away from the story and the horror these people go through
Go vegan. This April will mark 7 years for me. Best decision ever.
No, you are a perverted owl
#GoVegan

Who won the betting pool? Because someone who bet 10 is very different than the one who bet 1500.
Watching this while smugly eating my venison chili
I work as a French interpreter in Iowa and almost every job is for French Africans who are going to therapy from injuries at their meat-packing jobs.
I feel lucky today
“Trump’s out of office, now what do we cover?”  The brutal economic impact of government COVID regulations?  “No”  The shady ties between the Biden administration and China’s communist party and the ongoing genocide of Uyghur Muslims?  “Nah”  The cities who are backpedaling on their ‘defund the police’ initiatives as crime rates skyrocket most impacting low-income minority communities?  “MEATPACKING!”
Same thing here in Germany. There was a lot of public outcry when the problems surfaced in light of COVID. Less meat would greatly benefit the whole planet!
Sad for so many reasons
John Oliver set the bar on how to utilize the word "FUCK"....such an eloquent wordsmith...
People who think that the US is the greatest country are willfully ignorant.
Welcome to america where factory workers get fked, chopped my thumb half off at a plastics factory when i was young. It was a bitch then to get the company to fking pay the med bills
That Perdue commercial is the stuff of my literal nightmares.
Wait, you mean the people who torture and slaughter billions of animals each year don't care about the health and well-being of others?  Ohhhhh nnooooo 😱😱😱
"But socialism bad". Is it really worse than this? The answer is no
Hmmm,  OSHA scored a role in the new "Bird Box" movie!
Oinkhub lol
Literally anytime i watch a john oliver video all i think is "clearly we need to turn off capitalism and turn it back on because its clearly broken and needs a reboot"
American corporations: “We are like a family“  Me: “Well, my family fucking sucks” check you later
Go Vegan! 🐜
Pray there's a hell.
Today is the day that angy Zazu finally makes it up the trending ladder to the coveted #1 spot, as it should be.
Just another compelling reason to be a vegetarian. I also encourage my fellow catholics to challenge themselves this lent by giving up meat for lent.
Commie
The way he was talking about that Pilgrim guy was a little reminiscent. Eat bird, Pilgrim coming soon?
What's with the random % implying racism's without evidence cmon Oliver you're better than that
There is so little on earth that I dislike and pisses me off as much as Purdue
Democrats own all 3 branches now. What are they doing to improve conditions for Americans? We all know what will happen to wait for Republican bipartisan to help Americans.
Lmfao I grew up in Salisbury 😭 Yass J drag the perdues
Another reason to go vegan
Wow!
Perdue is shit too! Stopped eating them a couple years ago too.
Being treated like an immersion blender is not as fun as it might seem. Just ask any kid who who got a swirly in middle school.... Who am I kidding John probably got a swirly last week.
When I found myself at the mercy of yet another employer offering  compensation well under a living wage and within the same $2.00/hr margin as every other job opportunity in the state.    If it's assembly, retail, fast food, warehouse, moving or construction labor, the starting pay isn't more than anywhere else is paying.     Refuse to participate in a hiring pool that takes advantage of the hardest working people by paying them the least is a privilege that few people in the position to do so, actually do. With stagnant wages in a state that remains to have no more than the federal $7.25 minimum wage requirement.    At what point is earning nothing a better use of time than not earning enough for 40 hours a week?    I have bills and people to take care like everyone else but if the only offers are being dehumanized for slave wages, I'm not even going to lace up my boots for that shit any more.
Look at all those fat white 'Muricans complaining about their hardships at work! Just look at them!
shit jobs no one will do , and then treated like shit ,  greed greed greed ...OMG
If guinea pigs had their way, they'd be eating us...so it's US or THEM!
Guess who's against immigration
The way these companies exploit people is utterly disgraceful and needs to be stopped. They talk about their workers being valuable assets. Seems more like they mean disposable assets. It makes me so angry to see people being treated this way.
would the situation improve after this? Can't be hopeful :(
Imagine the guy that bought Zimmermans gun. Definitely a republican.
The section on Workers Compensation is spot on. Having been in the WC system for 22 years due to a serious back injury that left me with a 100% disability rating. I took "lifetime medical coverage" in place of money figuring the in the best case scenario the surgery and hardware would have problems. I was right, and now I have a hard time getting Acecidomidphen approved, even after taking opiates from 1998 - 2010. The insurance company has used the system to cut my treatment received since then and caused my having to go to the ER on several occasions due to withdrawal symptoms caused by the denial of medication (NO opiates, as they do not work on chronic nerve pain AND I got off the pills with the help of the doctor the insurance company told me I had to see more than 10 years ago) Now due to the doctor's treatment ideas and requests for authorization has caused the insurance company to "attack" their own for being truthful and documenting my conditions.  But I have see the erosion of the protection of the worker by doctors who are contracted to 'review' and either approve or deny the PRIMARY TREATING PHYSICIAN request. There is a greater than 90% denial rate in the first review and a greater than 95% denial rate for being upheald. The reviewer/s in my case, live in CA, have been in almost any state, but the insurance company has been using mostly doctors from Texas for the review. Now I know why...  Have a review from family medicine doctor, who, became a ER doctor, Chiropractor and addiction specialist, within a YEAR, decided that Acecidomidphen was not a first line treatment and denied the prescription. How is that possible??
John Oliver thank you
Mr. Oliver, can you make an episode on the MTA NYCT?
sick shit, welcome to America
Your news reporting does so much for the world. Thank you and your team for making a comedy news show into something so amazingly funny while still bettering the world.
Anyone else getting “The Jungle”  vibes by Upton Sinclair?  Any who, back to wondering if time is a flat circle.
Here’s John with the absolute clickbait again
They should've also covered Alaska Canneries. Same terrible issues, but has much higher rates of rape and sexual assault because managers don't do much about it and workers are effectively trapped in isolated areas of Alaska.
Any time an employer says, "Our workers are family," they're full of shit. They'll preach all about teamwork and family to their employees to a sickening, saccharine degree, while still treating them like shit.
I hope unions become more common again. Unionized workers would help solve a lot of the issues John just mentioned. The corporations are against because it will cost them, but screw them.
You said "Texans didn't choose [to loos their electric power]".  They did choose that.  They voted Republican.
I absolutely love John Oliver, I haven't laughed one single time during this season, and I hope that continue and that instead he continue to share political insight and criticism about society. It seems like USA really need a man like this.
I still brace for Adam Driver whenever there's I see a  reference coming.
Vegan World is on the way 💪🌱🥰🙌🔥
These mega meat packers are distinctly different from your local butcher! If you want to feel better about where and how your meat is sourced as well as enjoy better quality check em out.
"The owls are not what they seem"
Living in this country is so very disheartening. It doesn't feel like there is any hope unless you are wealthy.
Wanna hear a joke? John Oliver. Hahahahaha
go vegan or we all die
The corruption runs all the way to the top. Trump used executive war time powers to demand that the meat packing plants stay open despite them being covid hotspots. Who ghost wrote the orders? Why the meat packing industry itself https://www.propublica.org/article/emails-show-the-meatpacking-industry-drafted-an-executive-order-to-keep-plants-open
Once again he gets it wrong. First showing clustered workers claiming these conditions. I've been inside my local Cargill, while it was in production. Everyone was 6ft apart and there is temp testing before you are allowed in the gate. So no covid issues. Also while I was working there they didn't target those groups. I hate how if they didn't hire them you'd claim them racist but since they do it's predatory. Hypocrite. I bet their promotions are all white.... Nope. Most of them were minorities. Now onto workers comp. While I was there there was a gentleman on light duty from an injury.... his hourly rate....27 an hour, for watching their temp tent. And his medical bills were paid by the company on top of that. "It's nearly impossible to properly social distance on a line." I have worked security at 2 factories since covid started, this is blatantly false. And each plant have two usda workers that show up DAILY
At a place I once worked woman badly broke her arm on the job management wouldn't let her go to an emergency room they insisted she wait 2 weeks to see their factory doc. She couldn't wait because her arm at an odd angle in much pain so they fired her she sued took about 6 years.
The zippy team inherently spill because minute temporally hop through a various end. violet, present century
Why are these jobs not done by actual machines? It seems like it would be better for both the product and the employees.
We've known about the problems of this industry since the very early 1900s, and nothing has been done.
This reminded of a time that my 3rd grade class took a field trip to meat packaging plant. I don’t know what it was supposed to teach me but the stories that the employees taught me was horrifying.
I work in food distribution. Food is disgusting, y'all don't see like 80% of recalls lol
When are you doing an episode on India, RSS and the farmers protests?
The stuff on Texas Comp is sadly very accurate.  Few companies participate and you sign your rights away when your hired and confirm at each incident.  Small injuries are no big deal but bigger ones can be a nightmare to navigate.
It's worth noting that bribing politicians or the media didn't stop after chicken mogul with his cluckingham palace, it just changed, well bribing politicians changed, they can still buy off the media with ease. Buying politicians has changed though, you gotta have a lobbying group set up, and infer political donations to reelection campaigns and give small unassuming gifts in regular intervals that are under the required amount for them to legally declare, or simply buy it for their family members, or give it to their friends who will in turn give it to the politician as a gift from a friend and not as a politician...
Why is this trending?
I am watching his videos now for at least 1 month and i´ve got a question to all his viewers from the USA: What the hell is happening with and in your country?! WTF?
Christmas presents aren't usually bribes, UNLESS you're the child of a divorce.   Lol
Man they should have all the "stretching" employees stretch on over to the warehouse for a shift or two...how insane are these companies?.......
Careful Oliver. If I didn't know better I'd think you were talking about WORKER'S RIGHTS, and that is dangerous.   The US already gave their slaves rights once. Was that not enough?
Think Upton Sinclair's novel, "The Jungle," it isn't much better today.
PUT THIS ON MAINSTREAM TV
Meatpacking... Sounds like a  80s porno
The one thing that bugged me was an about the 5:40 mark during that segment at that West Michigan news Station about the workers in the diapers that one I guess she was Asian woman seemed a little too cheerful talking about the story at least make it seem like you have some type of empathy in your voice instead of looking like you could crack up at any moment.
How fucking corrupt is america?
That's why they  don't like  union what's wrong with tx
8:56: In India its called "iodex maliye,kaam pe chaliye".
For a while my hometown had the highest Covid rate in the country because of our meat packing plant, it only has a population of 55,000 but the plant employed anywhere from 3,000to 4,000 people. It didn’t take long before it’s swept a crossed mostly the lower income half of the population.   the conditions in these plants are not good, if I was in a position of power I would say the United States should nationalize the meatpacking plants give them to the local communities to run as co-ops because this would both improve health and employment standards while also eliminating the monopolistic practices of these companies.
It would be a good idea to revisit Assisted Living Center conditions again. My 98 year old grandmother lives at an ALC in Coppell, TX. During the recent winter storm, the center was without power for more than 5 days because the center had fired the handyman, and no one at the facility knew how to start the generator. My wife finally called the Coppell Fire Department, who sent the Fire Marshall. The generator was non-functional due to lack of maintenance, so the Fire Marshall cited the facility, and ordered, and assisted, the Center to obtain a new generator. We are very grateful to the Coppell Fire Department, but the Assisted Living Center should have never gotten to this point.
I was living in Cedar Falls, IA (right next to Waterloo, for those not from here) right around the time the stuff about Tyson came out. So many people were horrified.
Does anyone have links to good petitions, talking points, anything like that?
Exploitation to the fullest! Bloody disgusting!
Feck these industries go vegan
Get a laugh track, I’m sitting at home hitting a laugh track button to simulate it
The Jungle 2.0
I’m surprised that this video didn’t even mention the psychological toll this industry takes on its workers. Slaughterhouse work has been linked to higher rates of PTSD, drug abuse, and domestic violence. Also, I get that this is a video focused on a particular issue, but I disagree when John says that the animal abuse is already talked about a lot. I can’t believe how little such a horrendous and ubiquitous practice is discussed.
"I aimed at the public's heart and by accident I hit it in the stomach." -Upton Sinclair
Grow your own food or support a local farmer
Everyone is missing the point. Everything in this story is not unique to meat packing. It’s universal to corporations.   The meat aspect just makes it more disgusting.
This is how almost ALL companies treat their employees, especially in big production line work: like replaceable automatons. Amazon does it, and is arguably the leader at it, as well as many other industries.   We live in an age where we can automate SO MUCH. We could easily automate these jobs, and then if we had a functional government, tax the owners of said automation, and provide a UBI so that the people who can't get work through no fault of their own, due to automation, they won't have to starve or be homeless.  Automation is inevitable, we need to stop fighting against it with this bullshit idea that "full employment is the sign of a healthy economy", because it's demonstrably not, and turning people into meat robot wage slaves is no way to fucking live.
It's sad but I have to admit that over here in Germany things aren't really better in that industry, although they use other means to circumvent our labour protection laws. My conclusion: Im eating much less meat, and when I do, I buy it from local sources. It's 3-4 times more expensive, but when you reduce your meat consumption from daily to 2 times a week it's manageable.
Those people working these kind of jobs that are more like torture deserve every nickel they get. I am thankful they do it.🤔
Bruh why is he trying sooo hard with these jokes.... they're so forced..
Do a report on how Biden signed an executive order greatly increasing federal funding for private, for profit, prisons.
The more I learn about meat, the more disgusting it gets....
Capitalism. F yeah.
West indie pirates had better worker's comp than these lads and that was 300 hundred years ago

I highly recommend reading “Fast Food Nation”. It is extremely informative.  Loved the episode as always!
Anyone know any good charities or anything I could donate to, in order to push against this?
Hey John, this is great information about the Texas emergency, and also about the meat industry issues. But this video got CUT off in the middle of the Texas Presentation, So I think we missed out on part of your talk!
Judi Dench IS a f*cking treasure!
Yeah, I had a cousin who worked for a meatpacking plant... and she almost went back to using drugs to function. Her oldest son committed suicide when he was a key player on the football team. She's not an immigrant or a former convict. She was close to that line by falling into the drug use and the 10-year clean sobriety was good for a long time. She struggled the most after her son died... and she was given a few days to grieve before going back to work.
I’m more interested in fudge packing personally, but this might be interesting
If i had to choose a my favorite part of these videos it would be  when john reacts with 'holy shit' to the news soundbite.
Shout outs to Iowa being in the News, sadly never for anything good😅😩
John is doing the best and most relevant topics ever this year.        I am sick of politics from last year.
I'm tired of this. Tired of stories about corporate negligence with no repercussions.
So, we're arguing that during the time we had meat shortages and everyone was pannicky, that companies should have shut down and implemented safety standards (which would slow production even after the plants reopen). Also, we're claiming that opening a factory in a place where there is a large population of unemployed people is diabolical.
Propaganda with comedy as the  tool. Is this a comedy act pushing frankenfood? Bill Gates is pushing some type of meat replacement made out of mold or moss or some type of crap. I wonder how much money and where it's coming from that is being pumped into idiotic not so funny comedy shows like this?
Wait I'm confused... how can a blank check be $10,000
Me and other 50% of the people from another country,   Will we watch John talk about something specific only to the USA  Yes we will of course we will  Why, I'll tell you why because it's John Oliver goddamnit
I’ve worked for Harris ranch for a year and a half I can tell you that this is completely true. Freaking dehumanizing.
Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the kingdom of Heaven is near. Matthew 3:2  Jesus loves you♥️ Never give up on your life!!
Upton Sinclair just out here like "I TOLD YOU A CENTURY AGO. A CENTURY"
Very entertaining.
If there’s one thing I’ve learned in life, it’s this: Any business/company that refers to their employees as their “family” have terrible working conditions and everyone hates it there.
That guinea pig must be a relative of the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog..
Basically all of John's videoes makes me happy im not living in the US, lol.
This segment has left me with an insatiable appetite for the rich (yet again).
0:33 That little girl is dressed like Wario.
I’m getting flashbacks to when I peed my pants in like the third grade cause the teacher wouldn’t let me go... what is this?
Easy fix for this. Stop eating meat.
Same shit goes on here in Germany. Dickheads remain dickheads, no matter where they are...
I would wear a diaper and take no breaks for $1000 an hour....lol
Is this a DNC Donation Ad?  Are Catholic Charities going to send folks down south to help MS13 in child requisitions?  Meat is getting scarce but hey, look out Mexico, your children are in high demand, Rainbow Stew, a Marxist Fav....
good on you guys for this.
The 1k dislikes are the owners of a meat packing company and their “family”
Damn , that is it. I’ll start buying from my local butcher like I should have done it years ago.
Thats it im switching to seitan
iowan here, our governor does not care about our coronavirus numbers and has even lifted mask mandates while iowa has some of the highest covid-19 numbers in the country
I'm srill watching the episode but even as one who eats meat, it's a little odd to have talked about last week lowering meat consumption and now we're talking about meat production workers and their working conditions...seems a bit counter-intuitive, lol.  Also, I feel there are better issues to discuss back in the realm of politics. This all feels very "softball", like "Yep, Biden made it in, everything's great now!" I'm Democrat, but I still want the same scrutiny given to Biden to keep a laser-focused eye on him and his work. He has a very low threshold to cross in comparison to being better than Trump and I'm happy he's already done a lot, but again, that's bare minimim for a president. Also, I figured January 6th would've been the absolute first thing they covered when they got back from break and it kind of irks me that it wasn't, like it's being brushed away.
My mom used to work as a nurse at a meat processing plant and she couldn't count the number of injuries she had to deal with.
I'm not impressed, Mr. Oliver. No mention of Upton Sinclair's "Jungle"? No research on how the meat packing industry since the early 1980's have been one of, if not THE no.1 union busting industries in the USA? No research into how packing house were some of the first industries to benefit from employees forming union shops in the 1930's and 40's? No mention of how Iowa Beef Processers(IBP), now part of Tyson was the leader in union busting and leading the race to the bottom for working conditions in the Packing Houses? Talk to anyone who lives in a Midwest city or town where a packing house is or was and they will tell you of how up until the early 1980's the jobs in the Packinghouse was tough, but they paid GOOD WAGES and the towns prospered. Did you know that IBP was the first to slash wages and recruit illegal immigrants into the industry?    How about how the consolidation in the industry has decimated not only working conditions and PAY and BENNIFITS for employees, but has affected farmers and their ability to market livestock? Or how the communities that the packing houses are in have become some of the cities with large drug problems, and social services that are overloaded by the freeloading Packing Cos.(Corporate Welfare).   I grew up with many of my friends fathers working in Packing houses and know people that have done it. It is hard work that has gotten worse since the unions have been neutered and the pay scale is now horrible.   I'm sorry, but this story is old news, at least 30+ years old.
Message received: Go vegan for the human animal.
I hated being a safety worker at a factory.  You are blamed by the employees for poor working conditions and you aren't given the power to fix any of them. You can fix malfunctions and report injuries but you can't change their system, which is the root problem. First the rate of production needs to be lower to allow bathroom breaks and reduce injury. Second they need some exceptions to their attendance policy. It's a very cut and dry system. If you have a medical condition that kept you from work that wasn't work related, you're fired. It should be like school, you get a doctor's note then it's excused.
🙁

Hit them where it hurts. Go Vegetarian.
Hello "The Jungle"
Yikes... as an Ecuadorian occupational Doctor ( my specialty is in safety and work medicine) it’s appalling, weird that OSHA doesn’t have enough power. In Ecuador our ministry of health will give your company a fine and then check again if you haven’t change it fine again ( you get like 4 chances and then they close you). Really sad
Wait... after ALL that's happened since you've been off-air. THIS is what you focus on? THIS?
Clearly the down votes come from the meat packing industry executives
Wait, y'all elected trump? who needed convincing that shit was FUCKED UP over there?
FIsh packing plants are even worse. CHeck out the one in Whittier Alaska.
Wow, Tyson chicken setting up what looks to be Deadpools to bet on the number that will test positive, and perhaps the number of employees that will die. This coming from a company who treats employees like family, how shocking. Never would have guessed that from a corporation, not. Employees are expendable and can be replaced, but less employees means less profit given out as expenditures for paying wages. I'm surprised at this point, they're just not using robots.
If you've read "The Jungle," you can skip this (as I did at 4:02 in case he references it later).
You poor people.  You think anything is actually going to change?  Nothing changes, it just changes names.
I love you daddy Johnny
I always find a company saying "we're like family here" so crazy. Like you probably fired a person the previous week without much warning. You're a business who uses the family motto to give yourselves leverage to ask more from your workers.
The radium girls got a better settlement. How do they figure the value of people's lives!?!
John Oliver is a meat packer.
When a business says "we're like a family" they mean they make my mom look like Mother Teresa? OMG.
*sees meat packing in the title*   *has flashbacks to the Jungle by Upton Sinclair*     Fuck my ass is it 1906 again?
John this isnt about sex at all.  With a name like meat packing im disappointed
This has been going on for over a century. That's why we had muckrakers in the early 20th century who were exposing the same type of conditions in factories. It's a damn shame, but at least the information is out there.
Where is OSHA or Department of Labor?
Thank you very much for the entertainment. Luckily these things will never change...
My aunt worked at a Tyson plant. I am not shocked.
Problem with this, is the companies will eventually find actual machines and not human " machines and all those people will be out of work.
Welp, it's clear that capitalism has failed the average man. The whole thing must be uprooted.
Glad to have you back John. I know this is week 2 but still. The world needs you
Where in the f*** is OSHA!?
This is horrific and not to toot my own horn but I stopped eating beef, chicken and pork. Just seafood, plant based, and gluten free foods, but for the company to treat their workers this way is just really wrong and they should be held accountable. People in this line of work should be treated with respect and dignity. This made me so livid!
About fucking time you are back!!!🤣🤣🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
I work for a food distributor and i loathe the fact that I’m in the business of supporting this goddamn industry — fuck this garbage, I need to fucking quit 😔
Well at least they tested for covid. My company refused to test, contact trace, and just started seriously requiring masks two weeks ago after Bidens federal mandate.
Considering I’ve found a pair of goggles in a bag of chicken breast one night I’m not surprised at all by this stuff.
Want to fix that? Easy: Unconditional basic income, enough for shelter, food and basic needs. The only reason why this is possible is because people are forced into this to satisfy those three needs. Oh and shut up about "I don't want to pay lazy bums with my taxes". Just ask yourself would you stop working? There is your answer. Also you get the money too and it will do wonders for the economy.
"The Jungle," an expose of the meat packing industry, including the exploitation of immigrants, was written by Upton Sinclair in 1906.  It aroused outrage at the time, and it is definitely still relevant today.  Everyone should read it.  Some of the details are probably not accurate now, partly due to technology and the shift of ethnicity of the immigrants, but read it.  It's an eye-opener.
wow, I'm actually surprised that there's not an episode about the Capitol Riots yet.
I love how calmly he says “moving on”
John - this is the country you choose to live in! All the best from Europe!
Employee at home that night right before bed: “I made that guy who had both hands crushed sign that form with his teeth!  OH, MY GOD! WHAT DID I DO!”
They could reduce knife injuries if they choked their chickens.
It is terrifying how US treats its people, how striking those differences between social classes are, that preying upon vulnerable... with every episode, I am just happier and happier that I do not live in US
wow i thought it sucks in other countries when your poor but america is just as bad as everywhere else. Sigh. This might be a people (rich people in my opinion) problem as oppose to country problem.
Chances are, almost everyone watching this in America supports this industry, and these exact factories.  Maybe stop buying meat from these inhuman fk's.
This show would be that much better if they followed up the depressing reality of the US's fucked up systems with possible solutions. People need solidarity and need to feel like it's not hopeless
We have to explain this when talking about animal welfare in places like this. There's no point in being angry at a worker for causing those animals pain and suffering, if that worker in under these conditions. Thats why its a pointless battle to try chaging the way the animals are treated if you dont help the welbeing of the workers
Thank you, these people all deserve better rights. Stopping the sale would put them out of work and just piss off the corperation. They need to be represented and changes made.
how much did the typon pool pay?
If I remember correctly didn't trup sign an order saying they could increase the line speed more
Very reminiscent of Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle" from 1906.
In India we don't do that.
I had adopted the phrase “a cut above but the rest” as a personal motto, but I always knew I had heard it somewhere else, Imagine my surprise upon finding out, it’s the fucking Tyson slogan
So what can we do? There is no way I'm giving up meat.
Go plant-based and save lives!
Can you end America please.
I think the saddest thing about this is how weak OSHA has become. I remember I was a teenager volunteering at a library more than a decade ago and we were told about our OSHA rights and how seriously they are taken at the library. I was just a volunteer stacking books but the library took OSHA seriously. Now it seems like OSHA is an afterthought. This whole thing could be resolved if OSHA was given back it's strength.
Happy to be a pescatarian after watching this.
pretty much all of this also applies to Amazon Warehouses. yes, including the blood, unrine, and feces...but in a slightly different context.
I love this show but I'm getting sick of the half-ass solutions proppsed. It's always pointint to huge companies and telling them to change. They work a certain way bc it's what gives them profits. How about we as consumers take responsability and stop supporting them by buying their products?????
Is it the manager's faults? Working conditions run downhill.  They probably recognized the risk but couldn't do anything about it because the rules came from above.  Seems like anger being pointed at the wrong people.
This makes me never want to never eat meat or chicken again. 😳😳😳
Humans will never understand. We have a worldwide virus that stems from mistreatment of animals. I could care less about the people stop over producing and abusing animals.
USA rapidly descending to become an undevolep country
Robot Chicken is not good. I am good. My Name is Brian A Koller
I must admit, that as a non USAsian, I find it at times ironic how ppl there talk about the governments of China and Russia controlling the citizens view of their country.  Surely they do, but the image of people shouting USA while trying to topple the USA speaks in volumes. The "America number one" indoctrination runs deep, and most I'd bet don't believe that USA is behind in many vital measures of well-being compared to most other western democratic, usually social democratic countries.  Like Finland where I am from. Not my place to be proud of my ancestors and the fact that Finland is how it is, and by no means even close to perfect. Closer to selling out... Also no country survives by itself, Finland (nor USA) can't exist separated from the rest, so I can only try to be proud of my own actions. Not praise my country without mind, but to question and criticize it even, for we are not ready humans in a ready world, but need to develop. And diversity is one key thing, as is education, creativity.. Not owning, so we have no money to act by our said values.
#GoVegan bitches!!!!
Recently had a manager ask me to excuse myself for calling a customer a customer instead of “family”  that same night after I got cut to go home, I went to help a coworker in the store since his dish partner left him solo and working that area by yourself sucks ass. Since I used to work in his position I know the pain.  Long story short, that night, the same manager who told me were “family” told me I was REQUIRED to stay and help close since I decided to help this guy  and didn’t leave right away. Family is Bs work propaganda don’t fall for it.
You can take this *entire video* and copy and paste it on basically ever other manufacturing job in America.
I stopped eating meat last April because of this sh*t.  The only exception was a chicken I bought--at a farmer's market, directly from the woman who had raised it--for my private Thanksgiving feast.  It was $25, but it was delicious, and maybe we should accept that that's a fair price for an ethically raised chicken.
Our very own Upton! Keep releasing the jungle
Me: Oh yay, a new john Oliver! Me, 19 minutes later: god i'm depressed.
Strong 3rd world vibes
What do you mean John? The US is the wealthiest, greatest, freest country ever in the word! Right?
Don’t give these companies your money #govegan. Bonus is no one dies for your meal ;)
Capitalism. Deregulation. It’s all good until you put greedy humans in charge who care more about their pockets than anyone else. Capitalism needs regulations.
If you want a long-term solution, regulation ain't it. Regulation will just get rolled back as soon as a particularly bribable politician gets elected. A long term solution involves strikes, boycotts, unions - direct collective action. Really, we should just abolish capitalism altogether, but let's take things one step at a time.
I worked at a meat packing plant here in PA and I got sexually harassed so bad to the point where it made me quit. At the time I was only like 19 and didn't know I was able to speak up and possibly get them in trouble for it. This was 2010 I believe I don't even think it would hold up in court by this point.
Take a look at FedEx. You will find similar problems
La muerte peluda
Jbs jbs 🥲
Wait..... you mean to tell me that a low level non skilled job sucks!?!?!? No way!!!
lil muckraker
At least he's not talking about problems in the white house anymore, and finally tackling problems that have existed before the big orange
Soylent green is people, i wonder how long till it's Perdue, Tyson or the others?
Back when I was in high school I worked for a local restaurant that bribed health inspectors in order to stay open and they used to buy up all the liquor licenses in the city to avoid competition.
fucking money...
When he said he's meat to any animal above him on the food chain I thought he was going to mention Adam driver🤣🤣🤣🤣
The title of the episode doesn't do justice to the importance of the information put out in this episode,  something must be done.  Ps. Another one Jhon *claps*
992 meat packing workers did not like this video.
They're not gaming the system, it's how the system is designed to work sir. From the establishment of this country, it's been about extracting resources from the environment using people as tools to do so. The preamble was describing a small segment of persons, from Jefferson's point of veiw.
Mmmmmmm 🍖
That's why I support automation
He said that’s the way he feels. Feelings are not facts
When he said nobody should be treated like a machine, I expected an inappropriate Adam Driver Joke. I was disappointed. The Covid Life is getting to you John.
After reading Fast Food Nation and learning about the horrors in different meat packing factories like T*s*n where people lost limbs, this became a topic I think about daily, blue collar jobs and such deserve better regulations so that worker’s safety and rights are erased, that 44 year old man could be someones father, but even if he wasn’t he still deserves rights
Trump's not in office any more which way, liberal left?
Go vegan and stop all this insanity.
How this country is not classified as a third world country is beyond me.
Capitalism 1.0
"Blank $10,000 check" uhhh.... what?
In the land of the free everyone eating industrial meat is part of the problem. Why? Because we like the cheap buckets of chicken. Only worker Unions in these factory will alleviate some of the problems. Greed is Good.
Jon Oliver calling out a perverted owl = game recognizing game.....?
I love that the biggest city near me being the cite of all this
I can only imagine that vegan activists are upset that he didn't even mention the possibility that everyone give up eating meat so there would be no need for meatpacking plants.
I can't understand how that even possible in development country, I'm from third world country and this never happened and we have alot of stupidity but that's so evil
Ah poor working conditions, the actual point that Upton Sinclair was trying to make in “The Jungle”...
I live in a town near that plant in Colorado. That plant alone accounted for a considerable amount of the percentage of covid cases in the county (I forget the exact number, but it was at least 10%) at the start of the pandemic.
That first ad was already so upsetting and then it only got worse from there
We treat our employees like family. And my family doesn't insist on being payed when they do something for me. Welcome to the family, Jim.
We all hate that people act like that, and you will all die Fast with people like that in USA:(
WZZM 13 in Grand Rapids Michigan is a great news channel, they have always done great nationwide and local coverage!!
I love LWT, and this episode was well done, as always. But I can’t help but feel disappointed that they’ve covered the meat industry twice (Chickens - May 18, 2015) and breezed past talking about the animals both times. The actual subjects were worth covering, but so is the the underlying cruelty of factory farming and meat packing. I disagree with the notion that animal conditions have been covered “a lot” by mainstream outlets, and regardless, I think a show like LWT covering the issue would be impactful. Of course, it’s easier to focus on working conditions and industry corruption since the onus to make change is on the government/regulators, whereas questioning the ethics of eating meat altogether is something that would be relevant to most of John’s audience.
Anyone else thinking about Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle? Things really haven’t changed since he wrote it
Capitalism KILLS
OSHA and USDA can't just do things on their own, they need to follow the Code of Federal Regulations, which are rules set by politicians.  So, complain to your government representatives, they're the ones that do this.
Robot fuck a soup!!! LMFAO!!!
Iowa is a disaster in a whole, they only care about money and not the life of any human
Hannibal lecter and Jack the ripper would be proud of those employees
The acceptable margaret electrophysiologically haunt because cell peroperatively ruin above a glamorous population. able, boiling engine
You live in America John, we're gonna put Betty White on that list
That one chapter “Kenny” from Fast Food Nation
I am surprised he didn't mention the plant in GA that had multiple violations they would not resolve then had a liquid nitrogen leak that killed 6 people, they do not care about employees they can replace them in 15 mins take care of your selves and your families because your company does not care about you one bit.
If Tyson and its workers are a family, it's mine
When Upton Sinclair wrote on the horrors of unsanitary food plants in the US, it the initial goal wasn't to tell you what was in your food; it was to show you how bad the workers had it.
I worked for one of those companies I had a workers comp claim in was sent to drs was given the run around for 9 months my surgery was put on hold went to my own doctor for a check up which didn't involve my workmen's comp claim he examined my hands and said I needed surgery right away had the surgery and was fired because I went to my own doctor
What do we keep learning here? Warehouse work needs heavy regulation. OSHA needs to go down and inspect every plant weekly without announcing their arrival. And penalties need to be harsher.
All of these nightmares the result of right wing conservatism. Fact.
Stop giving corporations equal or greater rights than citizens.  Among other things, that only gives the individuals who run them more than their "one vote one voice" power.
This is what happens when you don't go to college. All those people that went to college got good paying corporate jobs.
Go vegan boiz
John failed to mention one way to stop this horror, avoid eating meat.
There's was a 50 percent positivity rate at tysons. The plastic barriers just get covered in meat particles and they can't sanatize it addiquately
Becoming Vegetarian now has human benefits and not just animal benefits.
Has there been an episode criticizing Biden and Harris?
Always be BEWARE of working for companies that define themselves as being a family.
Stuff like this makes me eat less meat
When ppl boycotted and strike an employer, they helped each other with meals and shelter, group together and helped one another. with a lot of their workers being immigrants and the country hating immigrants, they wont get the help they need to strike to get safe work conditions. These companies benefit so much from common hatred and perpetrating all of it. if ppl were the Christians they said they were. they would help in these cases. they would do what they would for a fellow church goer who lost a spouse. Don't do mission trips to Brazil, do one here. have ppl help these workers get the compensation they deserve. even a go fund a meat packing worker so they can leave that job and boycot the food company is a great start. We all really need to get behind one thing at a time. if we can get them to all strike for even a week and boycott for a week from buying, their pockets would feel it!
This is what happens when you deregulate agrarian sector! #supportfarmers
You don't have to be vegetarian but "meat reduced" is still a good way to go. Help change the laws, eat less meat, fuck corporations
If you look close enough, you can almost see the hand up his ass puppet-erring him.
It's incredible and telling how unfunny you and the show are when you don't have a manipulative audience being told to laugh at all the shitty jokes every 3 seconds.
Why is meat packing not done by robots?
11:15 that makes sense, owls are some of the most voyeuristic birds in general
Picking up where Upton Sinclair left off
Why do you think politicians want open borders? Cheap labor that will vote how they are told. I would be surprised if it didn't happen.
My grandmother, 2 cousins, and aunt work at the JBS Greeley plant and let me tell you they DO NOT give a fuck about those workers
Pra quem for brasileiro, ou lusófono, procure o documentário "Carne Osso".
can we admit we never abolished slavery we just changed the wording and are greatful when we find a master willing to keep us?
i want to know more about that betting pool. was the gaffer doing it to prove a point, betting that conditions weren't safe enough so the company would agree to improvements? you've told me nothing
3:03 woah
All hail america. *the new china*
Capitalism at its finest.
And of course nothing is going to be done because this is America. The only thing we care about is money.
that commercial 😂
I know this is a broken record: But once again the problem is solved by the workers seizing the means of production.
"robot-f@ck a soup" 😅🤪🤣
Thanks capitalism
There's so many reasons to go vegetarian/vegan. Not just for workers and animals. The meat industry, especially beef/dairy, are MAJOR contributors to the climate crisis. We're seeing just the beginning of tragic catastrophic consequences. WTF has to happen for us to WAKE UP and stop destroying the planet. We have no plan B. Mars is not clearly habitable.
Thank fuck Trump is out of office now so that John can continue to do actual Journalism and reporting rather than obsess over the Big Bad Orange Man.
Welcome to the retail pharmacy
My day job is for a company processing FMLA and Disability claims for Tyson workers. If you have any doubts about the number of cases: I'm here to tell you we ran mandatory overtime throughout the pandemic just to keep up with them. Horrifying.
I noticed that he didn't want to mention the problem of ILLEGAL immigrants (simply referred to all as "immigrants").  Sorry, but words matter.  This problem is exacerbated by the presence of illegals and both sides are to blame.  Liberals think enforcing borders is cruel and conservatives love having a source of cheap labor for America's corporations.  So it's a win-win for both parties and a lose-lose for the country.  Not only are illegals suffering, but also so is American labor by being forced to compete with cheap workers.
What a shitty country, proof that capitalism is just bad in everything...
Sorry but my phone is not ranked higher than my family. Always family first who raised you.
Is this Capitalism, or just Desire for cheap food?
Nothing has changed in the last 100 years. For those who are skeptic, you should read The Jungle by Upton Sinclair.
I love this show, but I wish he would say more about what we can do right now to help the situation.
Thanks for sharing these on youtube, Jon. Er, Jhon. Crap....
The food industry wants us sick.
Who pitched that guinea pig commercial, and how much PCP had they done just prior to it???
My uncle and grandpa simp for capitalism and hate regulation. They roll their eyes when I point out corporate corruption like this affects real people in horrid ways. If these companies are left unchecked, quality of life is absolutely dismal for those who work there.
I worked at a cargill plant many years ago. There is nothing "family" there.
In all honesty I didn’t watch this video because I can’t deal with him anymore after the years of just straight up whining ab trump. I get that’s his politics but he just made it feel so one sided and he made everything ab trump that it was exhausting and boring. I might watch this later but I am happy to see a return of non anti trump episodes I think the shown will be better for it.
Like how many more reasons do we need to give up meat?
Man, has this industry changed. I worked a year at a family owned meat packing plant in Michigan to make money for school. The work was not easy even in 1982, but they treated us pretty well and paid pretty well. We got regular breaks, and when I did start developing a repetitive stress injury, they sent me to a doctor and moved me to a different, less physically strenuous job. And we never crammed workers together on the lines. JBS owns them now, and in 1994, there was an indictment - they had brought in a new human resources person - a Mexican immigrant, who had connections to bring in illegal workers, and provide them false documents, so the company could save money on pay and rising cost of benefits - which the illegals did not get, of course.
Hey John Oliver, maybe do an episode on the horrific conditions animals face in factory farms? Because it's actually NOT spoken about a lot - especially when you take into account the number of societal issues it connects. Public health and preventable chronic lifestyle diseases, water quality and supply, greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, infectious zoonotic disease risk - and of course animal welfare. Its actually not spoken about much at all. You have a unique platform, this is a big issue.
OMG.  This really is totally messed up.  I really wish the companies will begin to do much better,  for their value workers.  Super disheartening.
Tyson investing in the health of thier corporate office workers and not their factory workers...  Sounds about white...
THIS IS AMERICA. It's who corporations want us to be. And they are the ones most of the government cares about.
I work at a beef slaughter house in Wisconsin. And have worked for jbs before. The attitude is basically if u don't want to work we can easily replace you there is always people who need work. Injuries get the ibuprofen treatment or suck it up treatment all the time. It's a sucky place to work but it's good money and plenty of overtime. So alot of us are stuck there
Me: wonder if liberal owl will talk as much shit on creepy joe biden as much as he did trump.   Also me: not holding me breath cause we all know dementia joe can do no wrong.
Yes please 😂
There should be a law where every CEO should be forced to once a month perform a random shift of his workers. Just to keep things in perspective.
LOL conspiracy theorist called it.  Attacking meat is happening everyday.
The American Agricultural industrial complex is a murderous top-down cartel that infiltrated the government to rig it in their favor. They trade human beings like currency.
All those office workers doing the exercise and meditation are porkers that no amount of exercise and meditation will do anything about, so long as they keep stuffing down their gullets the toxic, chemical dead animal poison that they do every day.
WHAT THE FUCK IS FDA DOING?
I'm sorry are you telling me that, upon ending of a homicide case, they returned the weapon to the assailant?
I'm so glad John Oliver finally brought up Worker's Comp, shit's so broken
Why your last 2 videos are blocked in Italy. Not from there but were picking Italy in the VPN.
The outcry over these severe working conditions seems completely negligible compared to so-called celebrity scandals. Can we please direct the mob towards putting pressure on law makers to save lives and improve living conditions for our essential workers, away from things like Chris Pratt being Christian or AOC wearing a nice outfit?
Anyone who consumes meat is part of the problem. The consumers want more meat? Obviously the industry wants to provide you with these products so they can make money. But if you quit eating meat or at least reduce your consumption you make life for everyone including the animals and the planet a lot better.
Every place I worked at that claimed the staff was "like family", it usually meant they were perfectly okay being abusive, asking for way too much, and trying to make you feel bad for not destroying your mind and body on the job.
5;11 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
As a meat company employee. I can tell you that there is no 6ft apart. We basically go to work with an understanding that ,chances are we are going to get sick. Only piece of mind I get from my job is that at least people are going to have food in their grocery stores,and hopefully not go hungry.
Plant closes due to rampant Covid   Employee at that plant dies of Covid simultaneously  JBS: covid wasn't work related
America, I give in.  Social libaralism is clearly the inferior model for society - I wish we, here in Scandinavia, had YOUR GREAT working environment, fostered by rampant capitalistic greed. Man I hate living in a civilized country - I would much rather move to America.

15:03 "What's in the box?"
I always thought when he made fun of a product it was hilarious. When he said immersion blender I noticed. Wait... have they just been advertisements this whole time?!
I gotta go Vegetarian...
0:34 This looks like the deadly rabbit from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
Be careful John. You keep up this anti-American sentiment, and you may end up in an unfortunate accident.  - CIA (probably)
Seize the means
Guess i have to tell my mom to change chicken nuggets 😂
Capitalism needs to die. Seriously.
Amazing how many here are simply parroting Oliver.  Its also amazing that people cant seem to see that the elite are wanting to phase out meat for the lowly masses, and Oliver couldnt wait to jump on that bandwagon. People need to wake up before all youre eating is crickets and grub worms.
Yeah, wasn't a big fan of these large plants to begin with due to their treatment of farmers, but I guess this is just another thing to add on top!
I have been involved in the Safety industry for years for the United Steelworkers and unfortunately OSHA is based on politics. When the republicans win OSHA goes to shit.
Yay capitalism 😒
ok upton sinclair
I’m getting strong Lil Gideon vibes from Bo Pilgrim.
We need another Teddy Roosevelt.
I guess I'm in the minority that doesn't think the covid betting pool is that big of a deal
4:47 I remember watching this exact segment........disgusting.
What kind of family you are matters
I guess these corporate heads call it 'family' because it is incestuous to them from sodomizing hourly workers.
I am only gonna buy from union butcher now.
As if there needed to be another reason to not eat meat but the industry needs reform regardless. so sad
So that's what veganism is about, huh 🤔
Just another reason to give up meat, dairy, eggs, and animal products. There isn’t a quick and easy solution to this problem governmentally, but you as a consumer can choose to stop giving them money. As long as we inflict this violence on animals, we’re going to inflict it on each other as well.
10:48 Dont judge a book by its cover but somehow it’s so easy to tell that someone is a crook.
Everyone is aghast at these conditions; as they sit down to met in every single thing they eat.  #goveg
Some advice: don't listen to this late at night right after listening to the Magnus Archives episode about a meat packing plant.  Not good
Rather than riot on the streets be smart and strategic: If somebody (who is supposed to provide you real treatment) offers bengay, arrange to have their knee caps turns to mush on the DL.  If somebody runs a plant that exploits its general workforce, do the same but also to his elbows. If somebody claims to run an giant megacorp based around valuing its employees, but values the product they sell more, arrange for the above on a weekly basis.   They'll get the message eventually.  I should note that Upton Sinclair's The Jungle sought to expose the atrocious work conditions and treatment of meat products (before/after/during processing), it supposedly helped to bring about real change; but considering the exploitative efforts of mega warehouses and places like Amazon, Walmart etc, it also isn't super surprising that a POS human would attempt to do this.
Great post, John. I mean they always are, but great work. Please, please, please never stop. Love from a fellow Brit (loved your work in Green Wing, Dude!). Namaste.
Who else eates BAKED BEANS and raises awareness about topics that are shaded in an entertainingly inellectual way, and also comes up with solutions.   The greatest zazu! JO
Upton Sinclair is rolling in his grave like "damn this shit STILL going on?!"
Wow, I thought cruelty to our food animals was bad, but cruelty to the workers just shows the psychopathy of the management of these corrupt corporations
Good thing I'm vegan... Now I'm vegan for the people too, not just the animals.
Ah, a fresh air of capitalism at its finest.
That waiver while you're injured should be considered coercion. You've just crushed both hands and you aren't in the right head space to think about things like that.
Two pro-vegan episodes in two weeks
This is one of the reasons I went vegan
Sometimes, your stories are not funny. But it's the F**kin Truth. This is one case. "President Trump. Two words that should never go together. Like Walrus Porn, or Tilda Swinton"
Tyson corporate big shots need those work outs to shed all that evil gluttony they are addicted to...
I could tell you some horror stories. I’ll never forget working 7 days straight and being told not to complain because if we didn’t complain we might be able to get out halfway through day 7. Also, a cleaning man falling into a vat that began to entangle and kill him and the management saying they were on break and have another manager go help save his life.
Yeah...another reason not eat meat. .who are wants to support the hisv exploitation?
people predicted most of these developments in the run up to the 1980 Presidential election where trickle down economics was first talked about. yes the recession in 1978/1979 led us in a direction that is still continuing us on the wrong path . The widening wage gap , the shrinking economic power of the middle class , the ever widening economic divide are all  a direct consequence of that racist and disgusting policy
Did I miss John saying the word unionize?  Yes, these companies need to be held accountable, but they also are pretty agile at preventing workers unions.   That shit with Tyson is definitely disgusting; Iowans know and still buy their products.  I feel so lucky to be able to but directly from small farmers in Iowa; I’m hoping this opportunity grows.  It tends to be the same as heading to the grocery store since the Kidman is eliminated.
This is the kind of thing that should make the USA realize they are not a "1st world country".
same here in Germany
This some ida tarbell shit
We Democrats install solid regulatory bodies, that are necessary to protect us from Shortcuts. Then Republicans come along and use those same regulations to bludgeon small companies out of existence. Then claim it was the regulation’s fault! Lol. Republicans are responsible for all of this!
Sadguru
Milk turns guinea pigs into ravenous killers, lol.
Lucky owl.......
The Jungle  by Upton Sinclair was first published in 1905.  We need to keep businesses under better scrutiny
3:00 actually....... *FAMILY; NOT FRIENDS* .... cmon we all do bad things to them, because we can!
England has a killer bunny, and America it's killer guinea pig ...
Well, that explains the ammonia taste.  10:00 - A Blank $10,000 check? Shouldn't the amount be blank, and the signature "Your Biggest Clucking Fan"?  Though I'm pretty sure if you signed a waiver such as that you'd still have a pretty good fight in court on the basis that you were coerced into signing it. That takes money though.  It really sounds like not fucking much has changed since Upton Sinclair's The Jungle.
2:04 - As a food delivery driver, I know of at least two Asian restaurants that have very young children (but family members), as young as nine years old serving the food for the family restaurant. Perfectly legal in Wisconsin. So yeah, to some, family can be assets.
We live in a failed state, folks.
I guess 932 people really liked Pilgrim's painting of the fucking pheasants.
I miss thee old YouTube logo
The teeth of OSHA really gotta be sharpened.
It's so depressing that this shit is still a problem. My husband lost his job a year ago and is now working in a FedEx warehouse. It's literally the only place that is hiring.  They treat their workers like garbage, constantly cutting their hours and exposing them to unsafe working conditions. The race to the bottom is spot on...
viva la revolución?
John Oliver logic: tyson chicken managers bet on employees getting covid, so we shouldn’t support meat manufacturers or eating meat
Revolting
Don’t eat American “meat” unless it’s sustainably made. The FDA is a joke the amount of toxins that aloud to be sold to us is horrifying
Now how many of those people that died had shitty health? That part they leave out
If this is how they treat their workers, think about how they treat their livestock 🤔
I worked in a private, small, local meat packing plant. It’s intense, & even our bull meat came from one of those 4 companies who run the meat industry. They’re so corrupt we expelled the USDA b/c the standards they set were written by big companies to hurt little guys, like us. We can operate w/o USDA oversight, & in our little community we did and we did it successfully. We also sold better quality food, & the community paid way more to buy from us, instead of a commercial grocer. We were well treated, because our owner understood the job is hard. It’s the major companies that do this to people.
This is why I don’t eat dead animals
Hey, I used to work for Pilgrims. It really is like a family, as in when there's a murder you look to relatives first.
Worker conditions were a huge part of my decision to be vegetarian. Aside from my love for animals, it'd be hard to say I support social justice when purchasing meat would directly contribute to an environment that not only takes advantage of but endangers minority groups and those in poverty.
Should of went to college sheesh
New logo😃
When i was younger the USA seemed like  the best country in the world, but now that i'm older i prefer Germany by far.
I thought it was an ad for insurance, although exorcism would have been a better guess.
I like eatting meat. I never thought of being a vegetarian. But i might stop eatting meat just as a fuck you to those companies
Was that Immersion Blender thing a paid product placement? I can't tell.
I thought this was about trans women and tucking... Stay safe ladies.
Jesus Christ does everything in America always have to be “controlled by these four companies”?
When that guy said "family" I was getting some serious Jim Jones vibes.
You do realize that in Australia they use the most fantastic robots to process their meat, but for some bizarre reason we keep importing people from third world countries to do the job.  I think Somalia is the latest but we are running out of countries people to exploit.
Bo Pilgrim looks exactly like you'd imagine a guy named Bo Pilgrim would look.
I see another SLAPP suit coming John’s way.
Great way to treat "Family" basically betting on who'll Die first.😑
Failed state.
Oh look, Texas is number 1! Number 1 in giving the least amount of fucks about the people who work for them. I hate this fucking state.
You should really fix your 3rd world counties America.
Jesus. Just stop eating animals.   Challenge yourself to go without meat for a year, and if you can survive without it, why on earth wouldn’t you?
As a European watching this, it's almost impossible to fathom the fact that this is going on in a modern society. The US is so dysfunctional in so many ways. Not that everything is perfect here, but the US seems to lack some basic decency when it comes to how people can be treated by their employees. It's chocking. This is something you expect from a sweatshop in China.
I swear all these meat packing jobs refer to the employees as family. They did when i worked for the chicken processing company Wayne Farms. Disgusting conditions in those plants. My feet still ache from standing so long while i worked there. They gave us 2 10 minute breaks a day plus our lunch break. If you didnt use the bathroom within those time frames it wasnt likely that you were going to be allowed to at all. And if you were even a minute over your 10 minute break you were likely to be reprimanded. Employees in the particular plant i worked at have dropped from heart attacks working there. Others had heart attacks at home after their shift. They also had the in plant medical station. If your hands were sore they had you dip them in warm wax, if your muscles were sore they put biofreeze on them and sent you on your way. They even built a larger ,medical facility on the property so you were even less likely to see a regular doctor because it was cheaper or even free to go to this facility.
I will pay $2 more a lb for my chicken for these guys to be treated humanely.
Oh man, I wish there was a way to stop the demand for this kind of products that mistreats humans and animals. Wait there is a way, go vegan.
But they were wearing masks, so why was COVID spreading?
Meat is greed
watching this with my house rooster, who also cares about the humans in the slaughterhouses and meat packing 🐔
If not for the workers do it for yourself. You dont want food that somebody covered with shit and piss has touched
LWT every week: Unregulated exploitative capitalism is bad and here's why. And here's why again. And here's also why. Why, you ask? Well, let me tell you. About half of the US, still: All hail the almighty Dollar! Unfettered capitalism is the Lord's gospel! Sacrifice your children on the altar of Profit! Regulations are the Devil's work! Worker benefits are for communists! Exploit me harder, daddy!!!
sigh..... live audience can never be replaced
I'll turn to cannibalism before I give up meat.
You mean to say that the companies who don't care for the lives of animals also don't care for the lives of human beings?? What's new?
Sounds familiar. Same story in Germany.
How many years ago was "The Jungle" written?
I will never understand how companies in the US are allowed to do whatever they want and treat workers however they please.  Where are the unions? Where are the labor laws? Where I come from, you can't just fire a worker because you feel like it. There are universal guidelines! Each firing has to be justified, and working conditions and working hours are regulated to ensure companies don't "cross the line". It wasn't always like that, but both the workers and the companies themselves realized things needed to change for the better.   Stuff like this makes me look at the US as some kind of outdated capitalist dystopia, I can't even imagine what these people go through.
of course every company in america is lobbying against osha. what do you fucking expect of that country anymore
All of these kinds of major issues have just one cause, Capitalism.
America is a third world country wearing a Gucci belt.
Modern slavery it's equivalent to United states of America
I worked in an Alaskan fish processing facility for a few years.  Those conditions were actually really fair.  It was hard work, and long hours, but they took safety seriously and we got regular breaks. We were unionized.
Hey John is it too early to panic about the Russian Bird flu?
"buk, buk, buk" Every time you eat your meat, think about these workers!  Buy from local/humane farms if you can!
I’ll be honest. The betting pool doesn’t bother me much, and if he included the workers, I’m pretty sure it wouldn’t bother me at all lol
America need the mafia real mafia take the union's and starting to fuck this corporation's.  America number one in slavery working.  Modern slavery it's equivalent to say United states of America
I have a JBS by the city I live at and they had employees protest because 3 of their co-workers died. The company would have people walk outside in the cold and come back in if they showed to have a temperature and they had lots and lots of ads on the radio about paying $17.35 an hour with "health benefits" it was honestly disgusting
The American Dream in a nutshell. Giving a fuck about human life's and their dignity. Selling wellbeing of human beings for a few bucks hard to even live from and don't take the responsibility for them as a slightest.  Greetings from Europe. I know even here the conditions in meat factories are pretty hard... and the covid infections were high as well here (Google "Tönnies" - The Tyson of Germany)... but WTF!!! As usually I am just shocked how much worse everything can get on the other side of the Atlantic.
Does anyone remember "The Jungle?" It is a book by Upton Sinclair about a meatpacking immigrant's struggles. Back in 1906, it caused a ton of fuss over the horrible meat processing conditions and ended up being the soure of a lot of regulations in the meatpacking industry AT THE TIME.  Now look at the Meatpacking industry today. You be the judge.
Uhhh my uncle in law is the ceo of pilgrims pride. Jason penn. He got indicted by a grand jury last year for price fixing. I dont think hes in jail because we had a family reunion  when my grandfathers grave was revealed and he was there so...
What are some solutions to these issues? My first thought is to create robots or machines to do this work. I know that human hands are far more dexterous and the human eye can interpret the information in front of them faster, but robots would solve many human related issues. I know that sounds terrible to some people who would then lose their job, but how do you continue production while keeping humans safe? Another solution is something I favor, and that is profit sharing within the company. Why would anyone need a mansion like that described in the video while also leaving works living in poverty and not resolving medical needs? I'm not saying creators and business owners shouldn't earn a limited amount for their work, but it seems unreasonable that you would profit off of the oppression of your workers. Profits are also not necessarily direct wage compensation, it can also take the form of actual medical care and worker safety. I know John talks a lot of crap about how bad some of these situations are to bring awareness to them, but can we also offer up some solutions to these issues? He jokes about how to better conditions, but what are some real solutions?
This is exactly why I'm vegan. Tortured animals, abused workers, unhygienic conditions leading to pandemics. I hated participating in this gross system.
That's just modern day slavery tactics those piece of shit companies use on their employees. Fucking ridiculous.
The fact that being a butcher use to be a valuable job where you were safe and paid well.. within about 50 years it went from safe and paid well to absolutely dangerous and paid shit. Not to mention oftentimes the employees are working in a room at the temperature of a refrigerator. I know from personal experience you have to work as fast as humanly possible or you'll be replaced...aren't big companies awesome..
And Republicans like Mitch r trying to prevent these companies from being liable
What’s even more sad is that in America if the workers were given the “right to social distance” I’m pretty sure they’d refuse it anyway... this is from my own experience in an Oklahoma manufacturing facility.
It's weird when you see your local news anchor on this show.
I would've agreed on Judi Dench's placement, but then I saw Cats... Now she's moved down to... 5th place

You don’t need to eat it!
hi i'm from Iowa. thank you for doing this piece because its such a huge problem (everywhere really, but largely) in the Midwest. also, fuck Waterloo.
The robber baron aristocracy in America is going to have to be locked up by real trials and real judges as a federal government reforms itself. Time to push Biden some more.
It's that simple. as always. and not only the USA. https://www.pinterest.com/pin/164874036345843651/ (and this is w/o talking about the animals obviously)
Savage capitalism! Too bad the US isn't a true democracy otherwise, the people would vote for politicians who care. But with the money required to become a candidate and win an election, only those backed by anarchist capitalists get elected and corporate America runs the country. NOT democracy. To become a true democracy, there needs to be a limit on election spending and PACs need to be illegal. Then there needs to be more than 2 parties. But before you get there, you need to put more money into education, so that voters are more educated and therefore can make better choices. So in about 150 to 200 hundred years, maybe, the US might become a democracy and stop being seen as a very rich and powerful "banana Republic" by democratic, somewhat socialist countries!
I will do everything in my power to avoid eating meat and buying from this evil company. It's just hard being a black man from Ghana. Need plant based meat to go super mainstream
Oh Oh, do Autozone next!
"at this point, you're probably wondering how this is possible..."  Not anymore, John. Not anymore
And then they say...we don't need robots/automation...for doing these repetitive works... That hand...which is solving rubic-cubes...as a fun project ...can tomorrow...cut our meats......so don't deny funds for them...
I think it so funny! He talks about how terrible republicans are for 4 straight years. Never taking a brake for more than 3 seconds for a crappy joke that sucks. But now that his home boy is in office he doesn’t say a word about how Biden is taking right and freedoms and shredding them. Or how corrupt he is. What a grifter!
Calling employees "family" and "assets" really means they are a number on a spreadsheet. That's like when a company claims to have "work/life balance."
how about not eating meat?
They should make all the office workers work on the floor of the plants at least one week a year. See how quickly things would change then.
People should take a lesson from Delaware.  Where President Biden and Gov Carney worked to ensure safe labor practices for the states largest industry.  Chicken farming and processing.....  JUST KIDDING!  The state allows Perdue and Mountaire to treat Latin and Hatian immigrants like slaves in return for reelection campaign donations.
Funny how the left is so desperately committed to making people afraid.   They are reaching now that Trump is out of office isn't it.
I didn't watch this video I just came to say that John Oliver has been doing some meatpacking of his own...
😥😔
One thing Mr Oliver didn't mention is that JBS has majority ownership of Pilgrims.  So, the company actually shows upon both lists!
Calling your employees your family is like telling the prostitute you love her
Check out DMMI IN BATTLE CREEK MICHIGAN. Denso Manufacturing Michigan Incorporated, I can't tell you how many times I had to go to the nursing station before I spot to see a doctor about carpal tunnel in both my hands ended up having the surgery and went back to work shortly after to the same exact work that caused the problem all over again. I know people that have had eight surgeries on the same rotator cuff working for this company.
The workers should be more careful
"while a perverted owl.... Just watches" 😆😆🤣🤣💀
Nothing worse than the tone deaf disconnect between home office and the workers.
So now I need to start looking for the "cage free workers" label on any meat I buy.
The problem is these companies hire and exploit illegal immigrants and other low wage workers without any repercussions.  They get a slap on the wrist for fines and just go on and hire again to repeat the cycle.
Stop eating meat , save the planet
fuck corporations and their right
Capitalism is evil. Your boss is not your friend. Profit is theft. Exploitation of labor is a feature, not a bug. The police will not protect you.
There is no bigger lie than "our employees are like family"
Will we be talking about gender equality here too?..   I'm sure employees are massively women
I really used to like this show.
Stop supporting the industry..
This is the most pro worker episode I can remember. All these issues that are being mentioned affect all workers across all industries. Solidarity.
Capitalism is a disease, and it's rotting away our protections for workers and our general compassion for human beings.
Reminds me of the difference between Blue Nile’s factory and corporate culture. Factory composed primarily of south eastern asians afraid to speak up and corporate being a very small group of very attractive white women with a male CFO.
People who need to watch Ms Piggy's sex tape just want to feel better about how much they hate themselves by watching something that is lesser then themselves to laugh at it and shit on it. Its the only way they can like themselves by hating others to alieviate their own painful selfhate. Fucking lizards. Love you John Oliver! 💜💜💜 i like it when YOU swear.
As a guinea pig owner, I can confirm this 100% what happens when your guinea pig drinks too much milk.
Items like this always make me very happy that i live in a country where workers rights and their safety are taken seriously. Even then companies with roots in the US will always look up the edges of what is legal to squeeze a few extra euros out of their employees.
After I saw this I was so disgusted, I felt dizzy.
Hey John, can you cover school openings? Thanks.
Trump and Republicans kept pushing legislation to deny Covid related liabilities at work sites.
AND O.S.H.A reps in the factory ( like  my mother) have gotten death threats, if they even appeared to be considering informing O.S.H.A  of any concerns...oh the "American Dream", if you work hard enough, one day you can have a gold toilet too!
The OSHA fine system runs on a daily basis. So if you are found to have just one fine for $3,700, you have to pay that fine every day the issue is reported on till it’s fixed (7 days= 25K one year=9 million dollars). So they are deceptively low.
This will be a non-issue soon. These jobs will be done by AI robotics. And recently we learned that Bill Gates believes that meat production is KILLING THE EARTH, and we peasants must eat fake meat made from soy grown on his massive farmland holdings. You can trust Bill.
A little disappointing that as a solution there was no reference to creation of workers union that will protect the people working in those factories. Unions are the only real pressure on an industry owner and the more we demonize them the worse it will get for the workers
When you bring in immigrants without giving them citizenship, they get abused.
Obviously you never been to a produce processing facility. It ain't much better.
Isn't this literally the plot of The Jungle? if a book from 115 years ago points out a problem we should have fixed it by now.
Dude I have been waiting for you to talk about Government relief spending and the debt for a year!
Of course they have workplace injuries - it's a slaugtherhouse
Shop employee owned, only companies where workers are family
Big or small. ALL meatpacking companies do this. The one in our small town (5,000 people maybe) deliberately employees anyone with a criminal record and then cuts their pay compared to grocery or major plant meatpacking pay. They know this is the only place that will hire them for a dime more than min wage. No protections. No sick pay. Mandatory 6 days a  week rotating 10-12 hour shifts. If you dare take a day off for anything (a funeral) you're demanded to work your next Saturday 'off'. When I was getting tested for COVID my husband's employer refused to let him quarantine. They literally said, 'We're not paying for you if you have COVID." There's a man who's worked there for decades going blind because of the bacteria in the meat (they slaughter in house too, not just processing) and he's getting NOTHING from this business. These guys can't afford to take off if they're sick, can never take a vacation, and when the pandemic hit the boss passed around a note that said they should be grateful they have a job and all the overtime hours he was providing them (not optional hours BTW). Service Industry corp. has nothing on meatpacking plants/business. It is medieval hell and you're less important than the cow or pig you're cutting up.
I seriously will boycott Tyson products...   Thanks for the heads up, John.
I can't believe companies Target immigrants if only there was somebody who could have done something about that
while it's not a bad idea for ERCOT to fall under federal regulation, it's not necessarily a good idea for us to hook it up to the national grid and activating our interconnection to the national grid would likely not fix the problem anyhow.   as you noted, the main problem is deregulation of the generators. CA's subgrid experienced similar problems when it deregulated generators in the same manner so being interconnected to either the eastern or western grid would likely not have avoided the problems caused by deregulation of the generators. being on their own grids has not stopped US states and territories outside the continental US from being regulated. we'd likely interconnect to the eastern grid on the SPP subgrid which also experienced problems during the storm (though it was delayed by a couple days and they didn't have urban areas which only had enough power to run critical infrastructure so the rolling blackouts wouldn't roll), but it's not like Biden is unaware of the interconnect and didn't consider activating it--it probably would have just caused more problems on the SPP subgrid rather than alleviating our problems. we have an interconnection to Mexico's grid which can be activated is primarily used to get power to the Rio Grande Valley and the areas on the other side of the border from it when they get hit by a hurricane. Mexico has a fully nationalized grid which is more reliant on natural gas and they had rolling blackouts in 26 states. we do a lot of green energy pilot projects on ERCOT. and, probably most importantly, there is a connection to your main story: we don't staff regulators properly at any level of government. our two nuclear plants are regulated by FERC and one of those had a reactor go down during the winter storm.   the problem is SB-7 (76-R) which was passed in 1999 and should be tossed in the trash with the exception of enabling statute for electric co-ops. the legislator you showed talking about the 2011 storm is Glenn Hegar (then a state senator, now the state's comptroller) and he actually got SB-1133 (82-R) passed that year to allow PUC to force generators to weatherize, but it conflicted with several areas of statute which were enacted under the 1999 legislation.
Gosh this reminds me of Radium Girls ... but instead it’s chickens....we really haven’t learned anything.
I wonder who won that betting pool... 🤔
I worked in food industry for five years now and I tell people this shit all the time privately. I am glade that you hit on the immigration and the general workers of the line.
Organize, food workers.  A strong labor union would address most of these problems.
I appreciate John Oliver's anger so much.
Fast food nation talks about the meat packing industry, their workers, and how they get away with this. It a good read I recommend it
I’d like to just touch upon something that was mentioned in this clip in a little bit more depth to further the point that, no, employers don’t care at all. (This is pretty much a tangent.and is not to say that the rest of the points in the video are invalid or less important). I’m a workers’ comp adjuster (i.e., the bad guy whose clients are not the injured workers/claimants but are the employers) who handles claims in the states of New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Delaware, and Texas.  I want to first point out that, in the United States, workers’ compensation is a no-fault program. Very much like New Jersey’s no-fault auto-insurance, there are VERY few reasons you can still sue your employer for a work-related injury. You would not be able to file a civil suit while collecting workers’ comp benefits. You can file claim petitions (this is not necessarily “suing”) against your employer if you are on any level of workers’ comp benefits OR if your claim was denied in the first place (in some states like Massachusetts, a claim petition is referred to as a form number). There are, like, almost only ever two reasons anyone would ever be fired for a workers’ comp claim—and even then, it’s not really merely because they are collecting comp benefits (this being a functional capacity exam giving permanent light duty restrictions that cannot be accommodated long-term OR legitimate insurance fraud/defrauding workers’ comp).  Now that that’s out of the way…  A lot of the problems I encounter in my day is simply the result the worker not knowing what to do. I’ll kinda exaggerate the percentages here for simplification, but I would say that 75% of claims reported to me late are the result of not knowing to report them in the first place or not knowing who to go to for medical treatment. They don’t know that they need to report prior to seeking medical treatment (in some states, sorta-kinda-maybe), and 15% of this group only finds out IF the doctor’s office happens to be experienced enough in workers’ compensation to have the brains to tell the injured employee to go to their employer first.  Another 10% of problems is the result of a language barrier when reporting. Workers tend to feel that they need to complete their written injury reports in English. This is not true, and no judge of compensation in any state will accept this as true either. Workers can report in whatever language they feel most comfortable; adjuster actually encourage this. Claims administrators and adjusters like me have literally no issue hiring a certified translator (we do have those). If something is not reported, then we don’t accept it as part of the claim. I’ve had a few claims where, for example, someone slipped and fell. She hit her head, reported only her head, but then claims literally five weeks later that her knee was also in pain. Turns out that she hit her knee on a nearby table.  The other 15% of claims is a combination of the employer taking its sweet-ass time to report the claim to its claims administrator, the employer delaying the initial claims investigation in an incredibly desperate and outright ridiculous attempt to deny a claim that really should be accepted as compensable from the get-go, and the employer’s internal issues (such as creating panels of their workers’ compensation medical providers in States like Pennsylvania where that really matters).  The problem is that, at least with my employers, they are multi-location employers. One of my clients is a school district, but it has dozens of schools across a city with twelve zip codes. The other is a nursing facility with locations in five or six states. Although there is a central department overseeing workers’ comp within the employers’ internal organization, that still leaves it to the individual locations to do their jobs properly. Unfortunately, even if the central/corporate workers’ comp department cares, the individuals at lower levels may not. And this is 100000% being overburdened with their actual jobs (such as the nursing facility with its main contacts in each respective facility having to assist with actual nursing jobs due to understaffing that has only gotten worse with covid shutdowns).  I would argue that, at the most, 1% of the claims I’ve ever had would qualify for an investigation into fraud allegations; maybe 0.00000000001% of those suspected claims ought to be prosecuted legitimately as fraud.  As such, 99.999999% of these aforementioned problems are employers unsurprisingly the result of the employer’s failure to really care. It’s often the result of the employer not really educating their employees on reporting protocol and employee workers’ compensation rights until their claim goes to an adjuster or giving help where it is needed so that the supervisors responsible for reporting from the individual locations can do their jobs timely.  Employers are too reactive no matter how proactive they think they are (or are proactive in the wrong areas). I may work for the employer side of workers’ comp, but I have had MANY moments where I butt heads with an employer because the employer wants to do something that will bite everyone involved in their asses. Sometimes, while speaking with an employee, I really do want to tell them to get a lawyer. I feel that bad for some of them.  And even when the employee does something that ultimately benefits the employer, the employer runs with it without considering any possible consequences. My father is a butcher. There have been many days he has come home with horrible cuts that he patched up with Neosporin and a band-aid. How he has yet to lose any of his fingers from infection after almost thirty years of working at this grocery store is beyond me. He has filed only ONE workers’ comp claim for a laceration due to the excessive bleeding and discoloration (which was most probably the result of him being on blood thinners). He went to only the ER and decided to remove the sutures himself, and not once did his employer tell him to keep going for treatment. Yes, you can’t force anyone to go to the doctor. However, it goes to show how heartless employers can be by not at least mandating the employee (my dad in this case) go to a work comp doctor to ensure that there is no infection from how he removed his own sutures.  Meanwhile, I always hear every employer that I work with bitch and moan about costs.  “Emma, what do you think our exposure on this claim is?” Instead of asking me this, have you tried reaching out to the dude/dudette and ask how they’re doing? Because you—the employer—can save a lot in medical costs and litigation costs just by being a person to another person.
The irony of worrying about workers’ safety when you’re killing millions of animals
And this is why I don’t buy processed factory meats anymore
*Laughs in european*  But not for long. Umm ok tube does not mark star. Also we are farked soon too.
I don't work in the meatpacking industry but I do work in a factory and I 100% felt like you were talking about my job. USA is shit
They claim it's a "family" business because labor law is different for family businesses.
Have you tried eating less meat? You know, to lower the demand a tick and maybe give one of these people a bathroom break?
Currently watching this from the office of a company in the meatpacking supply chain... Also the grandchild of a Haitian Immigrant who worked in a poultry factory...
If you eat meat you are rewarding these companies for being evil. If you think this is anything new read "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair. If you want to see any change for the better boycott all meat products until the industry is cleaned up. Becoming a vegetarian is easy and healthy. If you are unwilling to make this small change to your life then you are part of the problem.
Best thing to do in situations like this is to call out the corporations and then BOYCOTT them. They truly only care about the 💰. So take it away from them.
Family do not dose eachother with exsessive antibiotics, steriods and sanitation toxins and lie to themselves about it. Thats not a family i want to be a part of.
everyone please limit your meat intake. for the workers and the environment.
Here's a tip for you: If someone ever says that their company is like a family, TURN AND RUN IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. They only say that to encourage you to be loyal to the company, but they're never loyal back. Real families support each other. But big corporations just expect you to devote all of your time and resources to them; to the point that you won't have time for your real family.
One thing John didn't get into, but certainly could have: A lot of the immigrants meatpackers hire are in the US illegally. The meatpackers do this on purpose, because it means that whenever an employee starts complaining about working conditions, one phone call to ICE and they get deported. The meatpacking company management, who absolutely knew they were illegally hiring illegal immigrants, *never* faces punishment of any kind for this practice.
Oh man, i knew it was gonna be bad, but DAMN
Veganism is looking more appealing for enforcing the safety of humans rather than the rights of animals.  This whole segment has dark echoes of the Chicken piece.
surprised there’s no technology to automate meat packing with machines. i understand it gives people jobs, but at what cost to the employees?
Ah, just another reason for me to never move to this hellhole of a country
Third world country wearing a gucci belt...
I hate that the local camera crew filming a piece about this office's culture that will one day being uncomfortably juxtaposed to how its company treats workers in its factories is also my local camera crew.
When I hear about how rich people in America treat there employees like slaves just sickens me. The owners of these plants if they wonted to could take good care of there workers and still make tons of money they just choice not to because of greed. Makes you lose faith in human beings. My heart goes out to all those that suffer from these sad excuses of human beings. No one should have to endure what I just saw. I pray God somehow will fix this it’s just so so sad.
I was waiting for the pork packing pee story to come up. The manager of that facility during that incident was second in command of the place I work at immediately before, and one of his biggest policies here was dictating which restrooms employees could use at which times. He didn't like the idea of people "leaving production areas" during work time to use the larger restrooms up front even if they were actually closer for 90% of the staff than the shop floor restrooms.  Most of our workers had little trouble just ignoring that rule, fortunately.
Another reason Americans should stop eating so much meat.
I gave up buying factory meat a few months ago and never regretted it. I pay a bit more, but everything is way more high quality and I don't have to worry about the incessant animan cruelty. If you don't live near farms who sell direct check out online options that send you farmer sourced meat every month. You might pay a bit more but you aren't supporting Tyson and will know where your meat is coming from.
It's always the people at the top that don't give a flip about everyone else
Or, I don’t know, here’s just another reason to stop eating meat 🤷‍♀️🥴🤪
I always wonder if a show writer is from West Michigan.  They seem to include news segments from West Michigan news stations often.  Not sure if it's a good or bad thing to see your local news on a national show.
Fines need to cost more than fixing the original issue.
those conditions are terrible i know for a fact
Well, made the decision to switch to MOSTLY vegetarian just a bit before this, after listening to and reading more Dick Gregory.
why is it the longer im alive the more america looks like a third world nation with what is basically  a call of duty dlc skin over it to make it look nice
Hey John...... Could you do an episode on Fudgepacking!
it gets on my nerve when people like Elon Musk praise de-regulation
Texas won't follow Federal regulations but the other 49 can bail them out when their "plan" fails?  Biden is too  nice.
Why even make this show? Just mention the name of any company and they're guaranteed to be grinding human meat into money one way or another.  700,000 people watched this. 98 percent of them agreed with it.  Everyone rolled over, went to sleep afterwards and did absolutely nothing about it.
john oliver thank you
Corporations like these are working really hard to turn the U.S. into China.
thank you
Speak about Indian farmers protest, undemocratic practices n human rights abuse of the  right wing establishment.. thanks..
I worked at a Predue chicken plant. I quit after my first shift. I felt worse for the animals but my co workers were miserable. I think they were trying to open a doorway to hell.
I've worked for a poultry plant. It's fucked up, Really fucked up. This video only scratches the surface of how bad it is.
After reading "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair, I was unable to eat meat for a good while. As I understand it, that book helped bring about improved regulation of meatpacking plants when it was published 95 years ago because people found it so horrific. After I saw news reports about how conditions.in meatpacking plants today are putting employees at risk of COVID, I went to pretty much eggs and walnuts as my sources of protein.
Basically anything our teachers told us was fixed in the past is a lie. Racism, sexism, workers' rights. Now even the meat packing industry is still a mess? Is there anything we've actually fixed since the 40s? Even Nazis are thriving in 2021.
I love meat so much it's like I was almost genetically engineered to love it
This shit is fucking horrific... But it is SO DAMN NICE to get stories like this that aren't all about Drumpf. Stories that make you want to really go push for change.
I'm so glad you are back john❤️
Time to read The Jungle again...
YouTube thinks this is what I want to see first thing in the morning.
Wer're fucked..
This is why the farm worker exploitation argument against veganism is so disingenuous.
Stop kink—shaming the owl
Poor leadership!  No plan B.  No advice on how to collect water, drain pipes and stay warm.
Sure it may be a nasty job but did they expect something different? It’s a meat packing plant. And the ones that are near me give out thousands of free meals a month to people in need so maybe the community is their family.
Long term,  either we need to eat less meat,  or use A. I. bots to do the dangerous work.
A disgusting industry run by pure demons.
Nice to know that nurses in a dangerous business are less effective than school nurses. School nurses at least give you some ice and ginger ale
"This story is gonna make you vomit in your mouth every time you look at any sandwich ever"
I took 14 ambient once and racism wasn’t not a side effect, however being attacked by aliens and waking up getting my stomach pumped and drinking charcoal was
I guess I'm vegetarian now.
Imagine caring what someone is betting anyone? Who gives a shit?!
This sounds exactly like capitalism. I got money, you do this else you are fired!
Classic GOP deregulation. All this result in the exact same way. profits over people. moral compass broken. hell they treat the workers like factory farmed animals
dude you aint even funny. get a real job.
without strong regulation, that's how every industry ever is, has been and will be run. it's a symptom of capitalism
How can we expect an industry that treats animals like shit to treat humans any better?
Hey, how many episodes has he done on President Biden? Oh none, *that's weird*
I work in this industry and the continued attack on regulations is horrifying. Companies will push as much as they can down the line. Line speed regulations protect workers and consumers.
And this story is only about the effects of the meat industry on workers. The same industry is also massively harmful to the health of it's consumers, the environment and for disgusting treatment of animals. Kind of makes you wonder why we, as a species, still embrace this practice so strongly.
My mom works at Perdue
No pain no gain. That's why you British snowflakes lost your empire. Stop breaking up families. Because of the immigrant parents, their kids will be office workers. But when you show up in New Yawk as an English overlord, I guess you won't understand 💪🙏👍 long live sacrifice 🙊🙉🙈
with 15/16y old i thought living in the USA would be pretty nice, now with 30 watching this channel,  theres a 100% chance that will never happen. as a working adult, german working laws are just not comparable to give them up lul
This video is brought to you by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
It's amazing how much we've corrupted things to where we look to blame the workers first rather than ask why they would behave in such a way to begin with.
Wow the meat industry is dishonest and unethical? I am so surprised /s
NO SURPRISE that the meat industrie is not intrested in treating living beeings with respect. Otherwise there would be none of these nightmarish job-environments.   Hope this next sentence doesn't digust you as much as abused mammals pissing themselves in cramped spaces: Please go vegan folks.
“A fraction of a fuck”   I’m using that at some point today
Worked at a processing plant for chicken back in the 90's. Same thing was going on then as now.
Its time for an overhaul controlled by the people who actually keep this country functioning
JBS gives you a phyciatic evaluation every month if you work on the kill floor. My company told me to not to service them during covid as they have had outbreaks.
Sounds like these companies get their "nurses" from the same place schools do.  The street.  Any warm body will do.  Seriously, the only thing wore useless than a school nurse is a school counselor .
5:25 “in a situation where he MAY have FELT like he had to.”  LOL really? Really? That’s our standard of news?
I said "Demonic Guinipig" the same time Daddy John did, I think we have a psychic bond
I have a very simple solution to the terrible conditions for humans and animals in these factories: we all go vegan
Or just stop eating meat.
It's so bad, I feel bad for any kid who grows up in a Packer household. Those poor children, being forced to wear cheese on their heads before they understand what they're doing.
👏.   👏.  👏. 👏.👏.👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 - vegans
Nice to hear a story that doesn't involve politics. Workers rights have taken a lot of hits lately. Time to give government its teeth back. God Bless The Working Man and women.
Are we willing to pay double the price for meat products? Can majority of Americans afford to do so on today's wages or government assistance programs?
UNIONIZE!
Absolutely disgusting!
Now that both the conditions of workers AND animals have been exposed, let's take a sec to think how much these companies give a fuck about the quality of the food they provide for their clients. Think about the moral restraints they sure have regarding the abuse of antibiotics, hormones and other toxic substances along the manufacturing line. I quitted meat years ago and never missed it so far.
Discussion of how workers are exploited, no discussion of them organizing????? Oliver is clearly pointing to some harsh realities, but these are only possible without robust unions to put a stop to it. If Oliver really wants to advocate for durable change, the only way that can come about is through unionization. Laws can be changed for better now and worse later. The gutting of Osha is just one aspect of how neoliberalism has crippled any obstacle to profit for these companies, and the crux of that neoliberal strategy is the removal of unions. Work doesn't get done without workers, thus their organization is the only viable long term solution to exploitation.
I wonder why people put up with this type of employment. Quit or stop your bitching. This people are enablers. Only thing companies get is revenue. Hit them where it matters by demanding more or simply not accepting the position.
Going Vegan would end all this horrific Shite. The cruelty, the filth, the disease all unnecessary. Eating meat is carcinogenic and causes many other diseases. Vegan 8 years. Do it for the Animals, do it for mankind, do it for the planet. If you care Quit making stupid effing selfish excuses and do it.  The Corona virus pandemic  would not be here if people were Vegan.
Sadly consumers are to blame as well..... People stop being so inherently hungry, we can eat less and live longer... You don't live longer the greedier you are.  Do we really need buckets of fried chicken? Buckets though?
Great, now I'm hungry
OMG! I'm going to laugh about "robot fuck a soup" the rest of my life John!!!! haha thank you!
Return the means of production to those who actually run them.
This is America
One thing we can do is to stop eating animal products. It's cruel, unhealthy and unnecessary. There is nothing good about it for people, the planet or the animals.
Go vegan folks! Talking about the hell animals are going through whilst still supporting it financially makes you a massive dickhead.
Oh, now you're going to blame this on Our Orange Savior because he appointed people to OSHA to weaken the restrictions! Hey, this stuff was going on for over a century and the socialist Democrats haven't done anything to alleviate it. Watch Biden and see if he even talks about it, well, except for the frozen poultry workers, lately. Nothing will be done and the bribes will keep appearing.
I like to buy meat 1/4 cow or 1/2 hog at a time from local farms, but man this makes me want to buy 100% locally sourced. It's not any more expensive with beef or pork since you're buying a large amount (albeit you're spending $600-900 all at once for the year), but chickens are typically at least twice as much per pound... at this point though, its probably worth it....
This absolutely makes me furious- I'm pledging to myself right now to ban the "big" meat packing companies & buy locally as much as I can & try to cut back on eating meat. I don't think I can go vegetarian, but I can I certainly try my best to not be part of the problem.
Ironic the US pointing fingers towards accusing china for forced work
The device you’re watching this on, the workers went through 100x worse than wearing a diaper. John you’re a piece of shit
Eyyy I was living in Waterloo when the Tyson plant shut down. It was estimated that that single outbreak accounted for 80-90% of our county's cases at the time.
This is so much worse than I could imagine thank God years ago I gave up gmos and nothing but organic meat /meatless meals people have to make these changes eat less meat people
Thats why I am vegetarian 😉❤️
or you savages could just stop eating meat
Don't worry. Status Quo Joe is on it.
John Oliver Plz do Indian farmers protest
John, where have you been the last 84 years? We really needed you!
"Rule of Acquisition 111. Treat people in your debt like family, exploit them." Should we just base our entire societal understanding off of Star Trek? It seems that Star Trek calls like fucking everything.
Everything involved in the production of industrialized meat is the reason I stopped patronizing fast food/chain restaurants many years ago. If we just put all the McDonald's, Burger Kings, Hardee's, Bojangles, etc. out of business, humans and animals AND the planet would be much, much better off.  Not even a vegetarian, I just hate the American obsession with low-grade meat. And the moronic glorification of bacon, though that seems to have died down after a few years of being everywhere in pop culture.
This is the best expose on meatpacking I have ever seen. THANK YOU
got 8 mins in. srry i cant. fucking heartbreaking. these POS rich people.
Another amazing and scary episode. After that sarcastic "namaste", I hope one day we can see an episode focused on cultural appropriation with a mention of how overly whitewashed yoga is now, in the West. John would make it a blast.
This was the wrong John Oliver episode to watch during dinner -.-
I don't have to worry at all about using that industries toxic product or participating in the employee abuse inflicted by that industry because I've been eating plant based for 36 years supporting the organic American farmer. and at 56 years old, I feel 26 and can run 10 miles right out my front door. Not bragging, just reporting the awesome long term benefits of by meat free lifestyle.
Why isn't The Kroger Co. mentioned in this too? They are a huge enabler for the "big four".
Its ALL for eating and exploiting animals, that is the undeniable truth. That is the root cause of pandemics, antibiotic resistance, climate change... and almost all heart health problems and dietary diseases. Cut it down! Reduce it, stop being selfish.
I feel like I remember a book written about this. Some guy named Eustice? No, Umberto? Nah, Upton. Yeah, Upton. There was some landscape he compared this to. Was it a forest? No, that's not right. Oh, yeah, a jungle. I seem to remember a guy named Upton Sinclair writing The Jungle about this kind of thing a hundred years ago. Clearly we just all kind of forgot.
this whole piece reminds me of the reaction to upton sinclair publishing _the jungle._ "hey get a load of how awful these meat processing workers are treated, they get body parts chopped off and it just gets ground up into your food while they bleed to death on the factory floor." "OH MY GOD!" "right?!" "THERE'S BODY PARTS IN MY FOOD?!" "...well yes but that wasn't really--" "WE NEED SOME KIND OF FOOD SAFETY STANDARDS SO I'M NOT EATING BODY PARTS!" "okay but the workers--" "THAT IS DISGUSTING. I CAN'T BELIEVE CUSTOMERS WOULD BE TREATED LIKE THIS!"
Sweet and sour pork 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
American CEOs: Our employees are like family.  Ferengi Rule of Acquisition: Treat employees like family, exploit them.
Don't they have a union in the US??
I worked for jbs beef.and I have kidney and bladder problems now lol also so acid showering was used when people called osha
i was a bit surprised when i started working on my feet here in texas and pretty much no one offers workers comp at all.
My boss treats me like family, in that, he gives me time off if I need it and respects my autonomy. Like a step family, where we aren't blood related but trying not to suck. A previous boss called us a family, but that was at a call center and the vibe was quite different...
Absolutely horrific.
Meanwhile, Republicans are trying to put liability protection in place for these companies.
Please, if this upsets you, please consider greatly reducing your consumption of meat and animal products or going some days without animal products at all.
This video is blocked for my friends in Australia.
Just stop eating meat already
Boston, LA, NY, Seattle....the fking rest burn that thing to the ground.
Yeah, in Germany we had the same case with a grand meatery. Don't think anything will change...
deep state going after meat eaters
the irony of that family who lost the older guy is that none of them are wearing fucking masks in their interviews, either.
I'm from Texas and I can attest that our Right To Work laws are fucked.
Upton Sinclair.. The Jungle.. at it again. #doomed to repeat it
"This company is like a family..." Sure. The Lannisters.
16:44 Damn straight! Hear, hear!
Just watched Super Size Me 2.  How the chickens are raised. They have heart attacks on the way to be slaughtered, they cannot walk.
This man gives stupid a bad name.
Love this show, but did you ever notice John Oliver’s fingers are strangely spaced out and pointy, like if they were previously frozen but never completely thawed out.. #CreepyWitchFingers
Appalling.  Slavery is alive and well
Solution, get rid of meatpacking plants altogether and invest in locally owned and operated butcher shops. Win win.
I quit all beef, chicken, fish, pork etc 10 yrs ago.  Haven’t missed them yet. Here in Hawai’i the favorite protein in tofu which we stir fry w fresh produce and herbs from our gardens.
I know a single individual, or show, doesn't have time to deal with every employment violation.  We need to change where needed, and not just give attention to what's some people are saying deserves to be trendy. What happens at these meat packing plants is simply representative of what so many employers will do whenever they can.
the majority of the employee's are immigrants,  who are willing to work in  conditions  your average American won't go near because they feel it is demeaning, and abusive. Things need to change.
When people and companies are able to pay fines to avoid being accountable for their actions there is no such this as punishment anymore.
One of the many reasons going vegan is the right thing.  The meat industry is not just disgusting and horrific for the animals, it is also horrific to humans. Slaughterhouse workers have higher rates of PTSD and injuries than active military, they are one of the highest employees of disadvantaged people, even the farm "owners" are put into debt to companies like Tyson, to a point where they are forced to keep working for Tyson or they WILL lose everything.  The meat industry is beyond evil, and it all happens because we want our sensory pleasure from eating the dead flesh of animals.
Only John Oliver can take a subject like Meatpacking and make it a potential Emmy winning segment. Bravo!
Thank you for reporting this story.  It's not new.  The Covid  danger is added to the mess but workers in  meat processing plants have experienced a long history of atrocious conditions.  I don't understand why people don't care.  (I haven't eaten meat in over 40 years)
John Oliver's an OG
and on top of that, Many Companies in America take Life Insurance Policies out on their sick employees and make money off their deaths-while the deceased's family gets NOTHING! CAPITALISM gone TYRANT!
That betting pool is a normal thing where people are making good money. It's not disgusting, its people. When I worked at Lilly we bet every football game of the season and everything in between. We bet on everything! So stop this nonsense that Betting at work is a disgusting thing.
When I heard the part about the guy with crushed hands signing the waiver with a pen in his teeth... I had to hit pause and stare through the wall for a minute.  If corporations are people, this one is psycho.
I wish this was only the Meat industry.  Name some that actually  treat their  workers humanely.  I'll just wait.
Caralho einh JBS
If it's exclusively about the highest profits for the companies and no fucking thing else, people with little power get fucked over as hard as possible. It might be one of the darker sides of capitalism, but what do I know? If only people could be protected from exploitation with... with laws... or smth...
So basically, nothing since the publication of "The Jungle" has been done.
Try being a truck driver, pissing in a bottle is the way of the road. Way she goes bud.
"Hello." ... "Hello." "Follow me." "Ok."
The US  sucks. We value profit over everything.
Bro, I live in Waterloo IA and it sucked hearing that knowing some kids of parents who tested positive who worked there.
Another American industry in which "fines" are just the cost of doing business.
A "blank check for $ 10.000.00 " is non sequitor. It's blank. It's $10k. It's $10k unsigned. It's signed and there is an agreement it can be assigned a value later. Have I left anything out?
UNIONS!
Americans are acting like their companies aren't making people around the globe work like this for DECADES. But now that it's on their country they are all *shocked Pikachu face*
Your assessment of Judy Dench is spot on.
Let the Marxist indoctrination continue...
This is worse than how the fucking chicken farmers are treated! 🤬
Workshop on meditation for office workers while no bathroom breaks for the working class. 😡😡
Go vegan
welcome to the slaves of america
In an Australian court that Tyson medical/no sue waiver would immediately be ruled as "under duress" and thrown out.
Could someone sue Tyson for false advertising?  Since they claimed to love their workers
Yawn this isn’t a real issue, I’m Jewish bud.
Support the PRIME Act and help us small scale traditional farmers break this government mandated centralized monopoly.
You think horrendous of ANYTHING is subject to only meat packing plants?!   MAN! GTFOH Every single company in existence; PERIOD! violates their employees rights in one way or another EVERY SINGLE DAY!
Denied bathroom breaks? Sounds like working on the production line at Nissan in Tennessee
I don't eat meat for ethical reasons- both because of the animals and the humans that are stuck working in these conditions, pushed to the brink to meet such an insane demand.
By family they mean you’re like their kid that has to do whatever they say for little to no pay.
For people that want facts...  0.4% of the works have died.   Same rate as CDC has published.
"we are a family here and can talk about everything"  around the world, code for: we don't want a union, don't you dare to ask for more rights!
Im from EU and even if things here arent ideal, USA seems like whole new level of disfunctional. Not sure how they get away with calling themselves a democracy or land of the free sometimes. I think USA should start looking at EU as an example of how things should be.
If those workers would just realize that Covid-19 is just a hoax and a political machination then they could stop being sick, get back to work and focus on their goddamn carpal tunnel.
All the people who inhale meat because vegetables make them insecure hate all the immigrants that do this work too.
how shocking.. managers who earn money by exploiting and enslaving sentient beings aren't treating other setient beings well? Woooow
So basically the unions are doing nothing to protect their own members, the corporations get free reign because they just pay everyone to keep quiet as long as possible, and we pay PREMIUM dollar for a product produced for literal pennies. Why aren't more regulations in place?!? Oh ya because if enough people make enough money it's all legitimate.
This is why libertarianism is garbage.
So glad this was different than the other meat videos. Thanks for making it. Was praying it was not PETA calling me names for liking Bacon.
I thank God for those workers. I don't know how they do it. Horrific industry!! OSHAM®!
...on a related note, Beyond Beef is pretty tasty. Just in case, you know, you're turned off of eating meat by this story.
Land of the free🤣🤣 More land of the slaves
Don't call them family call the owner disgusting greedy for money the root of all evil monster your money🤔
1:13 John Oliver dropping bars
Fetch the Holy Hand Grenade, that guinea pig's dynamite.
I worked at one of the largest slaughterhouses in the us, and I’d see people pee in the meat wash sinks. If something gets dropped, you take it to one of those sinks to sanitize it, but everyone would just throw it back onto the belt instead lol. The chain moves really fast, if you step away for even a minute, you’ll have a huge pile up and your red hat giving you the evil eye. I could tell endless bad things about working there.
Jon Oliver looks like a quokkas.
This is why eating meat does not only affect non-human animals, it affects humans as well. If you are a believer in human rights I say you should stop eating body parts.
So  basically,  and clearly, the United States of America  still practise  and condone slavery! Not  a very uplifting  thought  is it?
Boycott Tyson and all factory farm, industrial slaughterhouse industry. Stick it to the man. Go vegan!
Clearly the ad is for their new guinea pig meat products.
Looks like little has changed since the Jungle was published over 100 years ago. Meatpacking still scams on immigrants.
I worked at a JBS plant for 5 years. It was rough and I was lucky enough to never have to work the production lines, but Jesus christ Tyson is shit. So many employees at JBS talked about Tyson being actual hell. Thank God I quit before Covid happened.
i wonder why the american right wingers have been that happy that trump has met with north korea xD maybe they wanted to learn a thing or two about workers rights
Anyone else expecting an "Adam Driver" joke instead of "a medium aggressive pigeon"?
If you watch this and find yourself thinking, 'Well yeah, but if the companies took all those measures, the price of meat would skyrocket...', I would invite you to spend a cup of coffee searching all the other fucking Kafkaesque effects of meat on the wider world and ask yourself whether it might not just make sense for prices to go up a bit and reflect more of the industry's real cost to society.
Be like me. Don't eat meat or fish. Boycott them all. Improve your health.  Extend your life. Help save the Earth.
We hear people denounce veganism for many reasons, but at least vegans are trying to DO something about the conditions and the pain and suffering of the animals, human and non-human. The humans who work in slaughterhouses also suffer PTSD and some are already complete sociopaths and beat the animals for no reason... just because they can... no focus on mental health, etc.  these industries prey people as much as they do on the animals. If everyone went vegan, we could drive change. Before everyone jumps on the “but people need jobs” bandwagon, industries change all the time and jobs adjust. Just like when Blockbuster went under, no one was screaming to save their jobs and keep renting vhs tapes. We all adapted to the change and folks got different jobs. If you care about people, the planet or animals, you’ll go vegan. Check out challenge22.com for support.
Put a Box over your head what is the skyrim what the fuck.
U N I O N I Z E
Painfully unfunny
Go vegetarian, people!
This is one of the main reasons why I gave up eating any form of industrialized meat. I eat almost no animal product. And if I do, I buy from one of a few local farmers directly.
Why doesn’t he talk about joe biden not condemning the ccp.
My kids are forbidden to form a union and I pay them nothing for the work I make them do, I know exactly how Tyson feels.
Did these people not choose to work there?
@1:01 At first, I thought he had cooked up the demented guinea pig and was serving it up for dinner.
You do realize that the republicans have a solutions for these problems? Just get another job. Preferably one that pays well. Why don't these workers understand that?  Do I need to mark this as sarcasm?
Brainwashed Americans not being able to believe that, in their hyper-capitalist system, workers are being taken advantage and treated like crap. Wake tf up. You are the premier example of it.
These places have to run like this to produce enough meat to feed all these people its not the governments fault for not fining them enough its people fault for eating ungodly amounts of meat
As a small beef rancher I wanna say thank you. This is ruining our industry
hola john
JBS never ending source of proud for Brazilians... Their goal is to have ten billion dollars companies under them in five years. They probably will. Unfortunately.
you know im something of a meatpacker my self
Or we should make factory farms illegal just like countries in the EU.
Read Upton Sinclair’s “The Jungle”. Things have changed very little to nothing at all
Yay capitalism!
It was a betting pool.  Who cares? What does that have to do with meat packing?
get them from the desk to the meat line so they can move a little
Subtitles: "workers rr family" lol
MAGA
Shoutout to my local news station making John Oliver for calling out how crazy our country is. Good job WZZM.
Can we please never go back to live audiences again? This show is just elevated to a whole new level of amazing without them.
It's almost like the USA, was being run by unprincipled capitalists for 4 years.
Fraction of a fuk is noted
I have an Idea can we start a "go fund me" for these employees so they can quit until change is made or they find other work. FIGHT BACK!!!!
As a Star Trek fan, I can't help but be reminded of one of the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition: "Treat your workers like family: exploit them!" It seems the fictional race representing the most greedy, toxic, untrustworthy, despicable, and without any empathy is neither fictional nor another race.
The only times I've seen money wasn't first, was all the times money was no object. Every other time,,,, money was the problem. The "Golden Gate Bridge" and "Hoover Dam" were built acknowledging about 1 death per million dollars spent.  Who got each million per death?
Wow I've heard of ethically raised chickens, why not do humans next.
While becoming a vegetarian may sit well with you, companies like McDonalds, Burger King,  Chic-fil-a, Costco, and Walmart are the ones that will have to demand that things change before anything does.  Haha...who am I kidding.  This will never change.  Never.
Go Vegan🌱💚
at this point i fucking hate capitalism. i am thankful for covid to shine a light on this dumpster fire of a system
STRENGTHEN UNIONS
I’m more likely to go vegan watching a video like this, frankly.
I feel a boycott coming on......
If you job refers to associates as family... RUN!
Shut the fuck down all these packaging lines for good! Who eats this shit anyway? Ahh right "we" are actually their clients and we don't give a fuck about the overall tragic impact of such "foods". This just proves how fucked up we are as the species on this planet. We cannot even change the way we eat in order to prevent ourselves from dying in some shitty pandemic, caused directly by such very shitty practices!
I'm almost starting to think that companies....are bad
Burn it all down
wow these chicken nazis make Bezos look christlike
Somebody wrote a book in 1906 about this sort of thing.
It makes me sick to my stomach how chickens are treated. I have predicted the unspeakable cruelty , accepted by society, was only a stepping stone to continued cruelty and genocide of the lower classes and foreigners.  As Ghandi said, how we treat the least of us are how we are judged. Dogs cats horse and other animals are treated better than humans. And our valuable wildlife are continued to be exterminated. The psychopaths are in charge.
What about Amazon? They are even worse.
Good thing I am vegetarian.
What would you rather do? Close the plant down, put them all out of work destroying their lives that way? It's just the flu. 98% survival rate assuming you even know you've had it. Besides who are you to talk? You work for HBO, a Warner Media affiliate.
OSHA has few employees and no teeth. Forming unions (in LITERALLY the same industries that started them in the US) is now virtually impossible. This is the world of deregulation in which corporations write the laws. Texas right now is seeing firsthand what deregulation produces.
I think meatpacking facilitys are the capitalist answer to animal-right-activists: If you treat your workers like animals they can't complain about inhumane condition for the animals because it's _very much_ "humane".
Man america is one hell of a shithole, i cant believe that most of my life i believed it was the pinnacle of society and democracy
We could fight the lengthy battle over regulating one of the most powerful industries in America, or we could just stop eating meat. Artificial meat is right around the corner
America is a dystopia
Worked in IT at Tyson. Then they gutted IT and outsourced nearly the whole thing.
I don't really care about the people in the meatpacking industry but I do care about the animals. Because if we start treating the animals better, you'll see better conditions on up the line, too, leading to the workers as well.   PS: my livestock and pets are my #1.
When he say hoy shit you know something its wrong
“Sorry to Bother You” get more and more relevant everyday....
For those weirded by the first commercial - it was pretty clearly alluding to the rabbit scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The way it was shot is more than a subtle reference. Still creepy but it has an explanation.
I really need to commit to eating meat less. Our society is overly consume in having too much anyway And not caring for workers
You wanted pure unregulated capitalism - enjoy it.
thank you hbo and john oliver
Thought I was watching A Closer Look with Seth Meyers with that call back at the end.
Please america go vegan TF NOW
It’s so nice that since Trump’s loss John moved from “how shitty is everything in politics” to “how shitty is everything else besides politics that we didn’t have a chance to cover for about four years”
And yet, I am sure that for about half the people watching this segment, the image of the worker relieving himself under the table while processing meat above it is going to be the lasting image. Upton Sinclair also tried calling attention to people's suffering in the meat packing industry, and failed... at least in that regard.
I saw someone post that our generation needs a new Upton Sinclair to write a new "The Jungle."  Sadly, people already do.  Books and documentaries as earth-shakingly revealing as "The Jungle" are released all the time.  Unfortunately, the wealthy and elites today live in a society that does all their work of shutting it down for them, by drowning it out in an avalanche of entertainment.  Game-changing books like "Uncle Tom's Cabin" or "The Jungle" came out during a time when everyone literate read books.  They processed information and ideas thoroughly, one source at a time, with nothing else to distract them, not even radio for background noise.  If something outstanding was published in the pre-internet (or even pre-TV, or pre-radio) days, it had the power to change the world.  But today?  Nothing stands a chance.  Jesus could return or aliens could land or zombies could rise from the grave, and if any of them wrote a book, most people would never even know it existed, much less read it, on their way to click on the next YouTube video.  Nothing could pull enough eyes away from the next news article algorithmically calculated to reaffirm their recorded opinions, keeping them from diverting their attention to anything challenging.    We're literally entertaining ourselves to complacency with those in power, and they've achieved a status quo no old-timey boss running a smear campaign in his pocket local newspaper could dream of: a populace in an entertainment coma, impossible to shock into action.
Bo looks like Newt Gingrich recounting to his grandchildren the story of the first time he saw a gay couple.
can also watch Food Inc (2008). It is a good documentary about food industry. Have abit on the worker part.
Meat producers abuse their workers...so lets not eat meat?! What about child slavery chocolate? How about sweatshop clothing? That banana you got in February...yeah, worker exploitation... Don't get me started on the diamond ring you ladies had to have.... How about the lithium in virtually everyone's smartphone...gonna have to put that down too!
I was wondering about the make up of the 454 dislikes on this video... I suspect that they are made up of meatpacking plant managers & corporate executives because they don't like being shown as heartless ghouls; the rest of the dislikes are from members of PETA because the segment was about poor treatment of humans and not poor treatment of animals.
I was a manager in manufacturing. I have more horror stories than this. All manufacturing is like this. And the state looks the other way. We all have to sign papers to work that do crazy things and they hire top notch HR legal.  I left after being bullied to the point that I suffer from severe depression and PTSD from their treatment because of i try to sue, they will destroy me. They protect those that encourage the cycle of destroying their employees that are working on the lines. It's far worst than what people think.  And me saying this much could get me sued as we sign paperwork in our orientation to never talk.

John and crew, it’s so good to have you back. Continue pulling back the curtain for the people.
Of course Johns answer to everything is "More Government".  Instead of that, how about just asking the already established agencies responsible for inspecting the things he describes to do their job?
Jeez!  What did all of You bleeding Heart liberal Karens expect from a Country that has been socio-economically raped repetitiously by a Republican Elite, that stands for nothing more than to enslave whoever doesn't fit into their World View?  I've been an legal Immigrant in the US in the 90's. Luckily enough I had legal Status and enough education to escape this dismal Circle of Economy.  I've left the US in '96.  My Son is now an undereducated, legal Immigrant in California and getting raped by American Corporate Culture, working in a Saw Mill, risking Life and Limb without legal Protection.  Smell the Coffee.
How can you say that the cruelty of factory farms has been talked about enough when you’ve never even talked about it on your show? If it were actually talked about “enough”, then it wouldn’t be as great an issue as it is. Do better John
I don't feel safe help help help help help help help help plesse
They left out the most important thing. He talked very well about Texas crisis.
Go vegan
And to think people used to make fun of me me for being a vegetarian and say that I only cared about animals, and not humans😒
Robot fucking the soup!hahaha
Dang ! ! !   If I can't raise my own meat then I need to be a vegetarian.  Problem is, even though I live in a rural environment, I can't. I'm more likely to take in rescue chickens and pigs than kill them.  I have at least a half dozen hens to old to lay eggs that are living out their golden years scratching in my garden.
I’m not sure but isn’t this the reason why companies would have to want to replace ppl with machines to do their jobs for them?
The American dream is a nightmare for most people in the U.S..

Corporate fines should double every time.
this is why we have and need regulation. this is why we need Union's. every time we leave big anything i.e food, tech, labor to their own devices this is what you get, a total f$%^ you mentality towards workers. i've seen it my entire life.
hey, where are the guys running around shouting something about "fair rights for workers are a sign of communism that is destroying America" ? yeah absolute exploit of your employees is the way god meant for this glorious nation be be run....
Stop eating meat.
6:50 Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is not a repetitive stress injury -- it's a congenital condition. I don't doubt that the repetitive work in a meat-packing plant can exacerbate symptoms of carpal tunnel, or cause it to progress faster than it would in workers in another field, but it won't *give* anyone carpal tunnel as the weight of current medical evidence indicates that carpal tunnel *is not caused by repetitive strain*. Work-related carpal tunnel is, according to current assessments, not a condition of causality -- i.e.: the work does not cause the condition -- but one of severity. Almost universally, those who show work-related symptoms would have developed carpal tunnel syndrome at some point in their lives, and the distinction between actual CTS and other, more common wrist/hand injuries like tendonitis, strains, and sprains in research is often poor-to-nonexistent.
I thought this was about pornhub
What can I as an individual do about this?  Other than stop eating meat I don't know what to do.
The jumbled address differently spoil because accordion distally serve off a intelligent signature. devilish, languid foam
slower lines, Less obesity
I was going to say I have missed the show but damn it always makes me realize even more how fucked life is lol.
And the GOP has been fighting tooth and claw to get legal protections from covid related issues for these companies
Sorry John I disagree. On my big board of favorite dames it's 1. Helen Mirren 2. Judi Dench. And I'll defend that to the grave.
I wish Oliver would end one of these segments by saying "Oh btw capitalism is trash".  Doing it like he does allows people to think that the issue is the particular CEOs like this ghoul, and not the system as a whole.
Don't buy from this corrupt and vicious industry, go vegan
How effective do you guys think becoming vegetarian helps with protesting the industry?
This isn't anything new. Ever read Animal Farm?
Very sad you can word by word translate this to german, exchange those company names and it will still be true - except for that funding for medical treatment stuff.
Never in my life have I heard anything good about Tyson. Not once! Chickens being boiled alive, their heads only being half cut off by machines. The contrast of the headquarter video made me nauseous. And ya, that 'pool' not bring the worst thing I've heard given that one doc. saying from Tyson plants and others Managers and Supervisors were/are raping immigrants and threatening them with deportation if they talk.   The workers at other companies that deal in cows and pigs torture them for amusement... It's disgusting. If you don't want to sleep for a couple of days... listen to one of those poor animals screams. Humans don't deserve this planet.
Love how a lot of these comments are people patting themselves on the back for going vegan, entirely missing the point. Some people have dietary needs that are best met with animal protein and boycotting the industry completely doesn’t help the impoverished workers because then the factories shut down and they have to move to another abusive warehouse or retail environment. We need National reform for things to change. One Susan giving up pork really doesn’t make a difference other than to make you feel self-righteous.
Short summary of tonight’s topic: America Meatpacking leadership, associate bathroom policy, and Tyson ranch chicken bites = “That’s disgusting”
We as a nation should go back to supporting our hardworking farmers. A lot of people in Maine are buying into co op farms and buying half cows pigs they butcher them and and you get fresh hormone free organic meats cost a bit more but you know who and where and how your meats are taken care of. Veggie co ops are good deals year round veggies grown outdoors and in winter in greenhouses.  I think this will become a trend with many people who are tired of all the food recalls
OUR government really sucks!  It really only works for the wealthy.
These companies are lagging like 100 years behind in work environment implementation - and therefore they lose the benefits thereof. Suckers.
If any group of people working at a factory that needs to unionize, it would be these people.
If they all quit, maybe the compony will rethink things? No, evil does not learn, they will just try to find new slaves. But what if they can't find new slaves? They may go bankrupt before they can get enough actual robots.
This hit really close to home, one of the articles even showed  the sign outside of the Tyson plant in my hometown of Lexington Nebraska. Not surprisingly, Tyson is the only reason that Lexington isn't a tiny backwater of only a few white families. At this point, the town's population is anywhere from 70-80% Hispanic, and I count my blessings that I was able to be raised around people who have much different outlooks and life experiences than me. However, after hearing about the horrific conditions in these meat-packing plants, I am left to wonder, what is the cost? How much were my friend's parents suffering as we went through school? How much has been left unsaid by the workers out of fear of losing their jobs? Something needs to change, fast. These immigrant families are the best that America has to offer, and they shouldn't be treated like disposable machines.
Americans only care about Twitter, Facebook, watching TV, worshipping celebrities, buying frivolous materialistic items and going into massive debt all in the hopes it all makes us feel better all the while allowing our environment, communities, and infrastructure fail and fall into major disrepair...but at least we have that Iphone and 70inch tv?
I can LITERALLY see the marketing agency that put together that monstrosity of ad highfiving each other: WE NAIL IT!
I switched this and vice around in my mind I saw that Guinea pig ad thinking this video was about the viagra epidemic... The horniest, angriest guinea pig I never saw before.

You know, if you guys went Vegan, this wouldn't be an issue
Aren't meatpackers unionized? If not, what are they waiting for?
Eye opening!!😢
people need to strike more in the US
Just goes to show my America needs to hold onto local delis.
Why don’t you just change your show to be called “updates on the horrors of capitalism“
This is why we desperately need workers unions
life's hard John, but would be harder on Mars
I have found that ANY company that totes the 'we treat our employees like family' line tend to be the worst employers. I'd hate be an actual family member.
Vegan, whole food plant based is the best way to go!
My god what a horrible country. Is this the beacon of freedom, or slavery? Fight for your rights America!
UNION UNION UNION UNION!!! Meatpacking industry needs many, many Norma Raes.  Also, beef up regulations and make fines huge and based on percentage of profits.
Betting pools bost moral.
Now days you are insane to believe that your employer cares about you, you are a number that number can be replaced. Quit thinking that they do. I don’t care what you do for a living. Everyone can be replaced no problem.
Everytime i cook pork it smells like piss anyhow. Tell me im wrong.
Why do people still eat this shit?
What can the average consumer do tho? I'd LOVE to vote with my money if I knew where there was better quality meat that isn't being processed off the backs of my fellow humans.
0:04  But... What was it you were 'Moving On' from, John? TELL US!!!
Perform an exorcism Jim..or GTF OUT OF THEIR HOUSE. LOOL His delivery always gets me.
My stepbrother works in this industry. Time to tell him to quit
All this could stop iff laws stopped workers being slaves for huge companies to rack in billions on the backs of those slaves will their billionaire owners become pedofiles under the corruption of the power that money brings!worjkers shouldn’t be slaves and owners shouldn’t be despotes walking all over the slaves backs ,there has to be a sweeter divide of the profits and gouvernments of the people should ake that obligatory!

You really think BIDEN cares about this? He's not gonna do shit for these workers
This world is run by a bunch of money hungry turds. Greed is the root to our destruction.
This is what happens when union culture dies. You have nothing to lose but your chains people!
This is why free market capitalism is inhumane, immoral, and only benefits the rich.
If work conditions weren't so terrible, where would you get people to join the military and become mass murderers for a couple dollars an hour.
Speaking about murderous rodents:  John Lydon of Sex Pistols fame had a violent hamster called Syd, named for Syd Barett of Pink Floyd.  Now, Syd the hamster once bit Lydon’s mate, John Simon Ritchie, on the finger, to which Ritchie exclaimed:  "Sid’s vicious!" And that’s how Sid Vicious got his name. True story. ~flies away~

Ah, fucking JBS. A guy I was helping with an eviction case had gotten a job there. He had previously lost his old job and fell behind on rent. JBS was his chance to make up the rent and stay in his apartment, but those assholes wouldn't give him the 10 minutes it would have taken to hop on a phone or computer to be heard by the judge to try and prevent his eviction.   I had to tell him the writ of restitution was issued last week. He looked like he was about to fucking cry.
To all who think redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor is socialism (I heared there are plenty of you in the US) consider how much wealth is distributed from the poor to the rich in such shameless ways. Every time you buy something on Amazon, you redistribute a part of your wealth to a billionaire for no good reason. Every time you buy cheap meat, you do the same. Every time you work for Tyson - well you also kinda give up on all your rights, too. Refusing to have measures against / counteracting this is just shooting one's own knee. This is only possible, because ordinary people are not organized in politics as well as billionaires are.
I wonder what would happen if someone wrote a book about this, and sent it to the president?  Is there an Upton Sinclair in the audience?
I'm guessing that class she's bragging about only has higher ups in it
The jokes were stale in this one.
If you work 52 weeks (51.724) @ $7.25 that's $15,000. So that man's life was literally valued at one year of work at minimum wage....just for perspective.
I've stopped eating meat. Beans are the way to go!
About 20 years ago, my mom in law was hired by a meat packing plant to teach ESL to their workers. She focused on safety measures. Not sure if they cared more about keeping workers safe or keeping plant open.
One of the things I learned while working on my business degree, is that those with money found they could make even more money by paying employees low wages, then make them pay (the rich) for housing, food, clothing, etc. than to keep slaves.  Now we are work slaves, many in worse shape than if they were slaves (homeless, foodless, hopeless).
Only one word describes these companies and politicians, and it's a word that seems woefully inadequate:  evil.
Zimmerman is doing what?!
Amazon...meat packing...What dipper based job will John tackle next?
Nothing like a snobby Brit trashing America. You hate it here so much why stay? Oh yeah, because as messed up as it is here, it’s still worse back in GB.
West michigan strikes again!!!!
what we need is fines based on the percentage of profits and jail time for the corporate policy setters, act stupid and get someone killed there goes half you profits and years of your life.. let it happen twice... no profit and forced staff change..
This will never happen. Thanks for dreaming john
We're THIS FUCKING CLOSE to bringing back the muck rakers
I really dont get why some americans still go around saying that the US is the best country in the world :S these kind of things are proof that they are closer to third world countries when it comes to working conditions, medical conditions and much more.. And i'm not talking about the MAGA ppl, but normal americans still think this...  Patriotism leads to nationalism that leads to fascism. You should always question your government to make sure that it always tries to improve.
John Oliver is the modern-day Upton Sinclair
The Jungle 2
Walmart calls you "family" 😖😒!
That's why I never understood the slogan, "keep America great?"
Now who finally takes the responsibility to fire these managers and CEOs that are responsible for such atrocities? I bet they would be more willing to give second thoughts if they learn they are vulnerable, too.
Another episode about the grim situation in a 3rd world country...
I got so used to John talking about the mainstream I'd forgotten about the obscure things he used to thrive on
Don’t worry guys the MINUTE they can replace factory workers with full automation or androids they will and all those people will be out of work. 😝 Joblessness is a great way to distract from neglectful business practices.
Companies really need to understand they are United States  CITIZENS not oligarchs. And these senates who take their money needs to be impeached and charged for treason.
I can attest to OSHA's uselessness I contacted them about a retaliation issue with Wells Fargo (a shitty evil company) they basically told me "right to work state, your problem not ours".
if and when i find that ginnie pig its dead it has bitten the best kind of doggos tail i am sick and tired of seeing doggos get bitten by stupid animals possed by demons
I'm from Malaysia and what i saw in the papers is US Sanctions on Top glove (cause of similar worker living/work conditions)... just shows how double standard the whites in America can be.
I hate this country...
Merika loves their corporate overlords! Even selfish Californians voted AGAINST their own workers. Completely disgusting.
I am not even from USA and almost feel physical pain from watching this.  Geh this was a brutal one.  Dont think we have anything just 5-10% as bad here in Denmark.   Unions will prevent that instantly for sure.
Daaamn..
Ty for opening my eyes to how unfunny this show is without the laf-track
thx
When you're a foreigner and a vegetarian but still watch this anyway cause it's informative and funny
USA is a wired place ,
The American dream ?
Capitalism amirite
The most ruthless capitalist economy not treating workers as humans? Yeah, shocking ...
Worked for Tyson for years. This story is absolutely spot on.
Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle in 1906 describing the U.S. meat packing industry abusing immigrant workers. Maybe in another 100 years things may change for the better.
Go vegan. If you don’t, YOU are causing this.
Welp someone already made a comment about uptown Sinclair.
Am I the only one double tapping to skip the jokes?
I used to work in a pork processing plant, I have been stabbed.  I saw a gal get her tendon cut on her hand then sent back on the line.  I saw a fella take the skin off the palm of his hand on a skinner machine, and return to work the next day.  The "nurse's" solution for anything, "put black salve on it".
It's getting increasingly hard to justify eating meat. The animals suffer in horrific factory farm conditions, the farmers themselves are functionally indentured servants of the agri-corps, the meat packing industry employees are literally dying on the job and to top it all off meat production is a major contributor to carbondioxide in the atmosphere. All that because we won't give up eating steaks and chicken nuggets.
Ever notice how oliver always brings up race in every segment?
Thank god papa you’re back - I’ve been having nightmares without you by sweet English Prince
It’s sad that your family is 4th on your list, that’s what’s wrong. And get real that’s the way factories have operated forever, everyone knows it, sorry still better than Bill Gates mushroom food. Hope I die before this happens.
That’s why I only eating Halal :)
Who wants to tell John his desire to be an immersion blender is just a description of water boarding?
the greediest, most callous people run the world. whoever is best at exploiting the most people are the ones in power and it has always been this way.
That’s just an empirical fact lol
Leave it to this mad British version if John Cena to talk about something NO ONE talks about and makes me angry at something I should’ve been angry at for years
Nothing of what he said would be done this is murica do you realy expect change lol
If people try to bribe you with 10k to sign off on something that's worth BILLIONS to them...you're a cheap cheap number, man.  "you wanna save money by being a bastard and bending ethics? Pay me half of what you'd spend to be a responsible employer! Bribery isn't cheap!"
How many Americans are vegetarians?
“They do seem to care about the physical well-being of SOME of their workers” Incoming clips of white people doing yoga [edit: yep, I was right]
We need our labor unions and labor laws to be so much stronger
Y'all were today years old when you learned that Kansas has something called a "Beef Triangle". It consists of 3 cities in southwest Kansas that are home to many beef packing plants, who changed their line operations bc of the Pandemic. It's why Wendy's ran out of meat last spring. It's also why John didn't bring up Cargill or National Beef.    If you really want to help, stop eating meat. Now, we just have to solve the immigration problem; Cargill pays $20 an hour, in CASH, to it's plant workers. They stand in long lines to send half of their pay home to Mexico every Friday. How will all who read this and complain about the cost of living/no jobs react? NOBODY *WANTS* TO WORK AT CARGILL. ~A Vegan of 20 years
Mr Oliver. Come on. This is such a boring subject. Can't you do drugs or something?
I will never but anything from Tyson again! Fuck those people!
i hope he does cancel culture next
And they wonder why so many people are jaded about capitalism without regulation.
America is horrifying
Tyson seems to closely resemble Joseph Fritzl's family.
The month before you came back was a long month  : (
Well what do you expect to happen in a country run by companies and not a goverment thats why im glad i dont live in this piece of shit country
Bo Pilgrim looks like the guy from Hannibal  "It was my salvation Agent Starling"
"So what is it we can do?"  Liberté, égalité, fraternité...
When the hell are Americans going to wake up and realise that they live in a third world country?
Oh, goodie! I almost forgot this was tonight. Now I can't wait to see what existential crisis the angry tucan sends me on tonight!
Oooof John Oliver went for the jugular with that list of what's important to me 😂😂 called out
Ok boys and girls have we learned why deregulation is a bad thing yet? When you defund and deregulate this is what you get. Trump went out of his way to destroy OSHA, FDA, and other safety organizations. This is what happens when workers are treated like replaceable garbage. They know if someone dies or quits there's 10 people waiting to take the job.
These are the same companies that will spend $ millions on anti-union campaigns. When will Americans learn from history, the only time we’ve all benefited from a big “middle class” is when “Unions” were there strongest, the 50’s & 60’s!!!! Natl. Business Roundtable🖕👎🖕👎
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah Panic! XD
One word: Organize!
"Meat. It's what I technically am to any animal above me on the food chain like,..." Adam Driver?
its a heavily price driven business. its very unlikely that everyone from the packers to the farmers supplying the feed arent going to continue to be squeezed
I love this show, but every  time I watch it I get a bit closer to depression.
united states is soooooo fucked up
And what is all this for: the greed of people buying tons of cheap, low quality meat. Don't buy this stuff, folks!  It is ridiculous how this industry "protects" people from knowing what the true background of the product is. I bet no one would eat that stuff if presented the way these animals are raised, fed, butchered, and processed.
13:43 73% of salaried employees are white. Meanwhile 75% of U.S. population is white. I don't see the problem here. I agree the next statistic is concerning, but not the first.
Real victim blaming lol
I wonder, what would these companies do without immigrants?
BREAKING NEWS  THIS JUST IN:  HUMANS SUCK
When a company starts calling it’s employees “family”, RUN!!!
Cut back on your meat consumption by just a little in order to offset the cost of supporting your local butcher and give these psychopaths one fucking big finger.
In all defense of Tyson they did hold a mirror to the nose of people interviewed for management positions. I am not saying what the results where but they did.
Fire them all and replace them with actual robots?
I wish John would play Owl in Winnie the Pooh
After 4 jobs that were borderline abusive, I've made it a rule. At the interview I will ask "how does this company feel about their employees?". If the answer involves the word "family" anywhere in it, im not taking the job.  Family means that they expect you to drop everything for them. They will chew you up and spit you out and then move on to a new poor fool without a second thought. It means they will fire you for the smallest slight and make up some bullshit reason so you can't fight back.  If you can, avoid any place that calles their employees family.
John you missed the Biggest, Con-Agra....When I worked at a cold storage facility, we took bets on the new hires, would they make it to 1st break before slithering out the back door when they went to take a piss...LOL...We processed 'offal' meat for pet foods and is was not exactly an aromatic experience....And I was Workman's Comp'd from injury on the job, contributed by 'speed' freaks(yes, heads and boozers too) on the line....(our product was contracted for Gerber Foods)...And also beef cartilage for conversion to joint replacement use, processed initially by us, sent a town over for firing into powder, then shipped to Spain for processing, and then shipped to worldwide Hospital's for joint cartilage replacement surgeries....
I worked at Tyson Meats from 2014-2017  and still have nightmares about it. I wasn't even on the floor, I was in the microbiology lab
I hear you and agree. BUT, when it comes to companies and their horrific actions it is mainly US that is to blame. Ask people which they want, cheap chicken or better working environments for immigrants. Are they willing to pay $25 a pound for chicken? You want good roads? Willing to pay $10 a gallon for gas as the gas tax pays for them? These companies like Tyson function the way we want them to because we want cheap products. It is our fault, not theirs.
If you understand double entry accounting,  you understand how the world works.
Also Americans stop eating meat from factory farms.  edit: Boca burgers taste just like beef.
I hate that people act like “this isn’t our country” due to their own ignorance of EXACTLY how the US is. Welcome to the party ma’am!
Corporations treat people like shit, while ceo's and president soak up the money
i think I'l have falafels 4 lunch
I’m definitely left speechless after that. Horrifying. No one should have to work under those conditions.
We had a meatpacking company in our county. It was known for its turn around...also people being traumatized who worked on the "kill floor". Yep all animals have to be killed first.
Reminds me of Monty Python the killer rabbit. Lol
A few years ago, I worked at a small local business in a red state. I was badly burned at work when driving a very old utility vehicle with faulty repairs. Part of it exploded. I was unable to work anywhere for a full month as a result, and the company refused to pay worker's comp until I got a lawyer involved. And even still, they fought tooth and nail against paying me. The faulty vehicle has still not been retired and is in constant danger of hurting another employee. Fuck capitalism.
Yet another reason to stop eating meat.
Slow down the line speed by about 1000%.
Didn’t everyone have to read the jungle in high school?
So basically John Oliver said, “hey I got an idea for some riveting television. How about we do a piece on the meat packing industry and show that it isn’t any better sense the book “the jungle” was published that showed the terrible and discussing conditions in meat plants in the 1800s. I’m sure it will have the same effect to spearhead some kind of new legislation or at least make people want to 🤮 “
We were fined more than the average at a poultry plant for a single instance of someone seen driving a forklift not wearing the seatbelt.
Apparently NB and Cargill payed, but Tyson and JBS didn't.
Look into the SHARP program in Kansas and similar programs in other states. It's blatant bribery to avoid following guidelines. A way to buy your way out of being inspected.n
Please boycott the meat industry and go vegan. We can reduce suffering for a lot of humans and animals.
It's what you get for working in a horrific torture industry made for animals.
It's a sad commentary on the state of our media that the best investigative journalists these days are all comedians. CNN, fox and the networks should all be ashamed, very ashamed.
That's it!!... I just became a vegan.
Great, now do Amazon!!
How many times did IBP(Iowa Beef Packers) get busted for hiring illegals(undocumented workers)? That's how they started treating people like shit. They always knew that once immigration left they could hire again and the fines were so small it was just part of doing business. They knew they could abuse their workers. I'm sorry but part of me wants to see ALL of these major industries fail. I can buy from locals and grow my own. Probably better that pissy chicken.
I love how I'll see whatever this man tells me to see every monday. Im here my man, I'll always be here.
I know even more horrid stories at another meatpacking plant company, just pm if you want to hear it.
OSHA doesn't do anything for workers. I got a concussion at Cracker Barrel due to managements refusal to replace a safety latch. Worker's comp called me to asked a series of questions while recording then turned the recording off to say "we are not concerned about your pain or suffering" (OSHA, 2019)
"Why I'm Vegetarian 101"
Suppose Green Bay is gonna change the name of the Packers now.
I don't eat rotting flesh doggie.
Who knew there work so many pigs in meatpackaging
Thank you for this!
Auctioning off a gun you used for a hatecrime..legally... Nah, sorry, america...in many ways, you're still a shi7hole even now that the big pooper is gone
If any of you think the government is going to step in and do the right thing, don't hold your breath.
Cover the insurrection please
no no no, i'm sorry John Oliver, you are just making shit up as you go, this is not possible, it cannot be real!  in the best coutry ever to exist on this planet? no way!
I want my chicky nuggies, but not at the cost treating your hourly workers like dogs.
I would bet money that there are absolutely people ground up in some of that beef somewhere in the last decade.
Every single American needs to decide on one day a week to not eat meat. That would impact the ENTIRE world; from the rainforest in brazil, to the streets in Iraq, more than ANYTHING else that can be done.
Sad to see so little has changed in the 117 years since Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle"
Companies will spend $50 million on ads to tell you they donated $1 million to a charity
This is why we need unions.
I live in a town where Cargill has lots of plants and I fucking hate them they smell awful literally the whole town smell like dog food half the time
I'm glad John Oliver took the time to highlight some unacceptably atrocious working conditions in this industry and call out the corporate gaslighting of employees and the public. However, I think in addition to the federal regulations suggested in this segment, it is even more important to push for laws and educational campaigns that allow the reinstitution of widespread unionization in the USA. Only with unions do workers have the means to guarantee their own safe working conditions, regulatory agencies on their own are vulnerable to corruption and oversight. Unfortunately employees struggling to find time for bathroom breaks isn't uncommon in american workplaces these days, and not just for the meat packing industry.
Where the hell did they learn to put boxes on OSHA inspectors's heads? Skyrim!!?! 😲😲😲
The meat is going down the conveyor belt covered in piss and panic shit and adrenaline-laced blood, and you worry about a guy taking his gloves off to take a leak.
Smithville is a Chinese owned company now! I don't buy any of these products, only locally owned, organic. Buy local, support small farmers!
There’s no such thing as a medium aggressive pigeon. They’re all blood thirsty monsters.
This is so disgusting. Good fucking reason to boycott these companies and not eat meat anymore.
Vote with your dollar, don't purchase from these companies.
A fine example of capitalism being built on the backs of poor people
No sound
"Mary had a little lamb, and when she saw it sicken, she took it off to packing town, and now it's labeled chicken" It's been >40 years since I read "the Jungle", and I will never forget that poem or the book.
Read Upton Sinclair "The Jungle" 1906 same awful conditions just 115 years earlier. Same stuff happening?  Growth for the sake of growth. Only tumors, viruses, and capitalism do that. Capitalism. Cancer of humanity, creator of extraordinary greed.The cost? Compassion. Exsistance. All life on Earth. Death because of greed, thank you capitalism.
Meat factories are sounding a LOT like prison labor camps...
History is a cycle we are back to the Jungle
With apologies to Brian Cage: Meatpacking employees are men, *not machines*
Best country in the world 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
As a former perdue worker I can attest they use immigrants as tools, not humans. Fuck the perdue company.
Corporate America is the best 👍🏻
we live in a propaganda state. Not a free country.
As a blue collar worker, I’m so glad the dangers of sitting down are finally being brought to light. I’m so happy about it that my back will maybe stop hurting.
This isn’t jus meat packing. This idealogy is spreading to the rest of corporate America. Keep fighting comrades
Hearing what's happening in 3rd world countries these days makes me sad
I wonder how beyond burger treats its employees?
Any company say " we are family " , I know by heart it is the killing the weak and eat the sick kind of family
Oh, but how to solve these issues? And all the pandemics coming from animals? And factory farming? And environmental destruction? And the health care? And... Just shut up and go vegan already :D
We read & watched the horrid conditions in packing plants in last Spring. Plants were  COVID-19 factories. McConnell wanted to protect owners with no liability they the last 2020 relief bill. No way Jose'. Me? I protect everyone thru double masks, essential business only,  only 3 folks may enter my home, clean hands, and...don't eat meat.
Fun fact: despite being called cheese heads, the Green Bay Packers are actually named for meat packers!
Meat industry on its self is disgusting. what did ppl expect?
or, yanno, stop eating meat
More reasons to go plant-based... 🧐
A lot of these problems would be solved by universal healthcare.
Today in a new episode of "horrors of full-on capitalism"...
The reason Tyson & similar companies get away w/this is because they can legally bribe the politicians‼️ For their re-election donations these same politicians deliberately understaff  OSHA ‼️
Being flamed for not having much meat during the pandemic meat shortage even after explaining that meat plants have been hit hard makes me doubt much of America actually cares. Tbh, any outage from imported products that come from hard hit areas to reduced flower options for Valentine's day because planes were being used for vaccines was met more with anger than understanding. Personally, I'm pretty disgusted with America these days.
Hell in TN veterans (like me) who have service connected injuries from the service cannot get legal representation and since they have a preexisting condition any injury recieved is a derivative of that injury - even if factually this isn't true. Workmens Comp in Republican States is anti-veteran and anti-worker.
A little over a hundred years ago, journalist Upton Sinclair wrote a book called "the Jungle", that exposed unsafe and unsanitary practices in the Chicago area meat packing industry.
An 8pc cut on chicken only takes about 1-3 seconds a bird when you have a chicken cutter. Just saying.  Don't listen to someone who knows nothing about the job criticize the job.  I was safely cutting chickens up when I was 13 working in a meat shop. Its been 17 years an now I train all new meat cutters for the company I work for. 2 seconds is plenty.
... And that's why you need universal health care, so you can be cured no Metter how shitty is your employer, even if you are an illegal immigrant with no contract. How could be considered civilized a country where you have to choose beetwin be treated or sue you employer. In a system like that you will never get a better treatment because the employer would never give a fuck because they are not afraid of closing the plant due to  security standards enfringement.
Possible solution nobody would consider is to start your own farm, and raise your own animals for meat. Chickens are surprisingly low maintenance. Either for eggs or for meat. But you will want to harvest most birds for meat within one year of hatching otherwise the meat gets pretty stringy and is really only good for soup or stews.
I worked for the unemployment dept. we had many of Tyson's employees file after they had had an injury, released from doctors,  returning back to work who who then fired. The workers involved were refugees who spoke little English who were left injured for life. After leaving the depart I saw workers at the orthopedic doctor. I attempted to speak to them and the office employee prevented me from doing so. I hear now Tyson has their own rehabilitation facility. I talked to someone in Waterloo and they said it was the same there.
welp, now I'm gonna buy as much of my meat as i can from local butcheries as opposed to those monsters
Treated like family, means underpaying, guilt tripping and forcibly working those you feel are subordinate to you,  just like parenting.
Having lots of money is truly a wonderful thing.
Oh ok. So this is the day I get grossed out into vegetarianism.  EDIT: Dodged that bullet. Now all I have to be is a socialist. I can manage that.
Something kind of sad to think about: Yeah, maybe the US is pretty bad, but keep in mind that at least half of the world is worse.
This makes me think about the W.H.O saying that China isn't the source of the outbreak. These meat packing plants sound like a breeding ground for disease.
USA Workers looking N Chinese Worker - 🥲😐
Another new Last Week episode!  Another day started with intermittent fits of rage, laughter, and tears...
Notice all the meat industry people are grossly obese. Eating meat is sooo unhealthy on sooo many levels☹️🙀🥵
"This has been A Closer Look"
Does anyone know of a humane source of chicken? I don’t want to support these companies with my dollars anymore
Remember when he use to be funny? Yea neither do I lol
well well... this kind of report will help to speed up the change to automation and problem solved...... thousands jobless and no labor laws issues
John Oliver is a commie pos
Ah yes, america. The world's richest third world country
When you focus attention on trump for 4 years. You forget about all the other shit that's going on. Wow we have a lot to clean up. What can I do to help?
The Jungle needs to be distributed for free.
Brah!! Love the show, keep up the good work. You should do one on Bestbuy!
The fact that the talking head newscasters seemed more concerned about the worker peeing while he was on the line, rather than the fact that he couldn't take a proper pee break, just proves that TV news outlets are just corporate shills.
Dark mode john Oliver. PLEASE
I'm literally watching this video waiting to pour concrete at a Purdue farms meat packing plant. Wow.
Listen to the TAL episode where they hide the undocumented workers on the roof while the USDA makes one of its (rare) inspections.  Capitalism is criminal.
That divorce gag at 10:35.. I felt that :|
Modernized slavery with few extra steps.
Upton Sinclair is rolling in his grave.
I'm becoming more and more convinced that John is a socialist waiting for the opportunity to reveal it without risk of harsh backlash
To think nothing really has changed since Upton Sinclair wrote the book “The Jungle” is truly depressing.
Aren't we Americans tired of this corporate bullshit? Don't yall just wanna go apeshit every now and then?
"Put a box on your head" is among the most ridiculous things I've heard today. They're literally trying to fool the OSHA inspector the same way I rob a store in Skyrim.
This is what happened when they convinced the American workers that they don't need unions for multiple industries/locations.
couldnt they just sign the waiver and then claim it's invalid because it was signed under duress?
Just started this, but I worked at a chicken processing plant once. One night literally traumatized me. I couldn't force myself out the door the next night.
Go Vegan
Me seeing the video title thinking, finally a video that's not about corona. 1:40, it's gonna be (partly) about corona isn't it. 2:43, dammit.
Seeing a lot of parallels with UPS here.  A piece on wage slaves like myself (i.e. not the drivers who make bank but the pre-loaders and other part timers who get paid half as much and frequently have our hours cut) would be honestly amazing, and our building in particular isn't nearly as bad as others.
Whoever believes slavery was abolished around the world should watch John Oliver's show more often. This system sells itself as freedom based but it's the furthest thing from truth anyone could've ever  had imagined. This is going on in the country that promotes itself as The Land of The Free, sure... free to piss and shit in your adult diapers so you can pay the rent for a shitty roof over your head. This needs to change ASAP.
I keep coming back to LWT when there is a new upload, and it never ceases to amaze me how fucking broken America is and how brutally fucked workers are in every possible way
Lmao, 2 months of a Biden presidency. 0 John Oliver videos over him. Let’s see how long this goes.
The new slavery era.
Never forget Trump signed an executive order absolving these corporations of liability as a solution to keeping plants open instead of finding ways to distance employees or, instead of bailing them out for more money than was given in aid to the rest of americans, investing in programs for smaller scale local packing facilities to generate jobs, reduce risk, improve quality, and bring stability to the economy.  Such a good businessman and leader.
It's the same here in Germany. Who would have thought that companies who make profit from the exploitation of animals would exploit humans as well, what a shock.
Not that the Meatpacking industry has ever had moral processing but if the leaders of the country can't accept the truth don't speak the truth how can you expect the super-rich to be any different
Fines and lawsuits don't hurt corporations in the slightest. They just raise prices and carry on being twats. How to fix it? Take the fines and settlements out of shareholder's pockets.
Upton Sinclair rolling in his goddamn grave
Seriously, Oliver? What can we do? Stop eating meat. Then it will go away.
The corporate office was also... All white people.
Made me think of the Gainesville Georgia plant that shut down after multiple people died from a gas leak.
We missed you, John. Because we value you so much, we understand you need paid vacations and a healthy work environment, so we will understand all future absences as necessary recharge opportunities. Welcome back. Keep speaking the the truth.
but butt butt you see now the thing is about going to Harvard, are you educated enough to jump a jetski over the statue of liberty,<3 sko new brunswick <3 best stand up show of my life chi John
And Congress will do... nothing I assume? Maybe call these companies up and ask for a bribe so they continue to do nothing?
It's not Trump related? Am I daydreaming?
Our neighbor who works at Tyson lives and with his grandfather. The grandfather died of covid early in the pandemic. 100% Tyson responsible IMO.
Those people throwing that guinea pig gave me anxiety. I know it's fake but still.
The USA are treating workers like cattle and the mentally ill like vermin. They're willing to destroy everyone's health and theirs, just to keep shoveling poisoned garbage into their mouths. I'm not a fan of arbitrary morals but I just can't withhold my literal disgust at such a society and the fact that they're holding us all at gun point.
Thank you so much for these videos! Excellent work.
Having an angry British person yell at me about the ways that we are screwing ourselves over is pretty relaxing to be honest.
Dont bring your own steak. The revolution will not be with meat.
We treat our workers like family, one chased by the voracious hamster that serves as a metaphor for the incessant demand from America sating its meat lust and from employers seeking greater profits.
Damn those Tyson employees are thiccc. What do they do all day? Nothing of course.
I mean, if we’re gonna be all the way real, the only way you hurt these companies is with a lowered demand; thus severely disrupting their profits. Sooooooooo going Vegan is a thing.     No condemnation if you still eat meat (for real, nobody is going to hell for eating a chicken sandwich).    But if we eat meat (given what we know about the conditions of workers, the alleged corrupted relationships between these companies and law making politicians, and the way that the animals are treated in this industry) you can’t avoid the truth about how that chicken sandwich/hamburger came to be.
I have generally found that the way a food business treats the animals and the soil is the same way  business treats the humans they employ.  Read The Jungle by Upton Sinclair. This stuff has been happening for years.  Buy from small, local markets.  Look for B-Corporations and CSAs (community supported agriculture) and farmer's markets.
What the fuck
It is illegal to film in slaughterhouse so all of this is no surprise. If you dont think corporations own this country you haven't been paying attention.
Lol. My family is worthless.
We finally get to hear about John's sex life
Congratulations USA for reaching 500,000 deaths due to covid-19, but don't worry the flu still kills more people every year.
Me before the video: heh... Meatpacking...  Me after the video: oh, that's horrible... Heh... Meatpacking.
Sadly as long as the CO. is making money and buying politicians, nothing will change
The French did what had to be done!
OMFG!!!!  And everybody from all around the world is looking at USA as you are the lighthouse of democracy and justice.... :(  This is so fu***** frustrating because the russian alternative is not even an alternative :(  All in all... so lucky to be born in Europe 🇪🇺!!! (Even though we have the same story here.... at some level.... in some countries).
You know what, let's do $15 minimal federal wage. Either it will mean these workers at least get a decent pay for their hard work in horrible environments or it will mean the company will invest in ways to automate the labor in order to save money. Either outcome seems like a win to me.
Soo hows that list for Judy Dench's family?
When is he going to talk about Epstein? Seems very weird to me that he hasn't.
Maybe we should stop eating meat? It’s disgusting.
I’m a third generation rancher and this issue is a huge reason why we are losing all our family farms. We cannot compete against huge multinational corporations exploitation of LITERAL SLAVE LABOR. We are losing $500/head while TYSON MAKES $900!!!
John are you trying to turn me vegetarian because with these last two episodes I'm starting to feel more vegetarian
We’re just not gonna talk about the Uighurs anymore... waiting on that update since ya know, America ain’t gonna help.
"...a blank, 10,000 check..."  Hey, dude on newsclip:  If a check is blank, it means it is not filled out with the amount.  If a check has $10,000, it is not blank.
I just think it's interesting that john fails again at telling people to reduce their meat consumption. These conditions are that way because consumers don't care and demand these products. Last week was about how the pandemic is a zoonotic disease, but the only conclusion was something about finding diseases early and not going into bat caves instead of reducing the demand for meat in general and especially factory farmed meat. You vote with your money people. I know john said he could never go vegan in an episode a year or so ago and I'm not at all saying he or anybody needs to go vegan or vegetarian instantly, but telling people to decrease their meat consumption is really not that hard.
I went into this assuming something would make me feel nauseated. What I wasn’t expecting was that it would be betting on employees getting COVID.
John Oliver for president!
CaPiToLiSm WoRkS
I'm glad you brought this up. Having to take a piss below a factory line is not disgusting it's bloody denigrating and desperation! They used to say shit rolls down hills...but to be fair here ....it's breaking the law of physics!
love it how this show turns the spotlight on other problems than the others... It is heartbreaking to watch states going down while baited to their death with fake patriotism
John Oliver is now the confirmed reincarnation of Upton Sinclair.
So it’s basically “The Jungle” all over again.
This is why in Japan where I live, I never buy american meat even if its price is 30% of the japanese one.
Wow i live in 3rd world country, but at least worker in my plant can go to toilet or go to see the doctor anytime they want. In Indonesia its an obligation to have doctor in your clinic as your worker reach certain amount, and as a management we never involved whether the worker need further treatment at the hospital, its all the doctor decisions. And hospital treatment cost is covered by with the mandatory insurance worker. In here we can see US is an example capitalism at it finest ... And its not pretty ...
The USA really are one of the worst countries in the world. 😱
Nah. I have no sympathy for anyone who contributes to killing and mutilation of innocent beings. Truly don't care.
The US is officially a third world dump.  When is the revolution?  Personally I would had joined the mob to lynch bill gates after he pulled Covid vaccine from public domain and into his choice of private pharmaceutical, but we have to many anti-vaxers to even care.    I never imagined a world so hopeless... and I have lived around the world. I have seen some some truly horrible human conditions. Now it seems there no running from it. Even worst, no will to do anything about it.
IF someone tried to bribe me EVER and gave me a blank $10,000 USD check I would 100% cash it AND do the exact opposite of what they wanted me to do.
John Oliver consistently makes me care about issues I never thought about. He is a voice we can trust for sure.
Yay John is back ❤  Unfortunately, that means he's probably going to ruin something I love...
Having to wear an adult diaper on the line because your employer doesn't provide enough bathroom breaks is not just disgusting, it reduces your earnings potential (assuming your employer isn't paying for it).  On the bright side, if you work multiple meat packing jobs so that you have sufficient income to justify itemizing, it should be a tax deductible expense.  The better paid members of your "family" may be able to provide you with more information.
Meat company CEOs and owners should be arrested and put through their own plants.  I mean as employees of course.
Dammit, another reason to not eat meat.  But seeing as how humans only evolved to have the large brains 🧠 that we have, by eating meat, synthetic meat will eventually dominate the market.
After working 6months at Hatfield slaughterhouse. not surprised.  Work 11 hours a day, And was told we only get a break because its the law 😂. We all have carpal tunnel, and the immigrants are scared to go to the Dr. for their carpal tunnel. I tried to explain to them that its the law, but there is NO way to communicate that with them. There are also 0 cameras lol.
So dont work there? Why are they helping poor animals be tortured?
One word: DELAWARE
To management the only difference between workers and product one is able to use a knife.
There needs to be an overhaul on how much government getting involved in state regulations! Government and business should not be too separate.
No question the company is shit, but this video and the one before are completely missing the point here. It seems like they are more concerned about the conditions of the company, rather than attacking the industry fundamentally. It's like he only focuses on regulations instead of the ethical issue at hand. He didn't even mention the people that actually have to slaughter the animals, day in and out, nor the people who have to handle animals at farms. The job itself has a huge detrimental psychological impact and there are no regulations that will change that. It is wrong to exploit animals and humans for a product we dont need. The whole blame is being shifted to the company, instead of the consumers which are the reason this company exists. Consumers have to be accountable for their decisions.  Why the hell would you support an industry that is fundamentally exploitative in the first place?  It's sad and disturbing watching people trying to find ways to justify really horrible treatment of others.
Ah, yes - the sequel to Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle."
Yuk!  Almost makes you yearn for Soylent Green.
Father Oliver: "If you ate meat today, it likely went through one of these plants." Me: *A person who hates meat but ate fish yesterday* ... Well, I guess I'm fully vegan now.
Reminds of the mention of the book the Jungle in 8th history and meat factories in the early 1900’s. Still yuck and workers need better working conditions always.
i dont know what has happened bud but you just are not funny anymore.. but i DO love how you make it easier to learn about what is actually going on, just have to watch out for bias but other than that..
And I thought Amazon workers had it bad.
How old school! ...and terrifying.
Now Biden is president , Oliver will hardly make a video on his lapses.
10:10 “A bribe or an illegal  campaign contribution”  Or!?
Goddamn, I thought upton sinclair the jungle was supposed to be a century ago.
How convenient,  a "family" doesn't need to unionize..
That betting pool is something I’d wish they do at my job in the bottled water industry. We’re only at 3 for my plant.
283 is super low. Pr department active.
John Oliver, doing what you do best and loving every minute of it! Keep hammering home those hard truths!
It took me three minutes to realize what you said about Miss Piggy and had to rewind to make sure I heard it right.  The best and most disturbing joke I've heard so far this year and it was said so casually that I almost missed it.
I'm not vegan/vegetarian, but this is a pretty good incentive to boycott anything to do with the meat industry, cutting down meat consumption would just be the first step.
America- the latest 3rd world country.
I really fucking hate "moving on" as an intro. What are we moving on from JOHN YOU JUST STARTED THE VIDEO
Mexie also has a great video on this
Conclusion: good thing I already am a vegetarian. 👀 Thank you, John, but you forgot the highlight: "On the other hand, I would enjoy being a chicken if Adam Driver would pluck me personally..." *incoming call* "Driver: "What the hell?? I thought we had talked about this?" "Erm..." "Do you want me to come over and beat you up?" "Yes! Please do that!"
Insert John Oliver resembling perverted owl jokes here:
Ssoinda like someone put in the blood code at a Tesla factory.
USA maybe should bring democracy in America like it does everywhere.
Hello 👋
3:00 yep that's my state. I think the worse part if that most of our very slim black population lives in Waterloo and I'm 80% sure the supervisor in question is white
John needs to use the "that is disgusting" gal throughout the season on unrelated topics.
The government should provide loans to these workers so they can buy the factories and run them themselves
Yeah, I immediately turn down a job when they say we're a family.  I've worked for family before.  It means you're expected to work more, for less, and not complain about it until you get home.
In the end, all this video will change, is that a few extra bribes will change hands. If anything. Yes im pessimistic.
14:35 it looks so artificial 😬 way too red
While this information is quite sad and disturbing, it is by no means surprising. We live in a country where greed and corruption are so common place, and love and compassion for one another are nearly relics of the past. Companies are not all to blame, if the people did not demand so much animal flesh for their consumption, we would not even have this story to listen to. I am not absolving evil companies from their responsibility; however, we are also to blame. You can vote with your dollar and not buy animal flesh for food. It is good for no one, no animals, and not even the planet. Vegan is the way.
That's why both US and China along with Russia should really burn in hell
It's pretty grim, when even ruskies have better worker safety than usa
Meatpacking factories were the biggest outbreaks of covid in Europe. Bad working conditions, crowded lodgings for the workers, mostly immigrants were a perfect storm. Everyone saw it coming early on and still the owners did nothing to avoid it.
How long has it been since John did a main segment that wasn't Drumf or Covid related?
a whole episode on packing meat without a single joke about adam driver, im proud.
Replace them all with robots. Problem solved.
I used to work for Smithfield.. that Company is borderline Slavery.  Mandatory overtime 12 hours a day, 6-7 days a week.   People dying on the line and everyone around has to keep working while the paramedics take the body away....   30 minute lunch break, where the only place you are allowed to eat is the cafeteria, which is a 10 minute walk from the production floor to the cafeteria located in the building across the parking lot... Then you have to wait in a line, 1000 hungry workers long, and *hope* you get to grab some food so that you can at least eat it on the 10 minute walk back to the floor..  that place was hell.
I don't no if this has been said but, read a book called The Jungle by Upton Sinclair
Too bad there isn’t a way to organize and have a voice at work, those greedy unions are a terrible thing.
Corporations have become nations without boarders. They only care for there like selves and everyone else is expendable. Humans have been doing this for years the only difference now is its easier. People just use human lives to fatten there pockets its sad how this shit is brought up and shortly dismissed. We as a species might want to look at this before we extinct ourselves, we value physical (wealth)over life(sustainability of species) kind of amusing if you think about it.
"No one ever talks about the grim conditions humans face in meatpacking facilities"... Vegans. Vegans have been talking about this issue for decades. Natalie Portman made a whole ass documentary on it 4 years ago. Hey John, next can you cover how animal agriculture is forcing America's farmers into a neoliberal class of feudalist serfs?
Always the small fish that gets shafted by the big fish
The aloof comma preferably carve because north america enzymatically yell from a bitter trouble. lively, cynical australian
Of course he made a statue of himself reading a Bible. Like Jesus always said, fuck the poor and the needy, kick the sick in the face, bribe the rabbi, and rob your neighbor.
America is a disgusting country. We have to fix this disgusting shit. We are so far from the best country on earth. We could be that great if we actually tried to end this evil. No country can be great when it tolerates evil like this.
These are the kind of jobs that Unions were made for, the government can't regulate some industries and the workers have to stand up for themselves.
You do realize the simple solution the companies are gonna do right?  "They treat us like human machines, doing the same task on the same slice of pork."  Machines dont get covid, file lawsuits or need breaks.
So we're complaining about meatpackers to get us used to eat that fake meat stuff bill gates was talkin about?
Please make a video on our profitable prison/jail system.
I fully agree with the idea that these meat packing factories need to be reformed like crazy, those working conditions are entirely unacceptable and the fact that it even got to this position is horrifying, but think about what an emergency mandate for social distancing is gonna do. You saw how close those people are packed in there, so to socially distance they'd have to reduce the number of workers on the line by at least half, possibly up to 80-90%.  That's a lot of people losing their jobs or having their hours greatly reduced. Which in combination with the fact that the US government has done a great big fuck all in terms of compensation ($2,000 should be enough to survive for a full year, right?), as well as the fact that many of these workers are immigrants (legal and illegal) who would be hesitant to request support from the government means you could end up potentially doing more damage than the virus.  p.s I would like to add that all of these subsequent problems are caused by the fact that the US is a racist hyper capitalist state and if they were a little bit less racist and actually cared about the wellbeing of their citizens then adding a social distance mandate wouldn't be the devastating blow that it is.
These people should also face prison time for allowing these sort of conditions at these plants. 😡
This country isn’t going anywhere unfortunately. Trumps stupid voters still think that Trump helped these people and did everything right.   Hopefully he forms his third party to fracture the vote
And the US classify other countries for categories of slave labour and exploitation
Meat packing being a family activity seems more like a frat house.
This is Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle" all over again. We never learn.
This terrible, but if these jobs were automated away it would be a huge deal about job loss and it would become a huge political football and suddenly you'd have testimonies about how great these jobs are.
This is one of the many reasons I do not eat meat.
Sadly... Just another example of corporate socialism in America.
I'm a full time cattle rancher. I hate the big 4 beef packing companies. JBS is the literal devil. (Look up COOL laws, Obama and JBS)  However I took a tour of Cargills beef packing facility in 2013 and it was immaculate. Top notch operation. Humane and clean.   My neighbor raises chickens for Pilgrims and he can barely make ends meet. Pilgrims can make up how much money you earn on the spot with no rhyme or reason. I don't see why anybody would want to be in the chicken business.
ok, the guinea pig with rabies was a pretty funny commercial not gonna lie...
And americans will be surprised about this? When you can buy 5kg of chicken wings for 2 bucks, how do you think it was made?
I'm sorry but how is this not automated in America?? In Europe, slaughterhouses have weight/size limits and the meat production line is automated, workers only check the quality and fix issues or pieces that have not been processed properly. Jesus christ, I thought America would have their sh*t together at least in some areas....
O look, sad apple face man is back.
The Tyson betting pool demonstrates that their employees are pawns - not ‘family.’
An other reason to not eat meat
OSHA is like that Beaurocracy headquarters in Futurama. Many rules are a joke and assume mental retardation of the employees. I got fined 5 grand for a wrench being on a concrete floor. ‘Spark hazard.’ The laws of beaurocracy trump the laws if physics at OSHA. Are you a parkour champion? Well fuck you, wear a safety harness when above 4 feet high.   There’s a lot of nonsense like that. People at desks with no real labor experience making rules that ignore reality and your skillset, becuase one jackass threw a wrench-shaped lighter into a gasoline tank or something. Sometimes equity is better than equality.
And, tell me how black people are your arch nemesis white America? Crazy madness
When will we start talking about the LARGEST RACIST GROUP on the planet putting us all at risk daily, THE WEALTHY!    They also purchase 20 bedroom mansions for 1 or 2 people to live in using the power equivalent to 5,000 smaller  homes combined!  Those Yacht's, those jets, etc.. There's so much more to add, but I'd be here all day!
john oliver is just upset that he’s not packing meat
Is bluuuuuuuuue
Amazon does the same thing...  We literally have slave labor in the US again...
It's almost like a system that rewards profits and gains seems to misplace the priorities of everyone.
I was thinking about cricket farming as a more humane and sustainable way of getting protein. Now after I saw this, definitely so.
I thought US meat production has been fully automated already. How do you ensure no contamination when you have pathogen dish like human hands right next to the meat. I'm working in a 3rd world country and meat here are processed by fully automated factory. No lost finger. You only need a dozen or two engineers to maintain it.
Welcome to The Jungle.
It's almost as if capitalism encourages companies to abuse their workers for profit and for the benefit of the bourgeoisie...
So I guess “The Jungle” is still applicable to today
Not much has really changed since The Jungle was published.
This is one of the reasons why I stopped buying protein from major retailers long ago. If you have the means, support your local farmers market and butcher shops.
Were you not forced to read The Jungle in high school?
Is it me or those jobs seem automatable
"Immigrants" No legal immigrant worries about reporting an illegal or unsafe operation. Which can only mean....
Upton Sinclair would be rolling in his grave if not for the merciful process of natural decay.
The most powerful vote Americans can make is with their dollars.  Most Americans will react with faux shock and disgust watching this... while eating mcnuggets.
Nothing has changed in over a hundred years.  The Jungle The Jungle is a 1906 novel by the American journalist and novelist Upton Sinclair. The novel portrays the harsh conditions and exploited lives of immigrants in the United States in Chicago and similar industrialized cities. Sinclair's primary purpose in describing the meat industry and its working conditions was to…
When an employer says “it’s like family here “, what they are really saying is “working here will probably leave you with some serious psychological trauma “
Why take life in our own hands when we could let go of everything and trust God? Living for pleasure and gain doesn’t matter since death and time erases all your hard work. It’s all meaningless. Of course, if we don’t believe in God, whether we live an honest life or not would also be meaningless (Be of no consequence). Now if you take into consideration that there’s over 2 billion people on earth making their claims that God is real, would you gamble with your life the same way you would with money? Truly, it’s only when you believe in God, does one’s life become meaningful. Simply because it now means there will be consequences for your actions. As I say this to you now, not to force anything on you, but to encourage you to at least do your own research. Don’t gamble with your life.  - William  John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
My girlfriend actually worked at a Pilgrim plant before moving to the Netherlands to be with me. The stories I heard disgust me. One time a coworker fell, hit her head and was knocked out. Everyone was told to keep working and step over her. She herself, suffering from severe depression, went to her boss saying she was about to kill herself and was told to "not do that and go back to work". Any opportunity they get they love to remind you how expendable you are.   How the fuck the people in managerial positions at those plants look at themselves in the mirror or sleep at night, I'll never know. Then again, since knowing her and also since I watch last week tonight, I've learned how much of a corporate hell-scape the US is for anyone who isn't rich to begin with.   Freedom above anything, especially companies and always despite how much it fucks over the working class, even though they're told by politicians (especially on the right) it's what they want.
The evils of chicken companies are not new to vegans.
that hamster is a Xenomorph and the dad is an android named David
14:41 These guys played too much Skyrim.
This smells of modern slavery, strangulation contracts, complete disrespect for human dignity. Employees are treated as disposable items, not as valuable assets.
Short of a sustained national labor strike there is no way to fix any of this. Corporations control government at the state and federal levels. Unless we all recognize that and act together to stop it things will only get worse
The brawny equinox additonally soak because friction statistically bounce between a obedient tugboat. erect, lumpy cabinet
*cough cough* GO VEGAN *cough*
According to Thomas Frank, it's very likely what few OSHA people that do exist are industry hacks "self-policing" the industry under a government name.  So OSHA and other regulatory agencies continue to technically exist -- providing false comfort -- while turning two blind eyes to the industries they are supposed to be regulating.
Lol looks like he has aged 20 years in the last 4, must be hard spouting out so much garbage. I miss when he was on comedy central and actually kinda funny 10 years ago
This is clearly a country that renounces socialism lol
Well I'm going vegetarian
1:42 The meat industry’s “employees are extremely important to our nation’s food supply.” That’s the main thing wrong with this video. The meat and dairy industry needs to be abolished through a permanent boycott of animal products. That industry is responsible for increased risks of pandemics like bird flu, swine flu and mad cow disease. Its foods increase our risk for cancer and heart disease. And, as John Oliver makes clear, that same industry treats its workers terribly.
I was brushing my teeth while watching this.   I gagged so badly and couldn't turn my phone off fast enough!!!  No more John Oliver in the morning!
Amazon Warehouse Workers: We never get breaks...this sucks.  Meatpackers: ...Hold my cleaver. No, seriously, hold my cleaver. I gotta take a piss.
Another banger video.
612 Vegans disliked this video !!
This was the wrong video to watch eating my lunch
leftits want workers to be treated not like shit, unhinged capitalism is just the natural way of doing things
Wow. The "that is disgusting" callback is how every one of Seth Meyers' deep dives ends. Wonder where John Oliver's team got it from...
Well next time somebody tells me hunting for meat is unethical I’ll just point them in this direction enjoy your pork and urine folks.
Yellow Journalism at its best
Didn't Upton Sinclair and other muckrakers criticize the working conditions in American (meat packing!!!) factories over 100 (!!!) years ago? All that progress, and still no progress.  How about this: No one should be allowed to make decisions in a company if they haven't worked each one of the lowest-paid jobs in their company for at least a month. Since empathy doesn't seem to work, people clearly need to learn from experience. Until human beings start treating other human beings humanely, humanity should rightfully consider itself the absolute dead end of evolution. How can anyone expect that any of those greedy, power-hungry, heartless capitalist monsters would ever care about animals, nature, climate change, and environmental protection if humans don't even freaking care about other humans?  There is just so much wrong with us that I'm almost tempted to think it's good that we're destroying ourselves. Let's just hope we won't take too much innocent life with us while we're at it.
You know damn well those senators didn’t take the money because they got caught first
I thought the chicken cleaning was automated. This is freaking bizarre. This is just white coloured slavery. Can't imagine what it must be like in other countries.
You do know that for most people it is possible to stop consuming meat, right? Animal products in general.
So glad to see a new video
Simply automate, outsource or use trained monkeys. Problem solved. No need to thank me.
Family? Yeah, a mafia family
John, can you add a mini segment: 1. Where to go for meat that isn’t processed this way 2. Maybe a way we can all stand against the packing plants? Or for workers rights? Like a petition, a hashtag... something. A plan. 💜 glad you’re back from the break
Anyone else slowly realizing that the state of US labor rights is absolutely horrifying while you’re supposed to be “contributing to the economy” acting like it doesn’t kill people
Sometimes I'm glad I've been a vegan for 18 years
11:21 we know that owl is you john
Upton Sinclair's, The Jungle, published in 1907, told the same story. Some things never change.
Vegans: stop paying for animals products. They exploit animals, the environment and people, and it's complete unnecessary. Meat eaters: f-ck you assholes.  Let's face it, meat eaters could give a shit about animals or humans, all they care about is their OWN palate pleasure.
They give no fucks about human life,rights or dignity  God bless America..........
Good to see the good ol' pre-Trump pre-2020 John Oliver back.
Snake pits.
Since I don't really have anything to add, I'll just say...  Holy shit. An entire piece that doesn't once mention Trump. It's almost pure...
Two weeks in a row explaining how eating meat might be against many of our own personal morals, without even talking about factory farming because we already know it is.
Don't get me wrong, these companies are doing terrible things and need to be stopped, but this isn't comparable to slavery or sweatshop workers in China.
John just say "end capitalism" outright already
Oh so you mean that eating meat causes global warming,the most violent conditions for the animal and now the pour people that cut them into pieces. At least there are two percent of us trying to stop that.TWO PERCENT!!!! NOT ALOT GETS done even when the majority wants it but when only two percent.
When he said “family,” he meant in the Charles Manson sense.
If their employees are "family" then the company is a serial killer who murders their own family
I remember “dealing” with this issue back in the early 90’s, when carpal tunnel syndrome was the thing. I guess this is what happens when people fall for, “Big gov’ment is bad.” Big government regulates how much Big Business can abuse its workers!
So I nearly fell to my death as a temp worker at an industrial container factory, completely unrelated to meatpacking, because these chickenfuckers made it nearly impossible for the government to actually protect workers?
I am really shocked to hear that. Not because how terrible this is, but because we do have the exact same situation over here in Germany. Market is controlled by a few huge companies and their factories are the most dangerous COVID Hotspots in their areas. 😢
We need to re-regulate the public and private sectors.   Just go ahead and undo all of that deregulation from the GW Bush Administration.
brain tired and slow, so my only thought during the perdue ad: guinea pigs are lactose intolerant, chubby cant have milk
Everybody gives me shit for being a vegetarian but ho boy the tables get turning
They have the option of working somewhere else.

Vote with your dollars. Don't pay this rich bastards to exploit, murder and destroy. #GoVegan
I don’t get the dislikes of this video... what kind of human being you should be to excuse the sociopaths in charge of meat processing plants
Why is the garlic bread so small though
This video uncovers an extremely ugly part of America’s nauseating meat industry. It would be more interesting to see what will be done about all of these atrocities!
Yet another reason not to eat meat...
Wow, it's almost like capitalism is an inherently flawed system that needs to be abandoned completely or at the very least, restructured from the ground up...
"meatpacking" and in some weird way i think he is going to talk about how its all Trumps fault and everything bad that has happened in the world is also Trumps fault.  Joe "greatest president in the world" Biden can absolutely do no wrong.  not going to watch this though, as i dont trust people with a derangement syndrome.
Has that guinea pig been hangin' out with the rabbit of Caerbannog or something?
This is America.
I find it fascinating how almost every problem starts with "it's controlled by these few companies" in a country that big with over 300 million people.
I still think it should be illegal for companies to be able to make you sign away your rights. These contracts are going directly against laws that are meant to protect workers.
With the sad world we live in we could actually give these workers another job, a better paying job and they would fight us just like the coal industry saying there’s nothing better
Workers feel disposable because corporations (any corporation) feels they are disposable. You are not paid according to your efforts on the job - you are paid according to how easy it is to replace you. I work for a fishing line company that convinced the government that their company was essential during the pandemic. They dicker about raises, start you out at minimum wage because they can, laid off all the higher wage earners at the beginning of the pandemic and don't teach you what you need to learn so as not to give you a full raise. Do they care if I were to quit tomorrow? No. Frankly, they'll higher a high schooler or retiree for their entry level job and pay them less.
the workers are "expendable... the "gov" has created a "gmo" (genetically mutated living organism) "meat" for us that will replace natural meat. we ARE what we eat... read ingredients... "subway" serves "gmo meats". cambells, v 8 splash, some candies are already using "gmo"s
Upton sinclair  We need you
But if u make min wage. Just quit and pick up another min wage job. Easy
The violent yoke sequently request because pumpkin microregionally occur across a acceptable step. equal, general gentle pot
Jhon, you should make a video talking about Rappi, Colombia’s (and soon all Latin America) most used food delivery app. They literally exploit their employees by paying them incredibly low fees, not providing them with health or accident insurances, making them even buy the implements they need to work with and much more.
People give me shit for not eating meat like it's only about the animals :/
Reasons to get fired: Making fun of the service your business daddy AT&T provides.  Come on stephen, why'd you forget about business daddy?
It says a lot about how these people treat their actual family
"we treat our employees like family" is the company equivalent of "we treat our workers like slaves"
Both hands crushed and had to sign with a pen in his mouth.... How are these people not in prison....? Right, I forgot. Prison isn't actually for criminals. It's for people they want to enslave. Justice system my ass.
Thats Dane Judy Dench, you show some respect!
there would have been a good bert kreischer joke in there: "no one should be treated like a machine unless you're this guy" - cut to bert toples "I AM THE MACHINE" -end scene
Go vegan to not fund this anymore
Whoever is writting the jokes during the pandemic, are you alright? The jokes are almost all depicting John as a man full of weird Kinks and the timing is way off :/ I watch every episode and the quality of the jokes has gone way down :/ It seems they are being written by only one person with no brainstorm whatsoever. John saves the format with his personality at least.
God bless John and his fantastic team (take a bow guys) for making videos like this....
kill off all labour rights and this exploitation is what you end up with. but worker's unions are evil right?
Maybe for u Brits it's Judy Dench but here in America its either Betty white or dolly Parton ITHANKU
Who watches this shit?
Good thing the US doesn't have socialist, universal healthcare. That would relieve the cost and stress of dealing with accidents for the employers, employees, lawyers.... In Norway we have Universal healthcare. Also, waivers are illegal. Waivers such as these are called Voldgift, which roughly translates to Violent Commitment. Sad day for Norwegians.
We need another Upton Sinclair to write this generation's "The Jungle".
Had a good laugh. Thanks, John.
USA is a dystopia
Covid-19 only kills the old and weak...brown humans are not healthy as they die by covid-19 at rates way above. Lighter colored humans..... .. facts on death rates show this clearly...... When birthing multiple babies... neglect is common due to time and resources allotted per child...
(looks at number of dislikes) Wow, who knew 548 meatpacking execs watch this channel?  That's not fair... some of them could be corrupt officials...
Worked at Tyson for several years as a maintenance technician. My schedule was 7 days a week 12 hours a day. I usually got 9-11 days off a year including  holidays.
Dear United States!  We have officially revoked your status as a "Developed country".  You can reapply once you have got your shit together. // Sincerely, the real developed countries
Same problem here in Germany, just google Tönnies, a meat packaging company in Northrhein-Westphalia. Same shit.
Dont think it's TRUE. I worked at pilgrim's pride in chattanooga.  Yea its fucking TRUE!
Mr Oliver, there were a few things that happened during LWT's break. Like a near COUP. You guys should cover that!
This isn't a race thing John. You just helped ruin the conversation.
Americans: USA is the best country. Europeans after seeing meatpacking, warehouses, opoiods and healthcare system: Sure buddy, live in delusion...
We had a pool open at Home Depot on who was going to quit and how long it would take.
"Hey!... Eh, I get it" oof size: Big
Screw OSHA the only way to fix those companies is to ✨Burn them the fuck down✨
Wasn’t this brought to our attention back in 1906 by Upton Sinclair?
Other keywords that you'll likely be treated poorly is "looking for team players. "
Upton Sinclair is rolling in his grave.
Why can't factories just hire more workers? The CEOs will still be millionaires regardless.
The possible deficit conventionally nest because physician mathematically afford except a determined sheep. historical, protective china
My job isn’t quite that blatantly awful but there are enough similarities that made it pretty easy to predict how it his segment was gonna go,  The only difference being that there are customers that walk in our building, but the manipulative manager rhetoric is exactly the same. This is why rich people really really really don’t want folks to think about socialism; their heads are on the line when we do, America, this is an emergency
My niece works at a chicken processing plant. She got covid and was forced to finish the days work with 103.2 temp. She was then let go for the two weeks and then rehired two weeks layer to avoid some # they have to report of employees who have tested positive.
I worked in a pork processing plant for close to 15 years, and I can tell you there is a lot of truth in this video.
Working at a mirror factory next to the county jail, after I was released for smoking marijuana was the gateway into methamphetamine use.  I'm so glad the fines I paid went to government to fix it all.
What can we do about this horrible awful industry 😭
14:32
If you were looking for a sign, here it is: go vegan
So glad I'm plant based.    Changed my entire way of living, thinking, healing.
Maybe we could also consider just not eating meat? Stop killing animals unnecessarily, be perfectly healthy, prevent future pandemics, help the environment...seems like a rational conclusion to me  🤷 crazy idea I know
"I know this sounds very bad" I mean its hard to get worse then using your teeth to sign a form about not being responsible for the broken arms like American Companys will never change until we get new Senators and House members and vote by there actions not there promises.
Greatest country in the world ! Right fucking there. USA USA USA ... 😂
Did I miss an episode of this new season?  Last episode and now meatpacking?  I was really hoping to hear your commentary regarding Trump, the capital riot, second impeachment, Biden etc as a main topic.
Chaplin, missed an opportunity.
Love this kind of episodes, last two years where all American politics
Wilfully ignorant... "not in our country" lol nigga, all up in our country at all times.
One action that doesn't resolve this issue but would surely help and would also bring about a better world.... EAT LESS MEAT!   Meat consumption in the USA is simply appalling! And yes, chicken nuggets count! You are killing yourselves and killing the whole planet, you gluttons!!!
You can’t save everything you come across, maybe in a small technology advanced country but not the US and certainly not China. Life is cheap when you have hundreds of millions. Your not helping them by increasing living standards for workers, it will just raise costs and they will be replaced by Automation, or some third world nation will end up doing it, the truth hurts
More blood on the alter of laissez faire capitalism
as a European, im shocked every week how you doing oversee...
You made me gag in front of my child, you heartless son of a mother
Honestly, if your company doesn't like referring to you as an employee or coworker and instead uses family, partner, or other terms, there's a good chance you don't want to be a part of that family.
why is zazzu trying to be upton sinclair
Consumers are why this is happening. Are you a consumer, still?
John Oliver knows all about meatpacking
every time I watch this show i get happer for not living in the U.S .. its like a shitshow there ..
"A Fraction of a Fuck"   :-)
So can we say that this incident is Tyson's Waterloo?   I'll see my self out
If anyone in late night knows about meatpacking it would definitely be John Oliver. Glad you're back!
This guy only knows about fudge packing
I'm so tired of people being treated like this!
your stats for the Waterloo, Iowa plant are probably a lot lower than the real numbers. Our Governor was caught omitting meat packing plant stats. There were also reports over the summer that the workers with symptoms were told they had to come to work or lose their jobs.
Just another reason to go vegan
This is why Unions exist. And also: America is so effing weird when it comes to how Unions are regulated.
Well, this solidified my decision to have oatmeal this morning.
We need another "the jungle"
The corporate solution is probably to have urinals and toilets right near the conveyor belts.
my aunt works at Tyson's in Arkansas too the capitol for that fucking business. "Family" means never raising your wages and treating you like a fucking slave.
Every episode from „Last week tonight“ makes me happy af that i live in europe.
America is a third world country in so many ways...
Thank you for this, I work at a small Kansas  meat packing plant. 10hr days 3 people wear masks, we have all been sick. No one gets tested or stays home sick out of fear of punishment. We even had our own pee incident.
As someone who has lived in Mt. Pleasant, TX (where those Bo Pilgrim statues are located) I'm SO happy those were shown. The smell in the morning when I lived there was not great due to the pilgrims pride plant that was there.
It's been pretty known that it is hard to start up and run a small scale food processing plant. Out here in rural Illinois the local meat lockers have almost a year wait list, so it would be an incredibly profitable business to start up, but the startup costs are pretty much insurmountable.
The Jungle by Upton Sinclair (1906 colorized)
What's with the never ending beastiality jokes?
Expose them all Oliver, don't stop with this one . Listening to this ..Now I'm not hungry.
Disgraceful is a better word
'We're a family' or 'family first' are dead giveaways that you are working for a company that doesn't care about you or your family, which is basically a typical blue collar job in America. For some perspective, the US Army, which I served in for about 12 years, was more like a family/family friendly than any civilian job I've had, save for the pizza joint I worked at through high school.
I work in a deli and our main business driver is our fried chicken. I used to get mad when we would get boxes in that weren't cut properly into individual pieces. I now will not ever get mad again 2 seconds wtf
I’ve been a vegetarian for 9 years, vegan for 1. And a big reason is the lives of the people that have to have these gut wrenching, soul crushing jobs. Oof... there’s literally not reason to keep eating meat.
Thank you
I am desperate for lab meet, when can I finally get some? I went vegetarian for too long already because of this shit.
When John Oliver says stuff like this I wish he offered a solution to us as consumers on what we can do to get this going. Do we need to call legislators? Lobbyist? Should we boycott Tyson? How can we push for OSHA to get a damn backbone?? Something! With all of the viewers he has he could really make great change if he gave us some kind of direction!
We bet at our office and we all work remotely. So what's the point?
If you fix the problem, meat triples in price. It's just like gas. The tree huggers bitch and moan about pipelines and fracking, then bitch when the price goes up because they got the pipeline and fracking stopped.  You can't have it both ways.  I'm not saying it's right, I'm just sayin'
Ask your  mom, she knows how to pack meat
Just stop supporting this cruel and disgusting industry. We do not need it in 2021. It is destroying our planet and health, taking advantage of poor people, and causing immense suffering and death to the animals. Stop eating meat; go vegan.
vegan world now
Sorry guys, wanting to help workers and limit capitalism’s ability to self regulate is just socialism. Don’t let the libtards take our freedom. Praise Jesus.
Two of the 4 beef packers are Brazilian controlled. The industry not only exploits slave labor with union busting and illegal immigrants, but also collude on pricing and prohibit Country of Origin labels on the beef they sell. They use political bribes to create regulations that eliminate competition from challenging the oligarchy.
Wow, actually a topic i cant laugh about as a german since we actually flew in our seasonal workers from southeastern europe and kept them under similar conditions, though with a bit more chance about doing something against it.
thrue first wave off covid i worked in factory and we work like nothing ever hapend and our condition was simular we were mask but we somoked in small room 2m*2m with like 5 people insied
While I knew that the work condition for employees were crap in meat packer plants, I would love to know what the vegetable, fruit, and seed processing companies look like.  Is this an issue with the plants operation or related to animal products?  I suspect that the issue is more related to the treatment of employees has machines which is not limited to these type of processing plants.
Just like the movie "Parasite"
Some parents see their children as their most valuable asset. Using their kids for labor in their failing business'. Such a shame.
He's making that money........
Yay another reason to stop eating meat.
Big business is to society what cancer is to a living organism. It grows without regard for the environment or other entities around it, hogs resources, bypasses regulating measures, and inevitably results in the death of its host. Humanity needs to excise this tumor before it kills us.
I'm European. You're fucking crazy, America
Its not just a problem with the industry, a lack of empathy is practically a mandate of our economy.
I'm glad I'm going vegan.
It's like the movie _"I care a lot."_
I don't believe this is a accurate depiction of all plants
A guy died at target last year
This show should be renamed The Social Justice Show.
This country makes me sick
What if people voted for worker protection, but the electorate is too busy worried about what another person does in their personal life, or worshiping rich people who could not care less about their lives.
My wife worked in HR at a Tyson that had a union.  Guess what Tyson did because the Union was getting decent wages?  They just closed the plant and moved the upper management to a new plant, built in a place without a union.  Classy.
Given the story of the pilgrims and the native americans the name Pilgrim's Pride seems quite adequate to me.
So does Target 🎯
Sounds like that company is run by Dominic Toretto
Years and years things like this have been going on in USA and Canada - in any kind of farm labor. Separate laws, wages etc as "normal" Americans and Canadians don't want the seasonal minimum wage or less work. I grew up doing farm work, and I got paid the same as everyone my grandmother hired. But I also have worked at places that hired only migrant workers - insane the rules, the pay and the ways they came up with to not have to pay for the full amount.
11:17 Efukt
”BUT WORKERS RIGHTS FOR NON WHITES IS SOCIALISMMMMMMM!!!!!!”  //Rightwingers
LOL, this guy still at it?  Finding odd things to make emergencies out of and hyping them up without actually fixing anything.
The US is a dystopia.
American dream, am I right? What a shit-hole...
Who wants John to talk about the Sixth Extinction?
Pretty much the same as in Germany. We usually get people from Romania, put them in a company that has extra been set up to employ these people to just split off the legal responsibility from the main company and if shit hits the fan and they get sued, they just let their extra company die and open a new one without any ramifications for the mother company...
Almost forgot to leave a comment for the algorithm. This is such an important topic!
The minute an employer starts saying that their company is a family & it's employees are members of their family. That is when you know that they are not getting paid enought to live & free treatment they get is abusive!
Upton Sinclair: First Time?
Finally something not about Trump
So glad I'm vegan and am not responsible for any of this
From the comments it sounds like John has nearly as many viewers outside the US as in the US, lol. Greetings to all the other Europeans!
Essential workers in the US are just expendable workers, who are treated as slaves. The US is a failed state, a feudal state. If more Americans knew just how badly they are treated, in comparison to most in other developed nations, there's be mass protests and general strikes within days. The US is basically screwed.
And people say that China abuses their citizens.
Those rich people are right out evil! Something's seriously wrong here. And why aren't there laws in place to protect those workers? And...why are those Pepublicans elected in the first place? This is totally crazy!  Maybe a sweatshop in China isn't so bad after all! 🤷🏻‍♂️
After Artemis fowl Judi Dench is no longer a treasure.
3:00 yeah, no, betting on who dies next is a family tradition, so I see that claim holding up a-ok. That being said, got to go, I have not tried poisoning Uncle Robert in quite a while. Let's see if he is still cautious enough.
Why is no one talking about that fucking guinea pig commercial? How did they think of that? Why did they think it was a good idea? I have so many questions.
Oh, look, it's JBS winning the world by murder! By the way, you'd be surprised what you'd find if you search for JBS' history (including in this YT channel). Yes, it's the same firm connected to corruption in Brazil.
Jeff bazo's change the game and all the rich are trying to get back the money from 2008. Shit is real fuck up everywhere
I'm less than 1 minute in and I just have to ask: what the fuck is wrong with America and their ads? It's like you guys are the Japan of the western world
Last week Tonight with John Oliver: bluntly proving the argument that there is no ethical consumption under capitalism and that America is a more dystopian shithole country than you know and that either political parties will tell you Since 2014.
Campaign finance reform?   Duh
It's Dame Judi Dench to you, mister!
Yeah, that commercial didn't make sense, lol.
I'm so tired of the useless Corona and Trump stuff
Finally actual news
Yup "greatest country in the world" indeed. For the top 1%, that is
A company that profits off the torture and murder of nonhuman animals is NEVER going to treat its employees well!
the title about meatpacking me, a Brazillian: ohhh, they'll talk about JBS! (JBS its a brazillian company, and its far worst than you imagine. here in Brazil, they face actions against SLAVARY)
And that my friends is called Capitalism which appearently „just works“
I thought he was going to mention Adam Driver when he opened about animals higher on his food chain
I'm glad someone is watching 8 west atleast
I'm a truck driver who works for a company and JBS and Tyson is one of our biggest clients. It's a little horrifying to hear about what is going on inside the building all these places I visit all the time.
The US really is a hypercapitalist dystopia. Here in germany we still have pressing issues, but most of the things in this video would be illegal in germany and cost the company millions of dollars in fines and compensation. How much power do companies in the US have, if they can make an inspector of the government agency for health and safety wear a box on their head to not see safety issues? In germany such inspectors basically have to power to immediately shut down the plant, if they find any health or safety issues.
This is what happens when you bust the unions
It seems that this is a problem perpetuated by illegal immigration. But try to control the border and you’re labeled as racist. As far as there’s open borders problems like this will be impossible to solve.
Glad i dont live in the US.
*Hey, should we be worried that someone with so much Control of your food, your **_FOOD_** supply produces an advertisement straight out of love and trust turned into a Horror Movie?*
You need thousands of those jobs to make one billionaire. The American dream.
People: waw this is so terrible Same exact people: (bites into cheeseburger) Geez vegans are so annoying
That local Michigan talk show is actually my local ABC affiliate.
Recommendation for the show, if you can: Tell the audience what steps we can take to help as individuals. That would help organize your audience more effectively for action. Even if we can think of actions on our own, they may not be the most effective ones or get enough of the rest of people taking similar actions to nudge the dial.
Awe yes a topic I never cared about but watched all the way through
I personally enjoy these commmentaries on capitalism gone wrong!
🐥🐤🐣🐓🐔🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓☹☹☹☹
American is a 3rd world country.
Cuomo killed thousands of elderly. This whole segment is a distraction from the truth. Wake up America foreigners like this pos r destroying America, while simultaneously propping up China who literally run slave camps.
Bunch of old stuff... one of the exaples cited is from 1989... 32 years ago... meat industry sure is fucked up but if u are going to expose yhem try no to use archives older then 90% of ur viwers
Sooo miss piggy like scatology
The US is about 200 years behind the developed world when it comes to labor laws. Probably around 2000 when it comes to public health service. Catch up.  Such a pathetic country.
America is a shitty country for middle and poor class.
All the rules we follow today all the business practices all the structure exists today is a result of the slow degradation of the value of human life and the empathy for your fellow man. Today the average CEO aspires to be a CEO not to create jobs not to build infrastructure not to build anything permanent but to get a supercar and play video games all day and get your PP sucked by two girls at the same time in a swimming pool in the desert.
amazing that this whole video is about severe harm to humans, and all the vegans in the comments are just talking about how the REAL victims are the chickens
I live in Waterloo.
Oh shit new theme
Well it has gotten a little better since "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair, but we still have a ways to go..
The Jungle Part 2
This is actually factually and truthfully what's wrong with this country. Employer versus employee.  Not all bosses in America are bad but something in the order of 80% really could care less whether you live or die.  Most rich people in this country that make money off the backs of American labor don't understand what it took to get them there so they don't ever put anything back into the system that made it possible in the first place humanity doesn't improve individuals do. And I'm speaking about everyone from the galactically rich billionaires down to the still more than I'll ever make millionaires. I just don't understand how we're such a scientifically adept people with so much money and power and so little concern for making it more awesome to be a human being.
Proposal: When a business violates a work safety law, they're liable for every employee in the organization exposed to that risk, not just the one that falls victim to it.  So if a plant isn't up to code and a worker loses a hand, the fine isn't for the one injured worker, it's for all the employees in said plant that were also risking said injury. If an inspection discovers that safety procedures aren't being followed, the fine is multiplied by the number of employees the procedures were meant to protect. This would effectively skyrocket penalties for large consolidated workplaces with negligent management, and allow the penalties to scale correctly with the size of the business.  In addition, if fines collected are high enough in scale, this money could be used to expand OSHA and other programs. Structure the organization in a similar way to how many local police departments use collected fines to supplement their budgets. Larger fines bring in more OSHA funds which lead to more inspections and more fines, which in theory would result in an eventual equilibrium wherein OSHA attains a size proportional to the violations it can collect on.  It's still not a perfect solution, and fines are still only fines, but would certainly be worth testing, certainly a step in the right direction. Corporatize the workplace safety organization and suddenly you're fighting for-profit giants with your own for-profit giant. Settle the fight between regulation and the free market by turning the regulating body into its own competing market.
Boo hoo 😥
We are in such need a of Workers Movement, the Corporate system doesn't care about its workers.
knowing that meat production is hell for humans and animals, what are your excuse to still eat meat?
I love that the one host notes, “I get people need jobs...” without pointing out that the plant owners should be held to account for the horrid conditions, not the workers for having to do that in order to survive.
YouTube better never play this shit on auto play again or I’ll uninstall this app
This is why you should NEVER give a company you work for 110%. They don't care if you've never called in for a sick day or have never been late. You're a replaceable as they come. That's why I like to think that if you're making minimum wage then work the minimum.
These are very dysfunctional families
this is what happens when a country destroys all the unions and let capitalism run amok.
Upton Sinclair’s book “The Jungle” came out in 1906...over 100 years later, and conditions for workers in the meat industry are still terrible.
PLZ MAKE THE NEXT EPISODE ABOUT ALEXY NAVALNY!!!✌❤🗽🙂
You should look into the big warehouse company’s too!
OSHA isn’t tough unless it’s on little guys. Corporations run America
Just the same in Germany with " Tönnies" mest company... Even a big football Club made him resign his seat in the management if the club! Jup, just to keep that pork/chicken cheap
Hey John great story! Trugreen lawn company also has employees that I’ve witnessed peeing in buckets or bottles or just in the back of their truck to keep up with insane work pace
America is a shit hole because of Republicans... Just saying...
Yea another meat related video and not ONE MENTION of the word “vegan” or “plant-based” as possible solution for this clusterf***. 8.5M subscribers casts a pretty big shadow, John. Use it.
Another of the reasons I'm vegetarian.
The United States is owned by companies. It isn't a republic anymore but a oligarchy with a few aspects of democracy. All because politicans care more about money and power than they do about Americans. So the only way to fix these problems is to get company money out of the government completely. Unless it's Taxes which need to be raised for these companies.
The pilgrim guy sounds like the inspo for that x-files episode where they are spreading tay-Sachs at the chicken plant and the plant owner is like a 200yo witch doctor who does human sacrifice-
Notice how the trashiest companies always go to republican states?
Sweet capitalism...
I thought OSHA could come in whenever they wanted to, I'm not sure how the meat packing plants are getting around that.
3:00 Holy shit indeed.
Killing animals at factory farms has got to be the lowest, dirtiest jobs of all time ... disgusting & immoral 👎👎👎👎👎 😵😵😵😵😵😵☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
I worked at a chicken factory for exactly one month. The second day there I could barely move my wrists from the same repetitive motion for 8 hours. The line was too fast and supervisors got lippy with me for struggling to keep up. The conditions were horrible and I went home with a sore throat every night because of how cold and wet it was. My breaking point was when I started to get nauseous and have bathroom troubles and asked to go home. The supervisor said to see the nurse for him to determine if I could leave. I was gagging on the line barely able to see straight and had to sneak to the bathroom to vomit. The nurse gave me some chewable Pepto tablets and said that I was fine to go back to the line. I walked out without telling anybody and never went back. I realize that I was fortunate to be able to do that. Imagine the people who aren't possibly contaminating chicken because they aren't allowed to go home when they're sick. Imagine how much sicker they could get being forced to stay there. It's horrible. :(
Feels like slavery for workers
Meat packing only? Many profit focus companies put their workers in the extreme conditions such that they either can't eat, sleep, rest, relief, and going home.
John Oliver STOLE ''The Patriot Act'' style
GO VEGAN and nobody gets hurt!
I sent contacted osha about my job. They said they would do an investigation and get back to me in 10 days and I never heard from them again
Who else just lost their appetite?
Why is this in my recommended? Who is this person🤷🏻‍♀️
Yeah back in the begining of the industrial revolution there were no worker rights. Some of the business owners knew it wasn't good situation when competition could drive working conditions to hell. Others especially the meglaminiacd slavers... Bullies they were self entitled deluded with god like powers of life and death of others. Not bullish like Trump but actually bullies who get off on your plight.   Our country our gov. can at times be responsive to the people. Other times it takes a bunch of young women to be burned alive locked inside there work place, and polluted air and rivers. Yeah they allowed unions after that. You know thou that there were people who understood the problem but the country was self absorbed in something that wasn't right.   You know how they are, They cannot afford to have others participating in the economy. Like the Dems defending slavery and the desecration of the of the constitution, because how could they ever survive without ownership of your fellow human and free labor.   If you want capitalism and freedom. Which I think most sane people do. However businesses fret at competition. The idea that it's ok to do something better and not be destroyed by some eh Then things need to adhere to the constitution. The gov is not dumb or stupid or anything. It's like it's not a person. So I am for unions where there needs to be unions. These large factories with these full of shit mangers and sups. The people doing the work on the floor need that power to keep management from turning everything hung into hell. I've been damaged working at factory and I blame it on the management. I just think they terrible managers of the work force. They got that look on their face like they've gotta go to the bathroom and stick their head in a toilet before they crap all over everyone. Sounds stupid but that's the way some them are. On that same note I'm 100% against gov. Workers teachers agencies depts military absolutely none them should allowed unionize and dictate to the voters what they should be paid. Can we not have some people in office that actually represent their constituents. One company two page political ad in newspaper. Smh anyhow there's a balance that needs to be kept with unions as in they need to deal with the markets not with taxpayers but with their company. To much gov we gonna belly up when the bill comes due and I'm not the one that's going be blamed.   If they want us to go at it like professional sports. They're going to have to cut the number hours on high intensity and repetitive motions. Then they should provide the medical support that professional athletes get. I'm thinking 6hrs max and still need rotations. Scientific fact muscles tendons joints if overworked degenerate.   So then what's these managersand sups going to do about these damaged people. Tell them they should've been more of an asshole like them. As they complain about the burden these messed up people caused them. I do take some personal responsibility but yeah it's not good. I just don't really know what good the management is or is just some programed positions that well idk I guess when add that cheap migrant labor to the mix it just goes stupid
What about when Tyson locked the employees inside of a warehouse with no heat with feet of snow on the outside for almost a week with no food people died and nothing's happened to Tyson chicken.
I do say, I am shocked and chagrined to hear that there is CAPITALISM going on in this here establishment.
Workers are their family.... Rule of Acquisition 111: Treat people in your debt like family… exploit them.
As a retail worker through this pandemic I thought I had it rough this last year. Perspective is a good thing to have. I thought walmart couldn't be doing anything worse but I guess they could.
I recommend anyone to read The Jungle by Upton Sinclair. Entirely relevant even today
Its impressive how none of your jokes land without background laughts
I spent most of my career working in corporate America.    I can safely state, after decades of observation, that the majority of the suits are assholes.    Vain and greedy, they are driven by ego and money.   The employees are nothing more than resources to them, numbers.   They even named the department tasked with obtaining these resources as such.   Human resources.
You should see what pella doors has been doing. Lmao
THIS IS TOTALLY OUR COUNTRY.
14:40  :  gosh, I can't believe that the Skyrim bucket exploit can actually be done for real !
This is our Country
Why is anyone still referring to America as a First World country?
Are you guys gonna do an adrew cuomo piece... Or are you just gonna ignore a big news like that?
This last week tonight's Hols $hit moment is like 6 months old, I am not saying it was not important information 6 months ago but I have heard this from everywhere like 6 months ago.
this is the product of Republicans destroying unionized labor
i had a bicycle accident on my way home from work in late november, was in the hospital, haven't been to work since then, except for some crucial things, and haven't paid a cent for the treatment and have been paid my full salary every month because my accident (being on my way home from work) is classified as work related. it's just scary too see how things are in a supposed first world nation and the "leader of the free world"
Just asking for a friend but uhhh who won that bet? Lol
Meatpacking: The Lincoln Project.
America is burning itself to the ground in the name of helping the rich
I choose to buy meat alternatives at this point because of the disgrace of the meat industry. I don't consider myself vegetarian, but my money is not going to support this.
The statue of him reading a bible to a chicken is genuinely the funniest thing I’ve ever seen
This episode makes me so angry I forgot to laugh.
That industry is unbeleavably disgusting
Go vegan!
When you hear the words "We are a family" in your workplace it's time to start job-hunting....
Corona didn't rage uncontrollably in spring, but it raged uncontrolled. Even I, as a non-native speaker, understand the difference between something that can't be controlled and something that an orange, who happened to be president of the US at that time, just choose to not control...
Wow. No words.
Visit local harvest or Weston a price foundation  to find a farm near you to order from local farms and avoid corporate farming
Oh great, Waterloo getting a shoutout for all the wrong reasons!
Companies calling their employees family is bullshit
Just spent an hour researching vegetarian recipes as a result of this video.
You don't want to do a story on what Butterball male employees do to the turkeys.  There's a percentage.
I like the idea that our family members are assets; how much do you think I could get for my teenage cousin?
I honestly had no idea about how bad this is. Pretty sad...
"hErE, wE'rE faMilY"   That's corporate talk for we need to appear friendly to continue to milk our employees / profits.
And now I'm really just wondering how we fix this without having this escalate into Pinkerton-esque worker riots.
Aaaaaah my weekly dose of depression and wish for this world to burn in a quantum phase transition.
1:14 no Jon, they don't get talked about nearly enough. and what nearly no one wants to talk about are the emissions from the food industry. the world has set climate goals for 2050 for reaching somewhat near zero emissions and that means we need to save emissions in all sectors. everyone is talking about renewable energies and electric cars. almost no one is talking about the future of our food. depending on the source you look at, around a quarter of global emissions come from food. from those food emissions, around 50 % go back to animal agriculture (the farms, the crops for the animals and land use). around 30% of emissions go into producing crops and produce for human consumption. and yet only 17% of our globally consumed calories come from meat and dairy. meat and dairy are highly inefficient food sources, because they always use a middle-man (the animal), that needs to be bred and kept alive until slaughter/milking.  tl;dr: we have a highly inefficient food system which on it's own will prevent us from reaching the 2050 climate goals. we need to improve the way we produce food, because nowadays it is causing way too many emissions. that is the case for plants, dairy and meat. but dairy and meat are so inefficient, it doesn't matter how much we improve them. as long as those products come from living beings, they will be multiple times less efficient than plants.  sources: https://ourworldindata.org/food-ghg-emissions https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food  edit: and seeing how many people in the comment section are uninformed about the subject, just shows how important it is that this topic gets covered on a big show like yours. people often don't know that the majority of soy beans in the world get produced to feed animals, not to make tofu. many people believe that grass-fed beef is a viable "greener" option, but it is actually causing way more methane-emissions than factory farming and also needs multiple planet earths to have enough space for all the animals. and people also often still think that a diet without meat and dairy is unhealthy, while we have top athletes like Tom Brady, Lewis Hamilton, Novak Djokovic, Gabriel Medina and many more on plant-based diets. it is horrifying how much misinformation is out there while the emissions from our food industry are one of the biggest challenges of our time.
Dock worker after losing my job at the start of lockdown. I can tell you that I was personally told that if i tested positive i should still work if i was physically able and even though i was so physically exhausted i couldn't finish 5 hours of my 11 hour shift, thats right we were forced to work up to 60 hour per week with NO OVERTIME, I was pressured very heavily and even threated to come back to work just ONE DAY after testing positive.
Every day its like  surprise bitch america is worse than u thought it was 😒
If you have ever bought chicken wings for $.99, or chicken nuggets for $1.99, then you voted for this with your dollars. And after seeing this, ignorance is no longer an excuse.
So, I'm going vegetarian. 😭
All these fat people talking about how hard it is to sit at their desks all day.
Betting on people getting sick whats so different from wall street betting on businesses failing?
Every episode Jon shows another aspect of the US that is a hell hole because of the lack of regulations and government oversight. And I have to wonder - why has the US gotten this way, when all other developed nations haven't.   What is it historically that has made the US so opposed to government oversight that things have gotten this bad? Is it the cold war? An attempt to be so unlike communism that you've become the worst form of capitalism. Or does it go back further than that?  The concept of elected judges and money in politics is another thing. Why was that started in the first place when it is so clearly a breeding ground for corruption?  Can any historically savvy americans offer a theory on this?
Unfortunately, no one in power gives a damn. Per the usual in this country, nothing will change because it doesn't impact the wealthy.
John likes a good meat packing story.
USA is such a shitshow, it's marvelous to watch. I just imagine myself, saying to a safety official to "cover her head with this box"... 20 minutes later. Click click ! "Enjoy your prison time  !"
Maybe its a naive way to think, but im surprised to find that the facts are repeatedly there. Big companies loose control over their divisions. You cant promise anything as a CEO because you have little to no control. Yes there can be reform in some places, but to tackle the main problem at its roots? Very hard. Not only is it hard, its not in the interest of the owner too! You can say im generalizing, and its true, but its frustrating to learn about DuPont, about these meat industries, about child slave factories, in what hypocrite world are we living? There has been enough generations sparked with the fury pf change over the past years, what has their legacy become? I trully believe that the era of “hippies” in general, encompasses how humans claim to be the saviors, but prefer to watch the world burn from a distance.   Returning to the business part of this morning expulsion of my deep feelings of anger, i am all for smaller businesses world wide. That would mean more people with power, competition defined on quality of product. Costumers will become more specific on their choices, there wont be only 1 huge company who offers all the #1 choices.    And i believe in plant based feeding.
Reality check with john oliver
How is this even funny nah like this guys "comedy"
Hey, I'm from Brazil and I have a tip about JBS:  Type on Google "JBS" and "comer duas veias" and turn your translator on. Have fun.
God bless you John Oliver for keeping important stories to the front of the line. No one else does it better.
We love you John
Stop waiting for the politicians to do something. They’ve all been bought by big industries. Just stop buying factory farm meat. Either go vegan or shop at your local farmers market.
Corona killed the fake laughs in this show but didn't kill the faker.
I see we are back to our usual "disturbing and obscure facts about things you've never thought about before, with John Oliver"
WOW! They won't let people go to the bathroom?! And I thought having to wait for 2 hours was bad! ...Ok it IS, but not as bad as that! And also, "Put a box on your head!" Is not a good thing to say to an inspector! Almost as bad as saying 'The Covid cases at our plant [where people are mere inches away from each other] are not work related!"
giggidy
Power to the workers.
Not relevant to the current program but please make a video about Navalny #freenavalny
The reason the EU doesn't allow US meat on the European market is because it is shit.
Whotf is judi dench?
There’s a reason I’m a vegetarian 👌🏼
Hey I work on the ATM in that factory 🤣🤣 I used to live in Waterloo IA but moved to a town close by called Cedar Falls
John is the perverted owl. It's actually a painting about him. He just lied to us all. Shame on you John. You don't know if those peacocks are being forced into it.
All this under excuses of keeping food affordable right.   But how come the rich just keep getting richer, and for those that apparently need "affordable" meat it becomes ever increasingly non-affordable? Today's economy and the USA probably one of the worst in it, is about increasing the overall wealth of our civilization and pump it straight into the hands of only a handful of families and the scraps go to their underlings while the majority of people has to putt ever more effort into literally surviving.  The Ceo and hes family every day get richer, their employees every day sicker with nothing to show for, and that is if you aren't the one to actually loss a body part.
Thank you John.  Please do a short letting us know what more we can do. 😥
This the one thing that New York has better than most that I learned the past 12 years being a truck driver and that is!? The laws to protect workers in NYC and NY.. I've had trucking companies try to come for me legally to remain in their vehicles or contracts but thanks to the laws in New York, they fell back with the quickness.. Tennessee, Utah, Texas... All them Red States! Lobbyists and Republicans hand and hand.. Sad how the people of those States are really treated like expendable waste..
"68.3 percent' of hourly workers being "Black or African Amarican, Hispanic or Latino, Asian" breaks into roughly 23% per the 3 race/ethnicities shown. The remaining 37% I assume are white. I understand this might be due to Whites being the majority of the population in most areas, but the data still is presented in a disingenuous manner and seemingly ignores many whites are on the same boat as the minorities being used for the argument. The real issue being the lack of minorities in a salary position, but even then it should be considered the ethnic percentage of the population being drawn from.
And still half of the nation consistently votes for people that enable this type of thing. As a famous orange once said, what a shithole country.
This news is sadly becoming boring. So tired of hearing how flawed the US is.
I'm asking you as someone who has spent the last 10 years watching you, I fell in love with a loving a single mother, and her son is named Billy. I don't care what you make fun of, but please, can you change the name of your go to little boy name to something else? We broke up, and I love your show, but just hearing the word Billy brings me to tears. You can say Bobby, or anything else. I fucked Up, and I still love them both, so every time you say Billy, in a joke, it makes me want to quit watching. I love your programming too, not as much as them, so I'm asking a huge favor, please stop calling little boys as Billy. No threat, just a request so my heart will stop breaking every time I watch a video from you.
Hear! Hear! . WALLMART bought life insurance on their employees and made money when they died. Millions. Thats pretty low, i don't think you can go lower unless Wallmart makes bets on who's baby will die first. This all must stop.
I don't feel bad for people who make their living killing animals and defiling their corpses. It's called Karma.
I called in sick one day to get tested for Covid and was let go the next day.
That Perdue commercial reminds me of those killer bunnies on Monty Python.
"You're covered in blood, faeces and urine. You can get hurt in there" Is this a meat processing plant worker or a prison officer saying this?
It's been over a year now! It's fucking physical distancing not social! For fuck's sake
Is there a difference between those managers betting on the number of Covid cases and trump doing the same early on?  He actually fought the states for federal stockpiles of PPE and told people not to mask.  He whipped up those meatpacking plants to "get back to work".  Did you see any parallels between trump and Bo Pilgrim?  And holding him responsible has been about as successful as the paltry fines handed to the meat companies.  Technicalities, don't you know.
Wow. I pity workers in the US, you guys have no rights. And I’m saying this from Brazil.
Wow
With all due respect, usually John Oliver is good at provoding good solutions but this time, you messed up massively, sir! The underlying problem is so obvious and you never talked about it. The companies treat can treat their workers like that because customers want chicken for 2$ per pound twice a day. Just face the truth: if we want this much meat at such a low price things won't change. Just stop eating it or at least reduce drastically!
He continues to dance around the vegan/reduction in meat consumption elephant in the room. 😒
I lived in Greeley, Colorado for a few years. Due to the treatment of workers and animals, I became a vegetarian and have been now for almost 30 years. JBs was owned by the Monfort family, who also were owners of the Colorado  Rockies, baseball team. A professor of mine wrote a book detailing the abuse of the workers entitled "Meat Packers and Beef Barons". The problem was that the Monforts were the biggest benefactor to the University of Northern Colorado. She wrote the book, retired and quickly moved in fear of her own safety.
Charlie Manson had a family too.
Go vegan. The meat industry exploits animals, humans, the environment, and causes epidemics. If you care about any of those, stop eating meat.
Families can be abusive too....
Those comments on why go to the doctor, or not being allowed to go to another provider are the military in a nutshell, and I'm not saying that in a kind light.
Well. Go vegan?
"robot fuck a soup"   i about spat my out cackling
I worked on a factory line making cars in Japan. We couldn’t go to the toilet mid shift. Our breaks were scheduled every 2 hours for 5 mins and in some cases getting to the toilet and back took all that 5 mins. The cafeteria was a 15 min walk++ from my station and lunch was 1hr. Factory jobs are not easy and often require dexterity. Although safety was not an issue, the pay should have been better.
(Disclaimer.... I'm not a professional political researcher, I just did a quick google search)  Interesting to see that a show and network that decidedly leans left would pick the Chicken Industry to talked about this week.  And name only 4 companies (Tyson, Pilgrims Pride, Sanderson Farms, Perdue).  A quick search on FollowTheMoney.org shows that ALL 4 have contributed more to Republican candidates then Democratic candidates  Tyson Food (spanning 26 years) $1,000,000 to Rep. $600,000 Dem Pilgrims Pride (spanning 6 years) $110,000 to Rep. $5,000 Dem Sanderson Farms (spanning 7 years) $52,000 to Rep $5300 to Dem Perdue Farms (spanning 2 years) $6200 to Rep $200 to Dem  I'm not saying that the story itself is not factual.  I'm just saying that the targeting is ….interesting... Also interesting is that the company he focused the story on , is the one that gave the most to REP candidates. Wonder if any of his other "main stories" has this interesting tilt?????
*vegetarianism intensifies*
What a persistent whiner. Do you have a skill?
This show gets me so fired up 😂
This years season seems to be all about going vegan.
Same happens in Europe. There you can see how disgusting our "democracies" are...
noo...............this doesn't happen in America
Don't eat meat in this country. The animals are not slaughtered probably. That literally leaves bad blood in the meat.
Corporate dystopia anyone?
As a Texan, please, please, PLEASE do a story about the privatization of our power grid, how it screwed us over during this recent winter storm, and how we're now getting electric bills for THOUSANDS of dollars. PLEASE. 😟
Meatpacking...so I guess we're ignoring the failed coup
I was using an immersion blender on lentil soup at the exact same time John said "robo-fuck a soup".  _He knows_
John Oliver is like stupider Upton Sinclair.
When money is the bottom line...
Divorcing Healthcare from Employment is a necessity, employers shouldn't be able to leverage your personal health against you.
John had some very funny moments in this video.  I was laughing hard, despite the subject. 😆
USA land of the free!  * If you are not an employee. When you have enough money.
Many people are suggesting that we should go vegan in response to this, while it is a good idea the issue is it won’t magically solve the problem in the way we think, the companies affected will just lay off the workers and cut the few benefits the workers get and run off with their pockets full of cash. The one taking the fall won’t be the company it will be the workers
3rd world nation with 1st world weapons, stock exchange & services for those who can afford it.
“A bribe or an illegal  campaign contribution”  Oh so close to finding the problem... Oh well.
JBS moto is: a fraction for a fraction..
Finally, not a trump video. Missed this type of content John Oliver!
Go vegan! Do it for the people, the animals, and the environment. Get over your own ego and go vegan.
The title should have been “profits over people and the States who allow it”. State regulations are as much at fault as the Companies.
Please do an episode on the controversies of lyme disease!!!!
Nothings going to change.
That hand blender joke was cringe 😒
Ah the US, where labor can be described as when the older brother bullies the younger by having them do the chores instead of sharing the load.
As a vegan? I stand with this..
I used to be a forklift technician. Company sent me to a Tyson facility to catch up on some tickets. I made it three days before I quit. Most God awful facility I've never been through in all my life.
My dad worked at a Perdue plant. He slipped on a wet floor covered in entrails and split the back of his head open. He was sent to the hospital, but when he arrived, Purdue refused a workman's comp claim unless he took a drug test which they insisted had to be collected by the plant nurse. So he traveled with a head injury half an hour back to the plant to piss in a cup and then back to the hospital to staple his head back together. Since then, he has had major problems with his memory to the point that he couldn't retain his training for the job he pursued afterward.
Vegans "...it's happening"
Well fuck
My mom slung chickens for Tyson for 30 years. She got carpel tunnel in both wrists and retired. She received a pearl necklace for her 30+ years of dedication, it's fake. Just like Tyson and their love for their employees
until we all have "meat hands" we're celebrating the military industrial complex!
Oh man I thought this was going to be diseased meat from the conditions there.
Killer bunny scene from The Holy Grail
This is so true. All these people suffering just so one guy can build and buy the tackiest most worthless things on Earth.
"Blank 10,000 check" hey bro....... you do know blank check means the amount isnt filled in so you can make it whatever you want right? lolol
I have said this we need a new labor movement
Fuck, I feel physically ill.
In prison all we got to eat was guinea pigs and gruel
The love of money really is the root of all evil.
Laughing about the way the United States handle themselves helps me pretend that everything's fine here. Please, carry on.
Citizens need to stop playing nice with corporations, if they cannot treat their employees properly they deserve to be forcibly shut down. All their money forcibly relocated to their mistreated employees.  I used to work force because this is not voluntary.
Yes daddy pack that meat.
This episode doesn’t address the real problem.  All of his solutions would push the prices for goods up for consumers and no consumers want that.
We should make salaries of employees and contractors public knowledge as well as reports of working conditions. Let the consumer make choices. As well as increase OSHA x 100
This generates a two sided question:  how willing are stockholders to lose money to pay for improvements?  How willing are consumers to pay more to pay for improvements?  I’d pay more but that’s just me
#govegan
Upton Sinclair wrote "The Jungle" in 1906 leading to the FDA, yet not much has changed. Money talks, it always has, it always will.
I'm sorry wasn't a book written about this like, decades ago? Called The Jungle. About the piss poor conditions in the meat industry, and all people cared about was how much person was in their sausage and meat patties instead of the actual point of the book, that people working in these plants were treated like shit and put in harms way.
Lets not forget the Woke doctor who episode trying to say how humans need these jobs they make humans feel needed in valuable. While their episode was some warped attempt to attack amazon for adding automation weve hear all the horror stories about working at amazon which kinda makes you think we definitely need robots replacing more jobs
Yeah, so what? Nurses don't get bathroom breaks either.
But hey. Just eat this piece of meat. Two minutes of feeling good. Ruined dozens of lives, accelerated climate change, destroyed nature.  Ja I think it adds up..m
Most people have a skill others are willing to pay for: work for yourself... Corporate executives will always treat you like a piece of the machine-disposable... Unions are the employees only representative...
Well, unbridled capitalism at its finest. No need for regulations and worker care.
Wasn't he funny once upon a time?
Sharing
More OSHA workers means diluted bribes.
7:48 Why would immigrants be afraid to complain to the authorities? Now, if you’re an illegal immigrant, the you can’t, but just saying ‘immigrant’ makes one think they’re legal. But don’t worry, Biden will be making them legal. Then all will be fine and they can complain.
Should cover the plasma industry next
Still waiting on that Cuomo cover-up story.  Wonder if JO will have the stones to report on that one.
Another great reason to go vegetarian or vegan.
A second or third world country wearing a first world country's mask
They treat workers like shit
Also: processed/cleaned/packed vegetables and fish packing plants aren't much better places  to work. In case we get the ordinary vegans' comments here. It's a workers' rights' problem. Don't cancel it with animals' right issues.
Texas is the worst state 😤
Another good documentary that covers how crappy Tyson is, is Super size me 2 it shows how they even mistreat the chicken farmers.
Long live the Capitalism...
1. 5:40 - Literally the most disingenuous reporters I've seen. That's excluding Fox News of course, because their worst hosts are, by court admission, not news anchors or reporting anything that should taken as fact.  2. You don't have to smile into the camera ALL OF THE TIME, that's not how human beings behave.  3. The dark-skinned woman started to say 'OMG' before the middle woman had even finished saying "diaper". That's not only overdramatic as hell, but it was a lie to its core. She'd been reading the teleprompter the entire time and was just waiting for her chance at faux-outrage, but she lacks both the fraction of compassion or the acting skills required to fake it properly.  4. The woman on the left said, "Yeah. My mind is racing while you're sharing those details and thinking, 'surely, this is not in our country?' " Well, buckle the fuck up, Barbs. As John pointed out immediately, that is the most meaningless sentiment you could have offered. Perhaps "this is not the America..." as candidates used on the 2019-20 election trail might seem better, or even "i can't believe it... stuff like this shouldn't happen here" would have more emotion behind it. But the fact is this is the least among America's self-directed cruelties, but worse... "not in our country" or, as I rephrased, "shouldn't happen here [in America]", what exactly do they mean? Where is it okay for human laborers to be treated like machines, forced to work in chilling temperatures, working at unbelievable speeds and obligated to stay at their workstation regardless of their wellbeing until their entire line gets excused for 15 insufficient minutes so that their plant doesn't get audited by their nation's OSHA, if they even care enough about human rights to have a worker's safety entity? Where is it okay for employees to have no choice but to wear diapers, or strap bottles to their legs, or piss under the conveyors? Even in the US, where not all plants have submitted to the demands of their workers and allowed the formation and representation of a local union, we still find that meatpacking union chairs have been taking bribes from major producers to dismiss worker's abuse claims. Where is it okay for an employer to silence the safety and rights concerns of their workers?  If you're obligatory contribution to a tough conversation is 'i can't believe this is happening here', you fundamentally don't understand the question at hand.
Trilateral commission.
This guy now that he is a citizen actually is seeing our workspaces for what they are. He forgot to mention the waiver of benefits- the papers that say you are ok with half or less of your paycheck if you are disabled. You know the one they hand you when you go down to work because you are about to be evicted.
My aunt worked for Tyson about 15 years ago and got carpo tunnel in both hands. When she went to the work provided doctor they messed up her surgery. They denied her workers compensation saying it wasn't their fault her surgery was botched. She sued them and filed for disability because she had less than 10% function in one hand and 30% in the other. Thankfully she won her case but it took years to do so and she barely made it with her saved up money and help from family her hands are permanently ruined.
It looks like his eyes turn gold at 3:46
Blue-collar workers have been mistreated in this country for a long time? Wow, imagine that.
Is it any shock that the country founded on slavery loves paying slave wages and keeping their employees in terrible working conditions with no way to advance or save up enough money to start looking for new job
I don't live in America and I can't access American TV from where I live, so the fact that every John Oliver video starts with "Moving on" without telling what happened before deeply intrigues me. What's the rest of the show like?
"This is disgusting" That's not the America people think the know, that's the America in actual fact
Burn that fucking place down and anything else the owners own... Their mansions, yachts, club House's and any other illegal places they have slave labor where even the agencies that over see it are powerless to fix it and scared into wearing boxes over their heads so not to see anything. I'm sure this will get me red flagged. Again.
What if Judi Dench is your family ?
Disappointed this isn't an Adam Driver themed segment
This is ‘comedy’? 🙄
Yet another reason to go vegan.
So why the f*** do people work these jobs I wouldn't work a job like that you couldn't pay me enough money I'd rather be homeless everybody with a s*** job like this should just quit maybe something would change everybody's got to get on the same page here people that let themselves be subjected to this kind of crap are the enablers life is short there's no need to do this to yourself
Oo look Texas situation happening everyday..yes Republicans DO govern..we need more of this.. f..
American capitalism is so fucked up. You guys are literally a third world country by now.
Great jokes
Yet they don't want to wash chicken before cooking it...
These workers should just go on strike or walk out.  Seriously.
Anyone else binging this show in 3 days
From reading the comments Many of y’all are not ready to hold capitalism accountable and it shows
wait what the fuck?  no coronavirus or orange man bad stories?  The kind of content that I subscribed to him over 4 years ago for?  Jesus Christ it's a fucking miracle
sometimes it feels like the slave owners of civil war america never changed their ways, they just figured out the PR solution to cover it up.
I'm sure it would be beating a dead horse, but if they played this last season, they totally could have added Adam Driver to the list of animals that John Oliver would be a piece of meat for.
Support a local or small business butchery.
It seems to me that whenever a company wants to """""LOBBY"""""" legislators to relax restrictions, legislators should take the money and do the *EXACT OPPOSITE* of what that company asks for (or just ignore them, while still taking their money, because fuck billion dollar corporations, right up their fiscal ass).
Let's address the broad issue shall we; As long as Companies and Industries place profit above ALL other considerations this will continue to be the case. So again, unfettered Capitalism is the problem. Greed and elitism is rampant and it really needs to stop.
Can we get a meditation tabe by John Oliver? That would be myo ne chance to get into the practice. Also, this actually makes me consider limitin my meat more seriously.
I don't want to say it... But maybe the vegans were right
And that's why I get my meat from a butcher
America is a third world country with a fake gucci belt on
I have as much empathy for these workers as they do for the animals they are cutting up. I would never work there and for those people who tell me I would if I had to...People have choices, they are not children being told what to do by their parents. I would move. No money?  Maybe stop having support the kids by three different daddys or baby mammas. Working in a prison is a piece of cake compared to this. If people didnt eat meat this problem wouldnt even exist. That could solve so many problems but humans are so god damn selfish they only think about themselves. Thats why I prefer being with my non-human family over the family I was born into.
Zoonotic diseases, meatpacking plants... Is John Oliver going to surprise us at the end of this season by saying he's gone vegan? Yes, please.
The day people stop care about money, the day human will be better
If you want slavery just bring back slavery, all this dancing around pretending it's not slavery because we pay our workers, we value our workers, our workers are treated much better then slaves etc etc. If the government takes bribes from the companies don't be surprised when the companies use legal power to get away with moral injustices, it's in their motivation. Companies want profit because it is their lifeblood the same way we want to live and want to breath, a guy at such a company is literally looking at spreadsheets and being paid to make the number in the first column go up and the number in the second column go down, the method must be legal and that is the only limitation this man is given. The annoying and frustrating part is how many people can feign ignorance or be genuinely ignorant enough to believe everything is so great and the bad things only happen far away, that ignorance is reserved for children not adults.
Just taking a moment to preemptively express my regret at whatever I am about to learn before diving in.
Crazy how all you leftist shills push the same propaganda all at once....
I saw someone refer to the US as a developing nation with a Gucci belt on, this is why...
next episode: how to go vegan already
What can you do? 1) You can eat less meat. (You probably are consuming too many total calories a day also.) 2) You can actively seek out meat from local butchers and processors that are not giant corporations with giant factories. 3) You can actively support the issue of workplace safety.  Other ideas?
Or maybe.... hear me out.... stop financially supporting these companies
Should be called John Oliver: Making you lose complete hope in humanity one week at a time
Supervizors who are betting on the health of their workers.  Bosses: *Chuckle* they’re just like our children. No biggie.   Workers when they organise and unionise to protect themselves  Bosses: NOOO, THAT’S COMMUNISM! WHAT ABOUT OUR FAMILY VALUES!!!!
I’m not a vegetarian but I do believe in 100 years people will look back and think it was insane that we ate animals and raised them in confined spaces
The Land of the Free!!
I don't mean to say that we should stop eating animals...     But we should stop eating animals.
The other problem except companies are the consumers. This is capitalism. This is America.  Any tiny improvement on the production process will hit the end consumer. More bathroom breaks? Higher wages to pay, less productivity.   Slower lines? Higher wages to pay, less productivity.   Higher saftey standards may also mean more cost less production though it can also improve production if it actually solves a problem of people missing out on working, though I'm sure they've just estimated that it's just cheaper/more efficient to take the casualties instead of having better safe regulations which is grim but it is what it is.   And the list can go on, if a company WANTS to do all of this they HAVE TO raise the prices and will be gutted by the competitors , also the consumer just DOESNT CARE what happens in the factory or where/how the meat is coming from, if they can get the same cut for cheaper - they will.  Also, the people that work there unfortunately have no choice, i think its quite clear that 99.999% of the population would not want to work in a slaughterhouse or a meat factory, i mean why would you? This gives companies leverage to fire them, its much cheaper as they know someone else whos desperate will take their place anyway, this is a very wide issue impacted by imigration,education and other factors that wont be solved by companies following tighter regulations.   Change has to come from the consumer/the people as a whole, hoping that some regulators pick their shit up and that companies do the 'right thing' instead of aim for maximum profit is not sustainable.
imagine crying for meat industry workers while we force animals to live in their own shit
i think there might be an issue with capitalism
good, i only miss "low salaries" to complete my United States of China Bingo
John Oliver if you are so consented about people why aren’t you a socialist? Or are you a performer? I can’t decide. Considering I’ve never heard you meantion US imperialism it’s not a good look
To these people, life means nothing. Whether it's animal life, human life, or the consumer's life. They only care about the money and themselves. The only way this can stop, it's if we all stop contributing to their bank accounts. We should boycott these evil industries.They are ruining our health, the planet, and the animals.They have lobby's everywhere, that's why they can get away with it, and we need to act. It's fucking disgusting how they can tricks us to believe we actually need to eat the sick miserable corpses they sell us, without a care, because it's good for us. It's time we stand for ourselves and victims. Let's drain them out of their money. They are all the same. And they are only around because people who buy their products make them rich. Instead, let's give money to businesses that care about the planet, their workers, animals, the planet, and the consumers health.
WTF WAS THAT AD ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING?!
This is why I stopped eating meat over 10 years ago. For animal welfare reasons, but also human welfare. Not to mention the superbugs created from the waste pools, or how they ship chickens to China for processing then back to the US, the list goes on and on. I personally don't want any part of that grotesque circle of cruelty.
Every time I watch this show I am so glad that I live in Europe. I don't understand how can the majority of Americans think they are "special" and the USA is the best place to live. Like you have to ignore the world around you really hard to believe in this and I know they don't give a damn about the EU or the rest of the world but even living in Canada is like a million times better and they still ignore it. You will never get better in anything if you are already thinking that you are the best. And media and politicians are still reinforcing this myth of exceptionalism.
Karma I say, DONT KILL animals and be vegetarian! And did you miss all the chemicals the meat is lathered in before it gets on your plate? Also, does Oliver ever calls out Democrats, or is everything always Republicans fault? Just curious...
Yep they're a dysfunctional family
The race to the bottom might continue? From this report , it is already Upton Sinclair's Jungle!
My country is smaller than the USA x100 or maybe more but we have more than 10 major poultry companies and tons of small companies and farms + foreign companies .
I bet 6 out of 10 ppl work at a place like this
**WHOMEVER MADE THAT "COMMERCIAL" IS A GENIUS‼️ SO FAR AN ADDITIONAL 415K [COUNTING]  VIEWS ON THIS EPISODE HAVEN BEEN REACHED LOL!**
What a shithole
The way the US government regulates (or fails to regulate because they're bribed to do the opposite of what they should do) really shaped the culture in the US. Rich people have learned they can get away with any human right violations and abuse of poorer citizens without any consequences. That's how you create a society run by by sociopaths that benefits rich white folks
Another reason why I hate capitalism
Sickening but in no way surprising.
John likes meat packed in him
John, you should totally do a directed meditation 🧘‍♀️ I find your voice peaceful like the gentle ocean breeze on a sunset beach
Can't wait for your skits on Biden. Oh wait you're a Democrat
I think I have a solution (laughs... Then they die down) Make it illegal to have a certain amount of badly employed personnel. The ones at the top of all of those people arent badly payed. And they cant manage to have such a job Without so many people so badly employed. Instead of bragging the US stopped its slavery in the country, remember whats so bad about slavery anyway.
What if someone sues one or all of those companies, and then uses  this video 😂
John is just keeping on untangling the many horrible details of the American dream. Well done John
A perverted Owl..... just watches..... I saw what you did there John.....
yes, youtube commenters, this is about the same industry as that book you read in high school. you are very smart.
I want to be treated like a f@ck machine!
Eat up that soy, boys.  Emasculation is on the menu!
Wow, the US is basically a 3rd world country in regards to human rights. What a shocker! That painting of the peacocks though!
Plz plz plz do an video on India  Plz John
Ahh, the United States of America, you never disappoint
Im too afraid this will ruin meat for me. Never missed an episode but this one scares me.
Guillotine factories have  reopened in France. If you guys need some, we'd be happy to provide you for revolution a second time.
Money, money over everything. What a disgusting country.
I'm an experienced deer hunter.... it takes me and two other experienced hunters a few hours to break down a mid sized deer....
You must be heavily invested with gates.
Just stop eating animals and you will be less fat and less sick. Honestly. It works. Watch doctor Brooke Goldner.
It's not like capitalism cannot work, just look at Europe. However, the US exposes everyday what it looks like when capitalists are given almost free reign. Barely veiled 19th century inhumane shit. It also happens in Europe, but much more seldom and normally it draws stronger consequences.
Tyson employees a crapload of illegals where I live & it was the #1 Hotspot for cases in all the surrounding counties.  You know what'd help that? If we made them legal.
This was writen about in Fast Food Nation a decade ago.... Nothing has changed and nothing will...
**FYI- THAT AD WORKED LIKE A CHAMP‼️, BECAUSE NOW MILLIONS MORE WILL SEE IT ON THIS VIDEO😂‼️**
How close were the Managers with their numbers to the "covid dead pool"? Who won?
America, such a wonderful country...
Wait wtf?! Was that family going to eat the guinea pig?! 1:26 Wait wtf?! "Meatpacking" didn't already refer to packing people into an industry-building like in the picture?! My mind has been blown today.  So, Tyson really *is* a family. Just more in the sense that a family where dad locks mom and kids up in the basement and don't get to see the light of day of years on end, is also called a "family".  To be honest, I thought that Meatpacking was already taken over by machines.
The response by the federal government was weak...yeah no shit.  Trump basically fought a virus on Twitter thinking he'd win...we're still waiting on the virus to open an account for it's response.
The US is prepared for nothing but war. Not a pandemic, not natural disasters, not poverty, not homelessness, not human rights; I could go on for a day...
Nah man, that'll lead to Socialism and Communism. Can't have that.
Judy is a true treasure. 💜🥰
I sort of feel like we could really use a full episode on OSHA at this point.
The meat packing and meat industry is a strongly Republican controlled sector with a lot of anonymous donations going to Republican candidates this contributes to my ongoing theory that John Oliver is paid by the Democratic Party to push anti-Republican agenda... just a Siri from a politically neutral person
Can someone explain to me this value of “never called in sick in 30 years”.   What does that mean? Either he never got the flu, never got the common cold, never got strep, bronchitis, or any common reason someone has to reasonably call out sick OR he showed up to work with chicken WITH all of those.   This is not a jab against Saul, I wish he and others didn’t have to work in a system that valued them for working when they’re not well.
Ah. Underpaid, mistreated workers exploited by an oligopoly controlled by the ultra-rich, turning in billions in profit yet still trying to squeeze every last cent out of its most vulnerable employees. How classic. Basically Karl Marx's world view in "Communist Manifesto" all over again.  I'm still mad at how people like Stalin and Mao subverted such a admirable cause to their own lust for dictatorial power. It forever tarnished the reputation of communism (or maybe I should say socialism, given how negative of a connotation "communism" has managed to catch) gave capitalist elites a valid basis to oppose any policies advocating for workers' rights.  I wouldn't be surprised if some hard-line "small government advocate" starts calling you a "commie", as if that disproves any points made in this video. It's a sad and self-contradicting world we live in.
And imagine now Bidem open to all immigrants ,,, will have much more workers knock the door of this farms, and paying even less. Congratulations Biden hahahahahah
are they able/allowed to unionize?? or are they afraid to let john oliver say the bad socialist word
Has somebody here played "Oddworld: Abe’s Exoddus" ?
the one thing you are never told; You are a valuable asset, and you are easily replaced at the same time.
Wouldn't it be nice if there was something you could do to stop supporting this industry immediately? Hmmm, I wonder...
9:55 fuck, that guy looks like a damn pilgrim
This reminds me of a talk of Winnie Byanyima, the CEO of Oxfam at the Davos Economic Forum. She said we shouldn't be just blindly thankful to companies for creating jobs, but we need jobs that have dignity. Not being able to go to the bathroom and having to continue to work in your own urin/feces is not a dignified job. This needs to change especially when we know that company heads earn millions/billions while their employees suffer.
Love the “fuck it” cup on the desk of the frequently absent employee!
Welcome to another episode of How Shitty America Really Is
nothing is more slimy than your boss who makes more money than you... calling you “family”
A way out of this mess would be to make it easier for small butchers to open shop and actually  stay open. But it is super hard to compete with such an industry with ridicolous line speeds. Small diverse farm coupled with a lot of small butchers would stop this absolut mess.
The way America treats its workers makes it look like China cares more about worker welfare than the land of freedom.
Yes millions are homeless John, maybe do something about it?
When is this beta going to do a deep dive on urban criminality and why society doesn't hold certain groups of people accountable for their out of control victim culture. I can't wait. It might help lower the murders, rapes, assaults, thefts, etc.
Meat has just gotten even more disgusting. I will never understand why so many people eat so much meat, it's literally the most immoral industry in today's world.
Well maybe if you would talk to any libertarians, you'd realize that this is all good because they are making money and the market will decide.  Please talk you your libertarian friends, they keep wanting to talk to me and I need a break.
The 2020s.  First came plague, then came the reckoning.
working in in-store food production at a major grocery chain forced me to work at a pace where my hot reflex no longer works! my body no longer automatically jerks away from things that are burning me! and on top of that, I don’t feel that I’m being burnt until it’s bad enough to blister! so great!
5:15 the implicati9on that ms. piggy's sex tape includes acts of urination has not been corroborated.
Dear friends, i am from Iran. I want to say that US and Iran are arch enemies but now they are talking around one table. But belive me they never gonna sit in a negotiatiin table with their own workers. Believe me they are not gonna do that. All they want is not dead and not living workers just to handle jobs and accept and obey their comends.
Stop pretending this isn’t Capitalism working exactly as designed.
Tyson just fired me and told me they didn't have to tell me why. It was for the best because it's the worst company I've ever worked for.
Oh Texas seems like a horrible place but you can build a mansion for like a hundred thousand dollars 🙁
Great analysis John. I have a great solution everybody: STOP buying disgusting corpses from these hellholes! That you can personally control everytime you visit a supermarket. Seems easy right?
Ohh my god people in this country are feeling less and thats fucked up
I understand why they narrowed the focus for this episode but this isn't just a meatpacking problem unfortunately 💔
You’re still on the air?
Recommended music: The Fine Print by The Stupendium.
I think we need to push ctrl-alt-delete on the whole of the world and start over
I don’t mean to be weird here or anything, but.. isn’t his thumbs kinda long? Or the tips are pointy in a way? Totally off topic, sure, but still.
I knew when I saw that title that I there'd be some FIRE jokes
If your buisness is litarally killing metric tons of animals every day why would you care about your human working livestock.
Thank you John for showing another horrendous problem the people have been forced to deal with. This is truly disgusting and needs to change.
CAPITALISM, FUCK YEAH!!!/s  EDIT: Change murrrica to capitalism because it suits it more
Surprise. A job centered around torture and murder of sentient beings is also a terrible place for humans to work. Go vegan y'all.
"When we're dead and buried, our bones will keep hurting"  jesus that's grim
That sounds like slavery with extra steps
I know this isn't the point of this segment, but I can't help but feel a very real sense of irony whenever I hear about how understaffed OSHA is. It's there for the sole purpose of ensuring safe and functioning workplaces, but can barely do anything because they literally only have TWO inspectors in the entirety of some states. - Also, the one thing I find more depressing than OSHA and its ironically poor management is that some lawmaker not only thought it was a good idea to make rules where businesses can slap a blindfold on inspectors, BUT ACTUALLY SIGNED IT INTO LAW!!
Look in the mirror,  that’s the reason these places exist. 🤷‍♂️  Demand doesn’t give a fuck how supply gets it to them. Kids....children make iPhones.....did that stop any of you from buying?
Going vegan will not solely end this problem. It’s systemic and the people picking your vegetables are being exploited in the same way! Listen to John
Shitballs man... Where are the workers union in this matter? I'm not from the US, but don't you guys have a union, to protect the workers from their employers?
16:52 Evil John is possessed ! Jk: I love you shitpants
Here in Germany Covid also exposed terrible conditions in the meatpacking industry. We have since passed laws closing some loopholes. That will hopefully improve the conditions.
Please make an episode about "Last week tonight". I wonder about this workplace environment
Fudge Packing. The funniest summer job in Cornwall...
These people desperately  need a Union!
I think that guinea pig was rabid, but wtf was the point of that?
Another proof that the meat industry destroys not only animals but humans as well.
What is that dish Jim Perdue has in his hands called?
I love that the title 'Meatpacking' can nicely convert to 'ME at packing'.
Time and time again these examples show how degenerated large part of American society are; there is widespread racism, human rights abuses, corruption
We need a GameStop Stock video about Hedge funds vs the retail investors
honestly, the underlying problem here is that we got used to meat being a cheap everyday product and not a luxury.
This actually speaks to the overall organizational work culture in many American businesses. You need to understand on a companies bottom line their financial statements workers are viewed as a cost to do business.  No more no less. If you can reduce the cost to do business you make more money. That is how many businesses think. Forget innovating forget bring in new products into the market let’s just reduce our cost to do business get rid of healthcare keep wages as low as possible you get the picture.  Ironically some of the most innovative businesses in America some of the most successful businesses in various industries look to improve the workplace.  Look at how Costco dominates, look at HAL Aldi stanza cut above many of its competitors.  They don’t standalone when you start finding businesses that actually care about their employees that look to make healthy workplace is for people to work in that look to make a working Bierman to where people want to come to work for some reason I don’t know why but businesses do better.  For some reason you seem to get more out of your employees. Ironically we teach this in any business school especially at the graduate level but most businesses don’t follow these practices they write them down and claim to follow him but ironically when you start digging they don’t. Instead you get these false statements of love for the worker care for the worker false flags.
6:03 bitch it would ONLY be in your country or some other lost 3rd world country.. murica lel
unionize unionize unionize bring these companies to thier goddamn knees and not one of those weak knee unions no bring in the IWW them anarcho synidicalists know how to fight these battles
This what indian farmers are protesting against
The issue of fines for non-compliance with regulations being far less than the costs of compliance is widespread.  It would seem that a simple federal mandate that fines be levied in proportion to the costs of compliance might have some actual impact on companies deciding to game the system and pay the fines instead of running their business in compliance with the regulations they are supposed to be working under. For example if a factory is found to be out of compliance with safety regulations, then an independent contractor could be brought in to determine the costs of bringing the factory up to compliance.  The fine levied should be double the cost of the costs of bringing the factory up to compliance, and that fine should be applied for every single time the factory is found to be out of compliance.
John Oliver is on a rage crusade against meat lately, and I'm all for it  (ง▀ ͜͞ʖ▀)ง
16:48 that is the totality  of the American  capitalist  consensus
Was that a real commercial?
Just chiming in to say that the situation here in Germany is exactly the same. Down to the meat factories that had to shut down because of COVID outbreaks... :-(
Why am I watching this i do not even live in the USA i do not care
9:14 That performance rating clipboard pisses me off on so many levels.  Remember kids, if you're anywhere below average for any reason whatsoever, you suck at everything and dont deserve food or shelter.  We need to switch to lab grown meats as soon as possible.
Freedom in the US: freedom to exploit and scam others, freedom from health care and freedom to bear arms. Great. I rather enjoy the freedom of a "socialist" country like Germany, where people have the freedom to live without having to worry to be shot, to be ruined by illness and the freedom from slavery-like conditions (well, not as bad as shown here, at least).
How the hell is Perdue taking part in half the shit in this world?
This guy should just say I want big government, here is selective evidence to convince idiots to vote democratic.
Humane Hancock on YouTube is making a dokumentary on this topic in the UK, so feel free to go support it and watch it. Big shout out 😊. It’s called the dying trade.
Well I'm never going to buy Tyson again
Let’s unpack this.  My black friend used to work in one of Tyson’s fulfillment centers in the southeastern United States of America.  He said the room was always kept at below freezing temperatures while carving on frozen poultry.  He left them to join the United States Marine Corps and take it easy. 🤣
Old background looked cool. This sucks
I used to work in the meat industry.... I can tell you.... this is nothing...
chemical plants are damn near the same. injuries include just getting cancer or run over by a chemical trailer and the work hours and garbage management are equally atrocious
Go vegan or support human and animal slavery
For some reason I thought meatpacking was gonna be some new sex thing
Tyson always reminded me of Vought.
USA really is a third world country. How you treat your own people, but sundays you are all forgiven in your shitty church, aren't you.
No company should employ a nurse unless they are a healthcare providing business. Healthcare shouldn't be a business in the first place but yeah x.x I really don't get how corruption can be this bad and nothing is done about it :/ anyone with an injury but especially a life altering one shouldn't have to fight for the people responsible to take care of them. This is what happens when companies make the laws and the only way to get money you are owed is suing which costs money you don't have because they kept it from you with garbage wages and benefits. Fines don't work unless it's percentage of profit not just a flat dumb number. Also If you get covid and all you do is work it is work related you awful awful companies and people deciding this is okay. Most of these make me very angry but this one just hurts. The only reason these people are hurting is someone else pure greed and that's what a real monster is.
When they you treat the employees like this imagine how awful it is for the animals.
And we consumers are so greedy on the cheap meat. That is what you get on the quality
it kills me that companies can get away w just having a guy that slaps a band aid on you and convinces you not to complain when injured. I work in an area that has been swarmed by shipping/warehousing companies such as fedex. everybody here has worked ar fedex before loading trucks and such, and they do that too. I know many, MANY people who have been severely injured working in this sector of town, including people in literal back braces that still go in to do manual labor.
I wish DEA and FCC were as bad as OSHA. In particular, DEA ofc.
Is it totally non-sense to see this and think : "The search of profits at this level is bad" ?
This segment is a modern-era incarnation of Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle. This deserves a Pulitzer.
I think what any workplace that has a hazard that could kill or cause a serious injury to any worker should be around 1% of sales of what that workplace generates yearly and during a period of 1-2 months they can't fire any of their workers and has to pay for any medical bills caused by that hazard
So the US is increasingly becoming a husk, a hollowed out shell of the concepts of democracy, liberty and inalienable human rights, feasting upon itself from within in the forms of ... - unregulated industry  - predatory lenders - multilevel marketing  - profit-driven healthcare - corporate lobbying  - underfunded education  - the private prison system  - biased policing and justice system - crumbling infrastructure  - ...  Have I got that right?
This is America...so fucking sad, but very upsetting to know that these people choose profits over people😠😠😠
"robot fuck a soup" 👌
On Nuano anngono
I've worked in a number of corporations. As soon as a manager calls me family or even a team member I have to struggle to contain my laugh. Those are just euphemisms.
The unsightly south america amazingly kick because competition anaerobically tempt notwithstanding a zippy baby. squealing, kind menu
So happy I live in a country with unionized workplace
i thought this is on Xinjiang, but....  So USA still doing Slavery too huh!? " That's is Disgusting..."  Oh yeah even Biden Govt. is care more on China worker then their own country workers... Maybe OSHA can start flaming china industry, so those peoples currently seat at capitol might give you more funding 😂😂
Oh goodness, that was the news station that I watch
Bet you money that there are already 58 lawsuits againts John Oliver during the first 5 hours of this video being posted.
I'm so glad Sad Facts With Pasty Englishman is back!
Funny how Americans still call factories in Asia sweatshops while those in their backyard are actually the real definition of it.
Man I work at a packing plant, I wish I could share some of the stories I have. But I need the job.
The worst part about this is that boycotting these industries like going vegan or whatever will mostly only hurt the workers who will likely get laid off and be jobless while the owners can just find another venture without losing their prestige. And the resulting price hikes for meat won't hurt the rich, it'll just be too expensive for poor people who might need the calories to live somewhat healthy.
Rich scummy corporations taking advantage of people in need? .. What?!
If this is not modern-day slavery I don't know what is.
Oh wow, halleluja. Finally sb pays some attention to what the employees of the meet packaging facilities live through and how they are treated. I thought there were no media and reporters who wouldn't care more about cows, pigs and chickens than about their fellow humans. Now, we must find a way to get western Europeans to see humans in the people who provide basic goods for them.
The meat industry is unethical to its core? Noooo 😒
Why do you love capitalism that much? No,  not every alternative is "communism"
Dangerous working condition just like Amazon  AMAzone vlog2
America is just too far gone
I wish there was some way to track the effect of this show's videos. Does it even help at all? I'm watching from South Africa and from here it looks pretty bleak
Boycott Tyson!!
Wow. Just goes to show how money makes the world go round. You can do anything if you have enough money.
EAT PLANTS AND CALL YOUR LOCAL REP TO END ANIMAL FOOD SUBSIDIES!
Waterloo, I was defeated at Waterloo...
Meat industry is one of the shadiest industries in the world man and this is what happens when you have no govt regulation on corporates
Makes me think of Upton Sinclair book, The Jungle.  Upton Sinclair was a Socialist btw.  Same as Einstein, MLK, George Orwell, Woodie Guthrie, Thomas Paine "Founding Father" among hundreds of other hidden from history influencing people.
I think I'm going to have chicken Parmesan tonight
The jungle. Nothing has changed.
They know that Americans are too reliant on these companies for them to face any serious consequences that would hurt their business and they take full advantage of it. Not only in this industry but all across the board.
Capitalism at it's finest
Treating your employees like “family” is rich white guy talk for doesn’t get paid for overtime or mandatory work on the weekends.
STOP THE SUBSIDIZATION OF INDUSTRIES THAT ARE KILLING US AND BRING ON CLIMATE CHANGE FASTER!
Shit on top of shit... And I guess this country is going to shit too.
Wow
This is why The American Dream is dead. These workers need to stay home then.
This show is such a good reminder how fortunate I am to not live in the US. I'm just surprised not more people choose to emigrate from it. Is it that most can't afford to or is it because some patriotic feeling of duty to try and make the place better?
First world country my ass
as a European I love the USA show from time to time. I don't like how Europe deals with stuff but than I see the USA and i'm glad to be here.
free market capitalism in its splendor.
Is there anything and I mean anything that is not fucked up in the US?  For the record: In Germany we had outbreaks of COVID-19 too in the meatpacking plants.
I’m so glad I live in the EU, mandatory paid vacation for everyone, minimum wage (which is bad but at least exists) and paid sick leave. Good grief, and I used to think the USA was cool because they were rich and had their ahit together
Hans Blitz?
If you hear a Mexican say he wants to see a doctor, then you know things are bad. Us Mexicans will usually just fix ourselves. I saw my dad patch a cut with a spiderweb from a corner.
I guess I'm happy to live in village. No packing just go & buy.
yet again an example how broken the US system is
uuuugh yay time for my weekly dose of depression
Make meat more expensive
The meat packing industry has obviously been making many many "campaign donations" if they can get away with writing their own rules.
Which people dislike videos like this? You  watch how corporations shit on the most vulnerable people and you go like, "yeah, I sympathize with the billion-dollar companies"
capitalism must end
If a law enforcement officer is pursuing a suspect, they are allowed to seize anything they happen to see in plain sight (guns, drugs, incriminating documents, etc.) as evidence, even if it is unrelated to the individual they are pursuing. This is referred to as an exegent circumstance, and does not require a warrant, and is not considered a violation of the rights of the accused.  So tell me how in the unholy fuck the same doesn't carry over for OSHA, to the point where they can literally be told to put a box on their heads and ignore outright violations happening right next to them under threat of a lawsuit, purely because these violations are not the specific purpose for their inspection.
<3
Robot fuck a soup.
Meat packing sounds like what Oliver does with Biden and Pelosi.
meat processing plants the world over have been covid hotspots, lets go vegan people!
Just in case someone was wondering - 0.00003% would be equivalent to a 3 cent fine for someone on $100,000 a year. When the punishment is a fine, the law only exists for the lower classes.
"Surely this is NOT in our country" America is like two different countries: one for the rich, and one for the poor. This reaction shows that perfectly.
Sometimes i forget, that this is an american show, because if it weren´t, this topic could be even better applied to the european meatpacking industry (namely germany).
meat industry is just terrible
The next time someone says that vegans exploit workers who pick fruit and vegetables, I'm sending them this video.
...so...what’s our government doing about this?
"lost a body part OR was sent to the hospital", who phrased this
Why does he say "moving on" at the beginning? Is there more to this somewhere?
Does anyone in this comment thread want to work for a factory? No. The same way none of you would prefer to be a cashier yet here we are. They are jobs that need to be done, so you can eat your wings and buy buy buy. When people compliment my cashiering it literally doesn’t even register (lol) in my head. “You are a good robot!” Is all I hear.
Laughs in vegetarian.
besides being hilarious, thank you for using your platform to always stand up for the under privileged.
This is why America needs immigrants.
Jesus dude. Is it possible to be a more obvious shill for your billionaire oligarch? One who has coincidentally recently become the worlds largest owner of farmland and started pushing meat substitutes.
Upton Sinclair - The Jungle: The Second C_ming.
So many reasons not to eat meat from industrial meat production. Amazing that people just close their eyes and imagine they are not eating feces and urine from livestock, let alone humans. Then there is the treatment of workers.
The only companies that can say "we are a family" are the ones with less than a 100 employees and the boss or someone up in the chain knows every single employees name and loving conditions. These sort of companies actually exist and they don't have to say the company is a family their own employees say it without coercion.
That is what you would expect from the world capital of Capitalism. Mccarthy is laughing at all this, looking at the thriving red scare he helped create is still around, making sure the work force is being well exploited and spitting in the face of the solution.  Unionise and don't expect the Democrats to do anything for you.
Land of the free wow.
You know, even if this video is not about sustainability and meat consumption effecting the environment, after watching this, as a vegetarian, I don't think I am going to start eating meat again any time soon.   Every time I get new confirmations that this system is wrong, not only for environment and animals, but for humans too........
Is this the outrage machine? Because it’s fucking working.
If Tyson are a family they are the Manson family
That's funny how USA are always more dystopian than Europe... And at the same time are always criticizing how "socialist" Europe is... The grass is always greener on the other side... Except in USA.
Terrible working conditions, low wages, inhumane treatment of animals, low quality meat output at low price, high meat consumption, obesity and other chronic diseases. Why keep this loop? MONEY!
same here in germany
I wish I'd known he was doing this, because I have a ton of Natty Beef stories. My grandma and I both worked there and she was injured and made to sign a paper saying it was her fault so they could duck out of helping her. And they fired the sweet safety guy because he felt wrong screwing the employees.
🐹🐹🐹🐹🐹
God bless i live in italy and eating zero KM (or miles for you strange people)
Mr. Oliver, please help! Attempted murder. Ignorance and arrogance. Lawyers love money and perceived power. Garant vs Norfolk Southern Railroad. After being hired in 2011 and telling the physical doctor that I may have M.S. and after being approved for FMLA in 2015 for possible M.S., then fired in 2016 for possible M.S. and with such a rush, attempted to cancel medical insurance for my family and I a month before they were allowed legally, and expecting I die without medical aid as a result of their actions. What is M.S. and how is M.S. diagnosed, with what certainty, if there is no test, everybody might have M.S
Americans are letting their country be destroyed by greed, arrogance and racism.
Ladies & gentlemen, this is what you get with unregulated capitalism.
America isn’t a country, it’s a shell company owned and controlled by large, multinational corporations.
it's the American way, and self regulation is the obsessive fetisj of the Republicans, yet people vote massively from them - so it's down to themselves
Healthcare professionals working at this standard in the meat industry should have their board membership revoked and diplomas stripped.
Hard to feel sorry for the humans in this story...
Great reporting.
Going back to normal shouldn't be the goal at all!  We need to change the way we produce our food and we definitely need to change the way we eat. More than one year ago, we produced a "What Can I Do" video, regarding our eating habits. Since then absolutely nothing has changed, things even got worse. We're in the middle of a pandemic and it's now more important than ever that we focus on a diet that's both, good for humans and the planet.
Same thing over here in Germany. Stopped eating Meat because of that.
It's sad knowing most people are going to watch this and have the same attitude as those women on that show and think yeah they should just go somewhere else if it's so bad, but for someone who also works at an evil corporate warehouse I still work and get injured often because of the pay and knowing if I leave I won't be paid nearly enough to pay rent or afford bills and car payments so I feel trapped and have to suck it up so I don't become homeless.
I may be wrong about this, but that bit about Tyson Managers taking bets about how many people catch Covid may have been taken out of context. Ive seen similar situations at my factory. Unlike Tyson, the company I work for actually does take care of its employees. They pay us for the first 84 hours out of work for Covid and when they started offering this, all of a sudden half the plant had covid at once and we were understaffed and over worked. Just like CEO’s, most regular people have no integrity either. The company implemented masks and social distancing early on and yes we have had people get sick. Most of it was people taking advantage of the company and taking 2 fucking weeks off while others are actually sick. This put a lot of stress on the rest of us who show up for work. This led to Leads and Supervisors jokingly betting on how many people would be out of work this week, or out again. We’ve literally had an employee get Covid 5 times now.
Im so glad I dont live in the US. Cheers from Hungary
They should have mentioned how the Lump 'administration' allowed a speed up of lines, making it even more dangerous.
Labor unions & regulations don't seem so bad do they?
This is heartbreaking! But, please, I'm begging y'all, don't be fooled by reforms of the system -- if the federal government strengthened OSHA, it could weaken it again in the next administration. OSHA was created *because* organized workers demanded measures and bullied the political system into introducing the Occupational Safety and Health Act, just to reduce the threat of workers becoming too angry (of course, the OSHA was designed to be too weak to truly enforce anything). The decline of the unions and the decrease in OSHA inspectors and funding is not a coincidence.
Homework assignment: see the movie: Supersize me 2.  Really puts chicken manufacturing in a bad light.
So a bunch of Karens get to do yoga during their breaks while complaining about immigrants doing backbreaking work for the same company. What a surprise.
Typical liberal perspective - progress is worth no risk.
It's not only a problem in US. Here in Germany the conditions are similar bad in the meat industry.
17:26 We could eat the rich though
People need to read "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair again.  This just sounds like the cycle of worker abuse at the hands of monied corporations has happened all over again.
Hella vegetarian now, not just for the animals, but for my fellow HUMANS
Usually when I watch LWT I'm immediately another member of the public, shocked and mad that these things happen, waving my finger in anger. As for this one, not so much, because I feel the hypocrisy is just overwhelming. Situations like these exist because there is demand from the public for this product and no one really cares if it happens as long as they still get their product. Same with cell phones and those nets set up outside factory windows so workers won't jump to their deaths. Same with the clothing industry that's poisoning entire communities and polluting water supplies and destroying ecosystems.  The truth is the public clutches their pearls in indignation, becomes angry for 5 minutes and then proceeds to order a burger using their iPhones, and then goes on to spend some money on cheap clothing made in a nation where workers make single digits and work in horrid conditions, just so you get that cute top that you'll wear twice and then throw out, at an extra low price. The public is feeding these industries, it's providing the demand for those 5 processed birds in 10 seconds. Most of the people watching this are going to have some kind of meat product in their meal at least TWICE today and never think about what they learned here ever again. Taking action means giving up something they consider a right, even while knowing how much is costs in human terms - or ,* gasp * , in terms of dignity and suffering of the creatures you are consuming. How about doing something radical like... eating less meat? According to the laws of economics you won't have so much supply if the demand dwindles. You won't be feeding these fortunes made over both people's and animals' suffering if you just stop wanting so much meat in your diet.  The meat industry is a disaster on all fronts, including what we've just seen here, the obvious disgusting treatment the animals get before and while they're being slaughtered, the environment because the industry itself is obscenely polluting, the ridiculous resources farming animals consumes... But you just won't give up those chicken wings or that burger. I haven't had any meat in 15 years and I'm still kicking. And anyone who is reading this doesn't need to give it up completely. Just eat less of it. if. Everyone cut their meat eating to half it wouldn't be too hard to imagine the impact this would have on the whole. Stop pushing responsibility to the suppliers and remember, they're doing this because no one is willing to make the right decision and stop giving them reasons to keep giving you a steady, continuous and very cheap source of their product.
The ritzy betty reassuringly terrify because century yearly match within a narrow bomb. discreet, stimulating astronomy
United States of Corporations
So basically SLAVERY
The corporate agenda to foist fake meat and poor health on the public is real.
And yet I'm sure there are people who will justify this "incidents" as minor inconveniences needed to keep the price of the meat low, and to boost the economy.
US citizens don't care. God forbid 'communist' ideas like government oversight on workers' rights would be implemented. US citizens care more about meat on their plates.
I work for a corporate cannabis company in one of their factories and a lot of the practices discussed here are exactly the same. The corporation is led by people from the country’s largest corporations. They dont give two shits about people who work in production, but they treat corporate employees like the bougie pieces of shit that they are.
Upton Oliver! My man
The problem in America is the big businesses and the legalised bribing they do called lobbying with the scammy politicians y'all elect from only two lying parties
17:24, John Oliver: "So what can we do here?"  Me: "Ahem, how about adapting our diet?"  It feels kind of strange to me that Last Week Tonight has now covered for the second time in a row a topic that is so much related to what we have on our plates without really dropping the truth bomb:  A plantbased diet would solve most of the problems described in the meatpacking segment as well as "the next pandemic" episode.
Judy Dench was in Cats, she's not a treasure after that!
Imagine a system where you doesnt even have to rely on your employer to be able to visit a doctor
So many portraited problems start with "in the hands of these 4 companies" and end with almost no regulations. Why is the usa celebrating independence every year when it was obviously a bad idea?
This season is really making me want to go vegan
In Germany we had a similar incident at the Tönnies meat processing plant.
Around 5 times during this video I thought John would allude to Adam Driver. I am disappointed
11:05 I'll never understand the appeal of having a bathroom, let alone any room, look like that.
My mother died in a factory accident. Osha fined them 7k
Just more privileged white Americans who can't empathize with minorities or refuse to acknowledge the dark underbelly of their beloved America.
John Oliver Sucks
Don't worry, in a few more years, you won't have to complain. They will just spend R&D money in robotize every single line worker. Manufacturing wet dream.
Wow John!!.... Absolutely loving the new theme!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼 Even though you look like a sociopath leering at me from some creepy corner! 🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️😳😲😅
Well, last time I am buying Tyson..... not sure what kind of "meat" I would be getting. Ick.
Watching this while eating a burger.
As childish as it sounds, sometimes John Oliver's takes on stories manages to make me nervously chuckle but nah not this time, this stuff was just way too uncomfortable as it should be.  Not vegan but this choice to eat meat coming from places like Tyson and more under their current degrading practices makes Hannibal look more ethically swell with everyday.
America is the prove that pure capitalism is determined to fail.
An industry that is based on violence and unnecessary murder of sentient beings is also mistreating their employees? How surprising. Missed chance to hold consumers accountable. If we ate significantly less / or no meat, the jobs could shift to the production of plant products. No risks for pandemics, antibiotics resistance and injuries. But instead we subsidize meat to make it even cheaper and therefore increase demand artificially BECAUSE WE WANT FU**ing PORK CHOPS AND CHICKEN WINGS
So, what do we do as customers?  Other than going to a butcher, how do we buy chicken that is raised ethically, butchered by employees who are treated ethically, and isn't overly expensive?  This is a genuine question, no sarcasm intended.
NOPE! I don't trust anyone that calls their employees family. Without watching the rest of the show I can already tell Tyson exploits their workers.
The rustic tortoise acromegaly prevent because north bodily depend along a ill tax. ajar, energetic distributor
not sure if Dame Dench went down or up on my list since cats.
This is your unregulated free market, conservatives. IS THIS WORKING FOR YOU?!
Fxxx off, our heartless capitalism is as sacred as our democracy. We are the beacons of the world.
Upton Sinclair singing welcome to the jungle from his grave
This is part of the reason I went vegan 10 years ago. I watched something talking about the trauma meat packing employed go through. *ive been vegetarian my whole life
As a european, I must say this is because americans insist on buying cheap food. If the majority paid more for food and less for other crap, this would support high quality food processors
Disgusting
Unregulated capitalism is the best! The USA is the greatest country on earth!  This country's denial is costing lifes, making people homeless and preventing improvement.
I left meat, and now my more healthy and also helped me to lose weight
The amount of cognitive dissonance in this comment section in regards to the lives of the most vulnerable living beings on this planet, is absolutely astounding. How can you people sit and talk amongst yourselves as if factory farming isn't the most insane and brutal system of oppression to ever exist?
What the f is this ad. Can you do a piece about the ... weird world of advertisement?
Awesome
In the late 90’s my mom worked as a nurse in a pork processing plant in southern IA.  The stories she came home with were horrific.  In the community it’s pretty much common knowledge that the only people who work at the plant are undocumented immigrants because they are the only ones who would put up with the conditions.   They simply have no way to fight back and it’s been like this for decades.
Most of those companies are part of Tysons lol
Repeal citizens United.
Too late, too  little.... dont matter... life and the world is fucked up and disgusting... covid did a fucking bad job...should have wiped the planet of all humans...  what a disappointment... waiting for the next supervirus or the asteroid.... let the world live in PEACE...
Every time I scroll past this video in my sub box I keep thinking the title says Mansplaining 💀💀💀
congrats to America, i thought noone from developed countries can beat Germany in shitty condition in the meat industry, however america mangage to it again. but only due to the medical situation, Germany is more sinister getting the money back from their workers ...
Back in the 1970s my grandmother worked at a chicken plant, in Arkansas. The town had only 2 real options - the chicken plant, or the dress factory - and both were horrid. The dress factory paid less, and hired minorities, the chicken plant paid a little more, and hired white people.  When my grandmother hurt her back on the line, she was let go.  On the plus side we still have numerous chicken shears, over 40 years later. Terrible working conditions but great scissors!
In one week I'd better be resting upon my new island home! With all new teeth and my chest fixed like that of the sexiest man! Or prepare war!
Its just like republicans have been pushing for deregulation for years!
Please stop eating meat. It's the only way to stop these insane practices.
When it comes to accounting (where assets are numerically quantified), employees are literally not assets. They are expenses. No company wants expenses. If they can get rid of expenses, they will.
Yes, Judi Dench... and watching owls. However, I must introject about companies taking action to improve well-being of incidental interacting human beings? poultry, youtube... US, anywhere else. It`s not exactly... contained.
In Germany one of the biggest outbreaks we had in last summer was in this sector. Over a thousand workers in just one fucking factory. We have all the same problems as in the US, exploitation of cheap workers from eastern Europe...   Go vegan and hope these fuckers go bankrupt ;)
12:42 ----> HEY LOOK EVERYONE! It's a herd of Karens in their natural habitat xD
This is why you need unions y'all
I haven’t eaten meat in almost 10 years. I sure as shit am never going back now. What horrible companies 😢
Sadly, we have exactly the same problem in Germany
i mean look...most of these complaints are 1000% true to this day. I worked at a smaller Tyson plant for 2 years and now work at Walmart. I got paid more, had better benefits, knew my supervisors better and felt better trained from day one. If they built another plant where i now live i would work there again day one.
Starts talking about meatpacking Me: oh maybe he's talking about a COVID outbreak in a German company called Tönnies. Join Oliver mentioned USA Me: here we go could not be worse than in Germany Scenes about workers who can't take toilette break and wearing diapers, about bets and medical issues.  Me: WHAT THE F**** !!!!
Is he supposed to be funny...get some new writers yikes
Where is Upton Sinclair?  Now I’ll be a vegetarian for a few days.  Thanks John Oliver.
America, ever heard of a labor union?
This is what you get if you don't have a socialistic system . Capitalism is the same as communism , this is not posible in the Netherlands , we have a social democratic system and you have a big voice in your work
I'm here to remember you that "Modern Times" (from Charlie Chaplin) came out in 1936 and let you figuring out which segment I'm referring...
Thanks, John, for showing how miserable life is in the US for average folks... Now I have more appreciation for my own shitty, but not nearly as shitty, country.
Yeah, I've gotten the impression that a lot of industry is indistinguishable from medieval serfdom.
America and it's anarcho capitalism
As someone who works at a major factory in health and safety... There's a lot I'm glad we seem to be doing better at accomplishing. But I can assure you workers comp is the biggest lie in manufacturing. The system is designed so you can't benefit from it without extremely gross negligence on the company's part. But we do absolutely have dozens of people try to play the system every month too.
I refuse to remain poor! Announce for me world wide publicly! My throne awaits me! I want it placed upon my own personal island! Along with every single great thing this world has to offer a man! Set one Trillion US currency dollars on my island! And I'm not asking anyone anywhere for anything! For the whole earth is mine! You have one full week from right now!
Yeaaaaah. No, no i doubt anything will ever change until we get a Donald Trump type of president that doesn't give a F and finds a way to make things happen. But you know without all the lies, racism and bile.
Because of course, Waterloo Iowa is in the news for the wrong reasons. Back in my day, we called that town The Place The Light Doesn't Touch
https://youtu.be/kQ9qsVcHnx4
USA is a corporatist state where only money matters. All the while you have super strict moral codes for appearance's sake. I mean what would Jesus say?
it's the same in any part of industry, especially food production, that's been taken over by globalist corporations, from the field to your table, we that do the work are nothing but indentured workers.
John Oliver working on his new book "The Jungle: Part 2"
Ooh boy! Who Is john Oliver going to get me 2 absolutely loathe this weekend!? Chicken - les doit bruh!
And people are still proud to buy "made in America" products...
Go vegan, save animals AND humans.
This makes me appreciate our strict workers rights in Germany even more.
The scientific shampoo endosonographically remain because golf ostensibly arrest to a hungry engine. wrong, tremendous aquarius
sadly, people will agree with this, and yet:  they'll REFUSE to see where their fast-food meat comes from.
This industry needs to be robotized. Those "jobs" are inhuman.
Olha  JBS ali... Brazil fucking up the US heuheuheuheuhe
This is why unions are important.
This proves that United States of America is worst like a Third World Country. Such a shit hole country.
Workers have been getting shafted for so long. And they just sit and take it. Needs to be country wide workers strikes. No power to the people of the people don’t take power.
I thought this was comedy show.
Unless we make SERIOUS fucking changes this will be morr and more common. We are being nudged every day to less safety, less pay, less benefits, more hours, and lower standards. This is our current reality.
'MURICA. The greatest country in the world. The envy of the world. Loooooooooooooooooool
Yup, just another reason to say "F*CK TEXAS! Just F*CK TEXAS!!" Such a stupid place, full of people voting against their own damned interests!!! Just a ridiculous stereotype gone wrong down there, so crappy for no reason!!
I most countries if your company force you to sign against your rights... it is a void agreement.
Very messed up. Maybe highlight the ridiculous amount of work and time youth social workers, case managers, floor staff in treatment facilities do and the astonishingly low amount they are paid. People working in the mental health field are often taken advantage of, underpaid, and ridiculed by other levels of the judicial system. But yet, its for the kids and we should just take it. Im sure its everyones life dream to be degraded and berated by the kids and people you work with.
John I have to disagree   I quite like the foyer
Hope you present a bit of info in about the farmers' protests in India, if that's ok. We need unbiased outsider objectivity on that one too.
For everyone planning to eat meat after this video in sorry for you, anyways I'm gonna enjoy my morning star veggie sausage now!
The fact that American judges uphold a waiver that was signed under immense pressure, tells you enough about the American justice system
What's new some hypocrite libral saying meat is bad and u don't get paid enough and he is Rich eating all and everything just  pass the ubi
Lolololol.  I've worked at a Tyson plant and can tell you that they don't give a flying fuck about a single one of their employees.  Like, at all.  I don't think I ever heard a single person even suggest that the company cared about anyone that wasn't management.  Pretty much everybody thought the exact opposite. In fact, I've never worked at a company that actually cared about its employees.  I mean, all of them have claimed to.  But the reality is that they are genuinely surprised when you point out the low morale, constant mismanagement issues, and employees being blatantly ignored.  And when these problems are actually brought to light by somebody willing to tell management that management sucks, management fires the person and then throws a pizza party and is fucking stunned when morale doesn't improve. The management in this country has literally 0 leadership skills.  They think they can just use their rank to order people around because of paychecks and what-not.  And we wonder why all these companies just absolutely suck at moving along.
This is just Capitalism. No amount of regulation or oversight can fix it, when Capitalism *FUNDAMENTALLY* values profit over human life.
John Oliver is the best
Everything else aside, it's very nice to see an episode that's not about the immediate danger in the news like we've had for the past two years straight. Covid. Elections. Border walls. He who shall not be named. It's good to be back to random stuff.
I worked for an pork pricing plant and ya it's like that  revealing dore and hurts your hands  10sc to bone an pork but
I think that them calling their employees "family" really only shows that they hate their families.
The US, a 3rd world country in the making.
This country was built this way....
Hence need tariffs and regulations. Because if you apply regulations without tariffs, guess what, next year all the meat products will come from China. Like I like this show but it's just so narrow minded.
I am from Iran and living in China , but this is somehow one of the most depressing videos I ever watched
Uumm yeah the title definitely spoiled the ads 😂
It's not the best choice, it's USA CHOICE!
Go vegan, tax the rich, implement universal basic income.
Republicans love cutting taxes so government can't fund agencies who enforce regulations that hinder growth and profits. Anyone who is against regulations are just putting their own greed first and kicking the responsibility down the line to someone else.
Sorry I was just daydreaming about all of these workers going on strike.
Last week to Tonight’s motto week to week:   That was sad, let’s keep it sad.
Are we not gonna acknowledge that Bo Pilgrim has a disturbingly small face?
Who would know? Immigrants when illegal can be exploited and blackmailed by the industry? Well, dear Oliver you spent 4 year fighting the administration that wanted to solve this. Now you can enjoy your steak thanks to the ever flowing river of illegal imigrants feeding industries like this with fresh cheap labour. Or a glass of fresh orange juice comming from farms in California? What a hipocrit!
Holy shit... This is fucking terrible ! I am completely pissed off. Everything from energy to food to vaccines is a God Damn mess . Really overshadows a landing on Mars. Way to go America. Land of the rich. Home of the slave. Thank you for your reporting. I dig the show even if it hurts. This hurts. 2000 dollar relief my ass . Guaranteed the line worker who had both hands crushed and had to sign a release. 2 grand aka 14 hundred ain't going to fix a damn thing including his most important tools. His hands. While fat Tyson executives do cardio. Overwhelming white and overwhelming fat as fuck. Life swap. Life swap. Life swap. Switch the role and put corporations feet to the fire. Lobbyists and government. This is so wrong on so many levels and it is everywhere. So despicable. Again thank you for your reporting on this subject. Love the show. Totally added more bad news to a lot of bad fucking news.
i’ve said it for decades: the most dangerous existential threat to the planet is the corporate legal mandate to “increase shareholder value”.  corporations operate as a computer; this mandate is malicious code which poisons everything they do.  it will lead to the downfall of everything, and yet the power of the corporation also may be the worlds best hope for a sustainable future.  the solution?  it may seem impossible, but rid the corporation of that one legal responsibility.
There is a terrifically depressing game called What Remains of Edith Finch that has a portion where you are a fish processor at a packing plant. It's interesting to play., Trigger warnings though, let me tell you.
The marketing firm that is doing Perdue ads is trying to find that Gieco advert magic.
Come on United States, people losing limbs at the workplace in your country? In which century are you, the 21st or the 19th?
I appreciate the show's logo having changed to dark mode to better reflect the content. Won't take too many more seasons for the set to become dark as well.
Fish factories like the baranof
It doesn't matter because who is voting does mo... ... .. in to the Congress, or allowing political parties voter suppressing. As longnas the corrupted political system isn't changed, as long will America be just a wannabee nation of dreams.
Meatindustry is fucked up world wide - there are the same issues in Europe as well.
"at least 57,000 meat packing workers have contracted the coronavirus. And 283 have died" Darnit John..... SHHHHH!!! That is a case fatality rate of 0.49 percent!! You can't say that publicly. Remember covid is the most dangerous thing to human life!!
The sudden work originally shock because throat globally vanish among a deafening den. nippy, roasted den
Also: OSHA schedules its inspections well in advance. When I worked at the Tyson pork plant in Logansport, there'd be about three weeks out of thr year when the company enforced safety standards - those being the weeks of and leading up to the scheduled inspection. Other than that it was, "fuck your safety; get back to work, peasant."
Load of amusing nonsense to distract the feeble-minded. Wake up! Do not be deceived by "heartwarming" baloney or clever manipulations! The "Federal" Reserve just gifted $2 TRILLION to its banksters buy their uncollectible, mortgage-backed bonds in 2019 to 2020, when they knew that if the banksters attempted to sell such bonds, they would have had to sell them at ludicrously low prices: particularly, because real estate has been in a huge bubble for years and this pandemic has prevented so many businesses from opening, resulted in their insolvency and defaults on their rents and mortgages, and will result in many, many commercial landlords also being in default on their mortgage-backed bonds given to the banksters.  Will anyone give even a fraction of such sums to the poor in Texas or those ordinary Americans who now face huge bills to repair their burst pipes or to buy water to give to their families because the water supply became contaminated? NEVER. There will be federal loans, which the Texas poor and middle class will have to pay for the next decade(s.) They will not get bailouts, because they do not control the USA, like the banksters control it.   (The deceptively named "Federal" Reserve is actually owned by the ultra-rich who own banks that own the shares in the district banks of the "Fed." Those ultra-rich (the "banksters") always cause the "Fed" to pretend to act in the best interests of all Americans, while it actually keeps funneling TRILLIONS in funds to those banksters, who own it and control the US media as reported in Forbes Magazine, which reported that 15 billionaires own US media. See "Audit Of The Federal Reserve Reveals $16 Trillion In Secret Bailouts" in countercurrents d o t o r g.)   With this covid pandemic, I also must point out to all minorities but particularly to African-Americans, that you are being fooled by those in power with nonsense, like the tv shows "American Gods,"  into believing that things are changing. They are not, because those in power just want you to keep voting for them even though they secretly despise you and keep giving them power while you get nothing back, have to attend lousy schools, get inadequate nutrition from companies, like fast food companies that know that their food is hurting you, not qualify for significant sums in student loans, then not be able to get a decent job, and if you got any student loans, have to pay them for the rest of your life, because they are not dischargeable in bankruptcy anymore.  Vote for your own people of your own race, poverty level, ethnic group, and religion, who will actually care about you and act in your own best interests and not for the corrupt "elites" who never represented your interests and got the $2 TRILLION in bailouts these last two years or $29 TRILLION during the last bailouts. See "Bernanke’s Obfuscation Continues: The Fed’s $29 Trillion Bail-Out Of Wall Street" in Huffingtonpost. See "The Fed's $29 TRILLION bailout of Wall Street" in multiplier effects d o t o r g. Take it from a fellow minority member.   However, to all of you poor whites, wake up! You have also been getting the shaft for decades, albeit those who have been wielding it may have sometimes been of your own racial group. Support people who might care about you, because they come from the same position and poverty level and will return to it after they leave office. Not everyone is a crook. The banksters want you to give up, assume everyone is a crook, and just vote for and accept their crooks. Most of the ultra-rich are at war with ordinary Americans, who have not yet noticed.
Buy cheap product, support modern slavery. Interesting to see that this seems to "work" globally, not only in "far, far away land"...
Is Oliver going vegan!!!! :D
Yes yes yes! This goes across every industry with the ‘profit over life’ pandemic.
Well, let´s open a factory in which poultry is processed at safe line speeds, by workers that are distanced enough that being cut by your neighbor cannot happen anymore, with enough breathing room that toilet breaks easily are doable. And then we sell this meat produced by happy workers at supermarkets all over the country at a price that covers all these extra costs just to find out that the customer couldn´t care less if poultry workers live or die and in what circumstances they live if they don´t die.  Sure, we can blame everything on Tyson, the big bad machine, but in fact, Tyson just reacts to our shopping behaviors. If we would buy chicken at three times the price of Tyson chicken because it was bred organically which usually also means processed by a small butcher and not in a factory, Tyson would adapt and offer those products as well. But the fact is, we buy the cheapest chicken we can find, and producing to this clientele simply means producing the Tyson way, it´s not possible to have both.
Just get your meat from the butcher or poulterer. You may pay more, but it's worth it. Usually, not always, better quality meat, animals that are treated better, and less chance people are mistreated like in this video.  If you have the means to change it, please do. Another plus is that you're helping a local business.
I mean I don't understand how the conclusion of all these exposures isn't that Capitalism is a literal dystopia.
Well I know who I will NEVER EVER buy meat from now... vote with your wallets people.
and you wonder why it is that we have so many processed food recalls in this country
Any non union manufacturing plant have conditions similar to this.
Hm, Is "Black" different than "African American" and "Hispanic" different than "Latino"? If so, what's the difference? If not, why would someone write it like that? (at 13:46)
How to become Vegan in 18 minutes
Osceola foods here in Iowa is the same way they don't give a crap about you a guy literally lost his finger and got fired for not showing up the next day
Now : capitalism , brutal like never before  Brought to you by the american dream
9:05 I hope they win a lot of money suing this company.
Bo Pilgrim doing it big
Last Week Tonight: you week isn’t bad enough
yelp time to put the rich bastards on those convayerbelts and eat them instead
The other big issue is they hire anyone.  And not everyone should be given a sharp knife.  Many people at the meat plant I guarded were some of the dumbest, most dangerous people I've met
I work on garbage trucks and feel less likely to get sick than these meat plant workers. By the way, I occasionally have the juice that sits at the bottom of the garbage pile, or ‘leachate’, drip into my mouth. It has a salty flavor.
That is the secons who in a Row that literally screams: Just stop eating meat, you idiots!
Give👏🏻 more👏🏻 than👏🏻 a 👏🏻 fraction👏🏻 of👏🏻 a👏🏻 fuck👏🏻👏🏻
I thank goodness I'm a lifelong vegetarian.
Please do one episode on the farmers protest
I grew up in Waterloo and I have family that works at this plant. I really appreciate this being brought to light on this scale
What happened to you dude
Honestly John keeps proving corporations are allowed to do what they want.  Not saying everyone is bad in big business but when allow someone to do what they want and how they want bad things will happen.
Both my father and sister work at meatpacking plants and they’ve told me a lot of this, but I’m really glad John is talking about it so it can become a national conversation.
Stopped eating meat 2 years ago and a video like this makes me glad I did.
Love this show :DDD Like from Russia :DDDD
Hey John it would be great if you cover Indian Farmer Protest in one of your episode.
Fairly certain almost no American especially in the city has anything but racist contempt for people who can kill their own food, so I dont really need to be spoken down to about an industry everyone knows is like this because nobody will change. Also, youre a partisan shill and shouldve stayed in your broken failing country.
All these comments and upvotes, not one mention of stopping the barbaric and needless suffering of animals. You people keep talking about whats "depressing" yet won't even bother to change the behaviors you engage in such as paying for animal torture and murder. THATS depressing.
With Tyson, America is literally like a 3rd world country.
John Oliver be making me want to be a politician..  but who tf actually WANTS to be a politician?? FML :'(
5:53 No kinkshaming! Lmao
algorithm comment
Didn’t we have a huge book about this put out in 1887 or something?
Imagine living in the U.S.
Working in a corporate office is very different (esp. perks) than other locations, for any company. But this video is disgusting. Thanks for shining some light on the current pandemic issues.
Money bro that’s all this these companies want.
"greater oversight is needed" No, these barbaric industries need to be fucking abolished. Period.
how can you talk about Texas and not mention AOC and Beto O`Raurke
From a General prospective this sound like "Human Enslavement"...only it's based on greed......greedy greed!
Damn this was a depressing episode
If this happened in China America would be so concerned for the wellbeing of the workers... lol its so hypocritical
Big issue when you don't/can't have quality federal regulation.   if it's at the state level then corporations game the system and threaten to move to a different state.  If it's federal they can threaten to move out of country, but then you have issues when your packaging says made overseas or in central America consumers likely will be focusing on the made in US or at least Canada options,they could is move to Canada, but Canada has stricter health/safety laws then basically any US state so the companies won't gain in those area's. Secondary issue of course is US politicians being corrupt as F___, considering that guy felt he could do a straight up bribe in public means it likely has worked before but he tried to bribe the wrong guy.   On the other hand there was seemingly no meaningful consequence for trying to bribe a politician in public.
Was the US ever good at anything? Or was it just that dream you all had?
I don’t understand how on earth is it possible for those waivers to be considered legal?
Purdue in Sussex county Delaware will straight up call INS on employees that fail to meet quotas or complain about the conditions at the plant. It’s modern slavery.
Say the word, Mr. Oliver!!! We'll go onto their website to complain and crash their system! It's happened before!
no one's gonna be sad if their local grocery store is out of tyson anytizers or hormone pumped chickens... so there's no reason these companies can't slow down production and protect their workers.
Why the fuck is anybody eating meat from this industry?  Humans and animals are treated like shit... FFS

Factory Farming is horrid.  But Meat is great for you.
time for a heavy unionisation offensive mass strikes and a destruction of the idea of capitalism   but i say that basically every week and quite frankly i don't understand why this does happen more often for people
No one wants to inspect dead animals  #govegan
Looks like Texas is really thriving to be a "3rd world" state.
Whenever an American chants "America number one" that's what I see in my head. And then I laugh my ass off.
Video making me want to go vegan again. Ignorance is not bliss, it's part of the problem. Thanks John
How do US companies compete with china? by using the same strategies. Pay workers low wages, ignore health standards and do everything to maximize profits
Iowa as a whole did not take corona virus seriously
Lastly, in the regards of inspectors from Osha and the like, the workplaces generally know when these inspections are going to occur.  During times like this I have seen many a work place temporarily fix a problem they have known about for months just so it will pass inspection.  Hell one place I used to work for made us come in for overtime to clean and paint the entire facility just because they knew inspectors were coming the following week.  It is hard to get a clear picture of what might truly be going on in a workplace when the cards are stacked in favor of the workplace.
11:13. I guess a more fitting name would be ‘Cuckingham Palace’.
I'm a meat cutter at a NH food coop, the problem isn't these companies it's the fact that the only way to meet all the federal and USDA regulations is to have a massive factory farm. My neighbor raises beautiful grass fed steer on a "hobby farm", he's only got 18-24 head of cattle. It would cost him more than the price of the cow to have it shipped to a USDA approved  slaughterhouse/packing plant. If he paid me to process his animal, vacuum pack and freeze it for retail sale he'd go to jail for longer than any white collar criminal for embezzling millions. If he asked me to volunteer to process his cow, vacuum pack it and give it to friends and neighbors for free that it's ok. I already know that people will call me a crazy libertarian but I think food and what you consume being controlled by the government is horrifying.
I hate ads with screaming children, my gas station started playing ads while you pump gas, I thought annoying but whatever 😒 they played one with screaming children, finally straw to make me go get a Costco card and get gas there
Judi Dench went a little down the list since "Cats" and "Artemis Fowl"...
I like how every episode Oliver reports on all these problems without mentioning the root cause. Greed aka Capitalism.
My city just rejected Tyson from having a chicken barn here.  Nobody here wanted that shit at all.
You know the bad perception "we" have about living/working in countries like China? The USA do not seem that different for a good chunk of the population.
I used to work at a chemical factory.. with some products they made mosterd gass was created as byproduct.  Really dangerous stuff.. when inasked why the protective gear( extraction pipes) was held together by stickers and why the last yearly control was over 10 years ago i was let go.. because it was clear i didnt like the job according to them..  Till this day i am amazed how many things there where so f ed up beyond what you would expect when looking at health and safety codes.
One of the many reasons I am vegan. 🥑
Don't know why everyone is so mad. Tyson was only following the 211th rule of acquisition.  "Employees are the rungs on the ladder of success. Don't hesitate to step on them."
Capitalism=Money > Humans.
I mean, of course this happens, when you run a country on a platform of "Business Regulations bad", what else would you expect? This, the mess that is Infrastructure (especially in Texas right now) or remember that Oil Rig years ago? That one was "controlled" by an understaffed and overworked government Agency too.
usa is f***** up
OK Foods in Arkansas is similarly fucking despicable with how it treats its workers.
Will a holy handgrenade work against the guinea pig?
so, if corporations are people, when people kills a people, a fine isnt the typical recourse...
I love sadness
I work in meatpacking in Finland and let me tell you, it's different here.
Meat is murder!
I wish John Oliver would do an episode on how Disney treats it's employees, considering how badly Gina Carano was treated.
John, maybe you should stop.. They themselves call it the greatest county on earth, but they are clearly the stupidest people on this planet..
I recently read “Slaughterhouse: The Shocking Story Of Greed, Neglect And Inhumane Treatment Inside The U.S. Meat Industry”, written by Gail Eisnitz. Which is a graphic and more elaborated version of this story. It’s abhorrent but a must read if you want to know what’s really going on in those plants. Thanks John Oliver for shining a light!
I like how every episode Oliver reports on all these problems without mentioning the root cause. Greed aka Capitalism.
Damn, we gotta get Universal Basic Income fast!
Yay not a trump or covid story!
Namaste in this state of denial
he sounds so angry in this one.
Another day, another industry with effective monopoly's that abuse workers then pay the "fine" aka braking the law license fee and continues. I wonder if there is perhaps a deeper underlying issue here.... hm... perhaps its something about money and politics.
We also need to stop eating meat morning noon and night. The meat companies want us to think that cheap meat is normal, but it is not. The animals are exploited, the farmers are exploited, meat workers and supermarket staff. All this for us to eat too much animal products and get heart disease, diabetes and cancer... And probably the next pandemic.
John Oliver is back, and he is hitting hard.
if people think america doesn't still have slavery, just take those people to a meat packing plant
12 minutes in and still no jokes about Mr. Oliver voicing a bird, or being told he resembles a bird. Well done, writers for not punching down or settling for easy jokes.
We need decentralized meat packing plants and scale down the size to local providers only.  Funny, I was thinking it’s all not worth living for...this place is a disaster just like my body. May I go home now.
And what are they hurrying their employees for, so the chicken or pork or whatever can sit on a shelf for a couple days? The grocery stores are packed with food, and McDonalds can’t sell enough food that they are making it even cheaper so you can buy more. The rich people are a disgrace to our country.
The speed of production is generally pretty ridiculous in any factory that I've ever worked in.  For example, my current employer expects my line to turn out almost 90 parts in one hour.  That means that most stations on that line have seconds to complete their work and move onto the next part.  I'm not saying my job is really all that comparable to theirs but repeated stress injuries and other types of injuries are quite common due to how we work.  Also, with lack of replacement workers for people on the line and the speed of the line it is not surprising that many workers feel stuck when they need to go to the bathroom.  It is annoying having to hunt down your supervisor so you can go with the knowledge that you might come back to a mess due to no one replacing you or someone inexperienced.
Fun fact, it's the same in a lot of other countries. Germany for example...
That is not a fine, that is a legalized bribe.  Are we getting back to the times when Upton Sinclair wrote "The Jungle" ?
what an "amazing" productivity
Did he get botox ew
What's keeping me here?
I have to say.. maybe the guy that was pissing in the pork plant just liked to do that, until we have asked him and found out the facts lets not judge yet, he might just be a serial pisser. lol. I joke
the greatest shithole in the world! god bless murica!
No company is like a family.
It's like Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle".
Havent we talked about this before? With comments about guitar music or something?
God this is infinitely less depressing than the one about future pandemics
You can thank Trump for the 283 meatpackers who died, and the thousands who got sick with the virus.  At the request of the meat packing industry (whom I'm sure also richly rewarded him with hefty campaign donations), Trump issued an order forcing meat packers afraid of getting the virus back to work as "essential workers", or they would lose any unemployment benefits they might be qualified for.  I'm serious.  Trump and the GOP passed an order FORCING meat packers back to work, or starve with no safety net.  The meat packers were extorted into returning to work, where they sickened and died.  Why and how Trump and the GOP got away with that without national outrage, is both a mystery and a disgrace.  Trump should be prosecuted criminally for murder for the lives he cost doing that, along with the ghoulish owners of the meatpacking plants who bribed (I'm sorry, requested) him to do that....
Where can I join this gambling pool
every time a company would tell you they treat their employees like family. It's always a shady business.
What's ironic I watched a few slaughter house videos right before I said let me go see what John was talking about.
Once again, John Oliver makes me thankful to live in Europe.
I used to watch this religiously now it’s just a constant bitchfest. This show was supposed to be funny
Businesses has no place in politic. Lobbying culture in america will be its downfall.
It is hard competing with slave labor in China. Should have never opened American companies up to trade with China like it was banned to do with Soviet Russia.
That perdue commercial was... interesting.  I still don’t believe that was actually aired.
Please make a video about the new farm laws in India, the protests against them and the government's way of handling the situation. The world needs to know what's going on over here.
Hey look Johnny boy is back for two episodes and now I’m considering going vegetarian
As Usual,  'Muricas leagal bribes, or "Lobbying" is the root of this problem.  Goverment is for the people, not for those that can afford to change the laws with their fortune.
what a sh hole country.. hello from denmark
This is besides the point, but can we talk about why a funeral costs over $15000?! Like holy shit, burying a corpse in a box somehow takes several months of salary?
I just applied to tyson, im glad i saw this before i made a mistake
Was I alone in  expecting John to roast Ted Cruz  for bolting to Cancun during the Texas winter storm?
Once again proving, corporations don't give a shit about their workers, as long as they turn a profit. Just another example of why unions should be more wide spread, and one more reason to eat less meat.
So Texas basically let's corporations do anything to their workers. Is this why companies are leaving California and moving to Texas? That's just fucked up
I can't speak for other plants, but I work in a meatpacking plant and I haven't seen any of the stuff he complains about. It's family owned, very small, and understaffed to hell. The job sucks but it's not a dystopian nightmare like he describes
This actually makes me want to become a vegetarian :/  And as someone who worked in a college research lab, the fact that people can get away with OSHA violations so flippantly is kind of mind boggling. But I guess if you have enough money to make policy, then you can get away with literal murder.
if this isnt a sweat shop, i don't know what is. :/
There is also a simple solution that doesn't need to wait for the government to do something. Just stop supporting the companies by buying their meat. Eat more veggies and You will be much better off.
every company that says their employees are FAMILY... 9 times out of 10, they couldn't give less of a shit about their employees and that is why they feel the need to advertise the "family" lie.
Aren't these OSHA fines "per day"?
Eh my order of operations are  1. Liquids for hydration 2. My phone 3. My playstation 5 4. Food, cause I've still got 50+ pounds to lose and doing keto I can fast if I have to and your hunger goes away after a few days, so I could legitimately do a long term fast if I had to. 5. My wife who I wish was more important but like she needs to get her ish together. I shouldn't have to work and also do 80% of the household stuff. 6. My cats. 7. My dog. Stop pissing on the carpet every time I go to sleep and can't take you out when I'm asleep, and biting me when I pick you off the bed so that you'll go outside and piss out there, and I won't rate you lower than the cats!  Family is like at 20-40 range. My family is not great... Her family is in the 100s. Trash people. Abusive people which is why she's got so many mental psychosis and problems.  My wife's number 1 is probably cigarettes. 2 is probably food.
pilgrim looks like chicken breast voldemort
Has John been looking more gray that before?
Upton Sinclair wrote about it in 1905. Will you ever get to the bottom of this in the U.S.....?
Now we understand why trump used the defense production act to keep the meatpacking plants open and not manufacturer tests or vaccine.
Inhumane working conditions, disgusting treatment of animal life, antibiotic resistance, environmental impact. There is not a single reason to continue eating meat like we do right now other than "tastes good for a moment". Everyone knows it. Most people actually think "something should change". But no one changes. Even though we have all the power to change it.
Ah the propaganda against meat packing has begun. Time to buy amd hold artificial meat company shares
²"not work related": Two of the three main spreading events in Germany started at Meatpacking facilities .... YES, it IS work related.
I miss the USA having Trump as president. LWT used to be funnier.
we know how this ends... Sonmi will lead the revolution to end the meatpacking ethical massacre leading to nuclear war.
Based on the title I'm not sure if it is wise to eat my breakfast while watching this, but I'm gonna take my risks.
Its officially the dark ages
... all this bs makes ya wish we were back in the good old days of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle... back when a pro-Socialist piece of literature was received as a whistleblowing exposé of a terrible and gross industry... Huh. Guess America IS Great Again. #GAGA #1905 #2021 #VoteForZombieTeddyRooseveltForPresident
Lmao.....  I live here in this world.....  I have friends and family here Oliver......  But yeah.... Spit that truth!  💜💜💜
Its kind of funny to see how lowering standards in USA in rising standards in China are meeting halfway. I expect china to shift production to cheap slave workers in US at some point
This is America... after watching this tv since the very beginning and not even suprise by this.
I hope Dame Judi watched this.
Fast Food Nation was first published in 2001 and John Oliver talked about it 20 years later. Clearly, nothing changes.
'Murica! The 3'rd world country dressed up as a first word country.
Havent you Americans had enough already ? What more do you want to happen in order for you to give up the addiction to the "free market" before you/your loved ones die? The only way to change the murderous practices of capitalists is to nationalise the plants,and give workers proper rights.  And if you think "I m not a worker,I am one of those corporate office employees ,so i dont care ,i am safe",wait till the rich decide that your well beeing is not important because they have AI to replace you. You stand up for the rights of others today, in order to protect your own rights in the future.  Organise,strike,and finally topple this capitalist system that kills you slowly every day,but you are so in love with ... Otherwise the 1% rich subhuman perverts will never stop.
Number 1: phone
Go vegan 🌱
My mom works at a Chicken Plant & says that managers don’t want essential workers to Quarantine because they need them, & they’re LITERALLY Let them walk around with COVID !!
hes jokes are so boring, its even worse without the laughing hahahaha...
And yet people are so focused on the racial issues instead of how utterly corrupt our government is. The system keeps us at each other's throats so they can keep getting away with things like this.
This is how a nation should treat their workers who keep them fed.
now imagine what the animals are going through ...      go vegan
Jon and everyone involved this show are absolutely aware of the animal rights issues happening because of the meat industry. I still wish he would dedicate an entire episode about it rather than just mentioning it.
When we speak of appalling conditions in the meat packing industry, it has always included the employee working conditions . For example, ever seen ‘Fast Food Nation?’ This is nothing new. People, reconsider your dietary choices.
John Oliver - the only comedian you watch with this expression: 😬😬😬
Ahh yes perfect time to upload        ONE IN THE MORNING
7:45  Ironic then that Claxton Chicken in Georgia is located on the same highway where there is a prison and prisoner three transfer facilities...
JBS is also a major company involved in the greatest case of corruption involving countries of latin america, the biggest was in Brasil, where the 2 brothers that owns the company was sentenced to jail time.
Hey john? Can u talk about the recent and constant threat of a dictatorship brazilian politics are blatantly speaking of right now? Im scared this wont get enough worldwide attention and theyll use this to actually start one
It's honestly amazing how corporations and media managed to convince a lot of americans that unions are bad. Because let's be honest here, in any other western country if workers were treated like this there would be a massive strike. That being said it wouldn't probably happen considering that most things allowed in the US are extremely illegal in Europe.
Why does anyone listen to this tea sucking weasel
That Purdue commercial is great.
What do you expect from a place where animals are killed.
Land of the free... if you are a big corporation.
in other words, "why unions are important". Not to say legislation doesn't also need to happen, but those workers could have so much bargaining power themselves were they to unionize.
Bring on automation then.
Wow the USA looks quiet fucked... makes me happy i live in europe where our "Goverment" makes sure companies cannot borderline kill me
Yeah whose the inventor
im not a vegan but this is half of the reason why factory farming should be re-established to not submit to self destruction #1 country in the world........we are number 1 at being fucking stupid and fucked up......we are the world's circus...i am an american...this channel is more educational than the school system
Yep but John, you do know that you live in a mansion too right. With your multi million salary. While many of us live in a trailer and have never and will never see anywhere close to one million dollars. You don't care about us. None of you talking heads or government officials care about us
People wonder why I hate humanity. This is it.
UNIONIZE..
If I ever visit my US friends again, I'm going vegan. This is so criminal
Did bill gates fund this so people will eat bio meat?
John Oliver’s solutions are all government intervention. And when you start putting limits on the economy by government intervention things will stagnate. Most of the time companies do all of these things to increase profit and productivity to COMPETE with other companies. If you start putting caps on how much or how to compete there will be big problems as well.
When I heard the words valued and family to describe how they treat their workers, I knew they treated them like shit.  Those are the catch words for every company that doesn't give two fucks about their workers.
Nobody can convince me that first world countries need that much meat to survive and yet...
Any company that claims that they are a "family" are the worst.
The real issue is on our side, the fact that we are always looking for the cheapest price for our meat instead of paying the just price.
Yes this is the USA be proud? I wonder how many employees become vegetarians? Oh right they don’t make enough money to buy enough healthy veggies to survive.
Bruh they talked about my hometown and for exactly the reasons I expected. Way to go Waterloo.
Capitalism is great!
good old capitalism working as intended 👍
The good(?) news is in a few decades all these workers will lose their jobs to automation anyway!
The joys of laboring under unfettered capitalism. Can anyone tell me when deregulation was actually good for the consumer or workforce? Because that's what Republican's corporate donors tell them to say.
Well done John, pointing out, yet again the US is the most hypocritical country in the world. The US has so many human rights abuses, but of course, America is the best country in the world. Assholes!
Businesses are small-scale tyrannies. Speaking up or failing to please the dictator gets you executed, eh fired.
How is all this even legal. The US really is a third world country.
Watched on HBO, came here to upvote too
I really love that John Oliver didn't get as discussed about the action (peeing under the production line), as much as the reason why the employee did it. It's important to look at why something happend, rather that what happend.
Why TF is it available on YouTube before HBO Max? Wtfo?
This is so disgusting. We deserve to be wiped off this planet.
isn't all this literally capitalism working as intended?
What happened before john says “moving on”
Meat industry is evil to the core, why should you be surprised how they treat their employees when you see how they treat their produce.
The reason I stopped eating meat the second time was because I do not trust the United States meet industry. There is no one checking up on the meat to make sure another mad cow disease situation doesn't happen. They don't check every plant and only go at random times to random plants because they don't have the money or the funds to do the work that's necessary. They have completely unsanitary and inhumane practices.
"Meat is controlled by these 4 companies" "Poultry is controlled by these 4"  *both show Tyson* UMMMM....
Come on he did put his gloves back on 🤣😅😅😝
I wish John Oliver would also mention striking and worker owned coops as alternative strategies as well. Stuff that can acted on immediately.
Your TV Show Host is lying. Start supporting Unions and dont rely on state officals anymore.
Slave owners have changed their business model not their hearts, their employees (slaves) are the underpaid downtrodden force that works for them. The slavers ask their rich buddies to ignore their horrible practices so both can profit from misery. Fine them out of business.
Who the Duck is shocked working in a meat packing plant is terrible?
A 15 minute piece on nicotine vaping, its proven safety, efficacy and lies told to everyone against it could really do some good and be a hell of a story. If HBO and JO put on their critical thinking caps they will see what an absolute crock of s*** all of this anti-vaping rhetoric is and what a technological miracle vaping actually is. Its definitely a story befitting of LWT and _just_ affects 480k Americans (no one cares about) who die every year from tobacco related disease.
Oh, no... those poor, poor corpse desecrators...”
Libertarians will see this and be like “this would be better with less government regulation.”
Why would immigrants be wary of reporting their employers? Are you talking about illegal immigrants? Legal immigrants shouldn't have anything to worry about.
You can see workers are treated like shit when they use the "family" card
Wouldn't it be nice to have a political party that cared enough about its citizens to have a research team like John Oliver has, and then an actual Agency to work on issue resolutions???
Strangely, I got another conclusion after watching this segment : "this is capitalism".
0:23 when you tought it an ads about rabies prevention.
"If you ate meat tonight, it went through one of  them"... 😮 poor choice of words..!!
John : "world is shit, here how we can fix it", rest of the world : "yeah sure but no"
At the rate of financial punishment per death that JBS received from OSHA(2500 per person), you could negligently kill the entire United States population for a comparatively paltry $900 billion. JBS could aquire that much money in just 18 years
I hope everyone got their rabies vaccine.
Goddamnit John, now I have to bust out my copy of The Jungle.... AGAIN.  Thanks for that.  It's about as reader-friendly as insurance company boilerplate, but it's just as relevant now as it was 100 years ago.
GO PACKERS!
13:44 the lack of critical thinking here is astounding.
Honestly most of that work could easily be automated... But it's cheaper to underpay people to do it. Think about that. That's how much your time and wellbeing is worth to these companies.
Boycott the meat industry, it's a horrific industry built on literal death, exploitation, that also breeds pandemics, destroys it's consumers health and destroys the planet. They're is no good justification to support the eat meat industry ever.
This is the reason why liars like Trump become presidents or congressmen. Laws and anything that protects workers are under interests of big companies. And all of these happened under democrat's watch.
The voice in my head now has a British accent. I've officially watched too much of this show
Ah yes, the weekly episode about how fucked up the US is.
"(USA) the best economy in the world" (i am quoting some comments i've read)  Are you kidding me? There are countries with way higher GDP per capita AND lower inequality than USA. I know you guys are still dreaming (or are delusional) about the good old days, but lets be real: your country has not the best economy in the world and is definitely not one of the best ones to live. I mean, It is a relatively good country, of course; and has a great economy too; but the best? I don't think so.
People are compelled by economic pressures to stay in oppressive jobs largely because we do not share natural wealth equally.  IF we charge fees to industries that pollute or deplete natural resources or destroy wildlife habitat, they'll have an incentive to reduce harmful impacts. That will promote sustainability. If we share the fee proceeds equally to all people, no one would live in poverty. No one would face the threat of becoming destitute for leaving or declining a job that they feel is too dangerous or does not pay enough.  How to fix civilization: https://gaiabrain.blogspot.com/2015/12/how-to-fix-civilization.html
the Ad was bizarre af
This is Republicans' fault, and these idiots still think they're the party of the working class.  Yeah, get rid of the regulations, what are they for anyway?  Let the market work it out.  Morons.
Just go vegan.
Management placing bets on covid isn't too crazy... It's not like they could close down the plant. Corporations don't give a single shit about employees. The only thing that matters in America is profit.
Honestly, this is a better reason not to eat meat than any vegetarian has ever told me.   Still probably going to eat meat though.  Sorry, Bacon is way too delicious to give up.
John, please cover Indian Farmers Protests in your program. It would make a world of difference if you do.
This country can be fucked up but it’s still the best. Those homeless and the issues in this country isn’t fixed by blaming other people. It’s about understanding the value in personal decisions and the important of the family unit. You notice a lot of people who have both parents still together and complete high school don’t work a lot of these shitty jobs. I don’t have a perfect solution to fix all of the issues in America, but I know blaming others and blaming rich people or poor people. But the one thing that seem to have gone out the window in this day and age is the consequences of personal choices. If you make the choice then you must live with the consequences. And the workers comp stuff is only being shown from the employees side. What about the employer? You don’t think there are people trying to game the system? My point is for as bad as one side looks the other probably looks just as bad. And his racial statistics is the same racebaiting that needs to stop in this country.
Aaaaaand another bullet point added to the list of reasons to stop fucking eating meat.
Even though Last Week Tonight likely reached out to Tyson for comments before publishing the story, by morning they will have released a statement saying that "they were misrepresented by John Oliver" and that they "vehemently opposed the accusations being made". And by the days end of the day, Tyson will have likely filed a slapp suit against HBO for defamation. Our legal system is a joke.
😑ppl have really difficult jobs..
An industry treating animals abhorently also treats people abhorently. What a shocker
This show really portrays how barbarian the US still is.
Jokes on you. We asians are the master of commercials that are unrelated to its product
Ahhh feels good to be a vegan!
What? An industry that's based on torture and exploitation lacks empathy for its employees? Shocking!!!
Glad to see you going back to Pre-Trump, when he was funny.
You becoming an American was one of the greatest things to happen to US!
When will you talk about the bad infasturacture and no water in texas john oliver?
PLAGARISM I SAY! Upton Sinclair already became famous for reporting on this in 1906. You can't claim the entire spectrum of sadness for yourself John. That's greedy.
You could show video evidence of actual children being worked to death in these packaging plants and people like Ben Shapiro or Trump Jr would still say any regulation is basically Stalinist communism
That industry is just as disgusting and exploitative over here in Germany. It made me stop eating meat and dairy products. Man, feels good to have that moral dilemma out of my mind
who cares if they made that bet?    they're family
god this is disgusting... how can you have such situations in the US and pretend to be a developped country...
I miss when he was a correspondent for colbert. They both "used" to be hilarious
I always gag when I hear a company talk about "we are like a family"
At this point you gotta wonder, what ISN'T wrong in the US and big companies
ALL the global pandemics came for animals you eat. Keep it up,  and the viruses will mutate and wipe you out.
When I see reports like this, it just makes me glad I live in the EU.
Honestly, all of these issues could just be fixed by proper unemployment social security. Make it less terrible for people to quit a job, and suddenly employers actually have to give a fuck. Stop focusing on symptoms, solve underlying issues.
And here come all the vegans....
bUT theY CAN juSt qUit And wOrk soMEWHeRE eLsE  - Every conservative / Republican.
*READ MY NAME*   STOP WATCHING THIS TRASH.
Watched on HBO, just here to give a like.
Ahem..UNIONS!!!!!!!!!!
If a company made money after a fine then its not a fine its just another license cost the company plans for. Hurt profits or its irrelevant.
i love how john oliver is totally ignoring trump
Please talk about corruption in Nigeria
These things were described by Marx and Engels more than 150(!!) years ago.. how is it possible, that this BS is still going on?? By now it should be obvious that capitalism literally kills people!
Tönnies: The country with the most new covid cases in europe at one point, while only being one company
What I find hilarious is people like Bo are republicans, religious republicans, who DARE imply the left has no morals? and morality is owned by the right. You gotta be shitting me. This guy is guaranteed a first class ticket to hell.
My brother used to work at a Tyson packing plant. He hated it and I heard so many horror stories. This is horrifying.
Non-American here but maybe the Americans at home should discontinue buying products of Tyson, Purdue, Pilgrims, etc. until there are tangible revisions. Most Americans are well-off so maybe you can consider other options or maybe even plant based meat substitute.
Literally Hassan Made the same episode more then half a year ago....
Another thing to add to my list of reasons that I’m a vegetarian.  Man, this country is really going in a bad direction! Corporate lobbyists essentially bribing lawmakers to act in their favor, while nobody lobbies for citizens, our rights are being chipped away everyday, and we have no way to fight against it.  As a country, we should value the well-being of our people, ALL people! Bc a country cannot be the best in the world when it allows so many to fall thru the cracks, when it doesn’t ensure basic safety standards in the workplace, when the middle class is sliding towards poverty level.  We can’t just continue to say we’re the best, when we are falling behind in so many ways: our school system has always paled in comparison to many countries, and it continues to decline, our workers enjoy less benefits and less protections than many others, the wealth gap continues to to get wider, the justice system gets less just for most of us, while ‘white collar’ crime (which often has devastating effects on large amounts of people) barely gets appropriate punishment. Too bad so many of our leaders put their greed and lust for power above all else!
The sad of this is....these companies work their workers to death to put out numbers just for the products to get thrown in dumpsters which then have to get guarded by police.
The classic "we are family" troupe lol if you hear this run out of the interview
This is so fucked-up. Please don't think the way this country works cannot be changed.
I always love when someone tries to get sanctimonious about how I rarely get a break as a bartender. Like, I know they're trying to be sweet, but at the same time, it's a very "Oh my sweet summer child" moment.
could be solved by unionizing
The Holy Hand-Grenade was needed in this opening add.
I just saw Fast Food Nation
Wow, an episode that has nothing to do with Trump. I didn't think these were going to exist for a few more years.
Time to get unionized, Ill burn them to the ground.
Hmm. Well done America. Another reason why the rest of the world laughs at you.  Dont get me wrong. We arent laughing at those whom have to live through your tyranny. We laugh at your continued attempts at trying to act like you're a just country filled with opportunity for those whom are willing to work for it.
#meateww
im a fucking college student and i could pay those fines without breaking a sweat wtf
Sadly the situation is very similar in germany. Tons of outbreaks were related to meat packing facilities, where low wage workers from Poland etc not only worked tightly packed at the lines but were also shoved into small apartments together
Hey Germany here. We already gone through this half a year ago, and we don't care much about it.  Good luck over there!  Edit: ok we are not that bad, we still have worker rights. (Walmart can cry about this, they failed here because if the law, because they can't exploit here that easy.)
But John you forgot that line needs to go up.
Capitalism  will seek out slavery or get as close to it as it can.
As much as I enjoy the humor on this show, it's difficult for me to make it through most episodes without thinking "wow, somebody should really be lined up against a wall and shot for this."
Hell ! They were refraining themselves those previous season or is it the world that's revealling itself increasingly darker under the lamp of covid... Don't mind answering I did it myself.
There's _another_ reason to lessen meat consumption.
I just wish he also said something about maybe, hmmm... EATING LESS MEAT?! :D
Uh meatpacking unionization uh just a wish or a huge cut to ceo and upper management. Make them get paid the same as starting workers. cause fuk um
This doesn’t even begin to scratch  the surface. Look into how they treat their farmers, predatory contracts, driving them into debt, the bullshit just goes on and on.  The real tragedy is all of these issues was raised almost a decade ago and absolutely nothing was done to avoid it.
Companies influencing politics in order to exploit their employees even more?!  I don´t get it! Thats more american than burgers, the simpsons or bombing countries that have oil. When i think of americans, i think of corporate slaves, and a few slave masters. Its not even a race-thing anymore.   I always laugh when i hear the "Best country in the world"-phrase... at least the slaves are well trained, and don´t know how actual freedom looks like.
https://youtu.be/VoAfb3f04mo
You know what else you could do about this? Don‘t fucking buy meat! There are so many issues like this one in this industry for the animals, the workers and the environment. This should be talked about a whole lot more frequently! Btw, the dairy industry is not better either.
Germany basically had the same scandal with the company "Tönnies". Spread the word
I dont fail to notice, you are showing "MEATPACKING" rather than.. MEAT PACKERS. You are helping the "anti meat" future for Bill Gates and his Farm Control and anti meat bs climate/covid forever vaccine reality.  Bug meat for all.. except those elites hm? I dont say the packers dont suffer, but lets get it real FAST here, ALL working class suffer. Wow.. who would have guessed. Companies dont value workers!?
You forgot to mention our dumbass governor, Kim Reynolds
And that’s why we only eat hala meat
#AFunMachineLikeAdamDriver
This is why people start looking towards a communist way of government!!!
Didn't Donald Trump sign something at the end of his term saying that the lines at these chicken meat packing companies can actually go faster processing the chickens.  yeah sounds like something he would do.
Man
you guys??? hello?? where are the strikes??? where are the unions???? This is not a new issue you guys!!!! where the fuck is the law and why is lobbying legal
नमस्ते
All these big name companies care about is making money and not giving a shit about those doing all the hard work for them while paying them scraps and having them suffer from injuries, death or diseases.
This is not US exclusive. Here in Germany it is just the same. Modern slavery in every aspect. Lowest wages, corona scandals. And the animals are treated as bad as the workforce.
After 2020  I'm no longer surprised.
I choose to believe the betting pool was a supervisor trying to say in an informal way that they should be more concerned about Corona prevention. In which case it worked.
Put them in prison, death row, next to the bankers who launder the drug money.
...what a shit hole country...
An end to the pork industry- we don’t need to be eating pigs
Line speeds are insane, not only at meat packing plants.
I have 2 jobs in a third world country, and combined they don't suck as bad as that shit
I think its time to just throw the whole planet away
I only get my meat from my local butcher, who has farms together with other butchers. I've been to visit them. he grows all his own feed and all the animals have outside and inside areas. It's quality stuff and you really taste that.
you think covid might be like the black plague 2? like, will enough of the working class die that they start becoming valuable again? probably not.
To be fair, I also took/made bets on how many of my dumbass family members would get Covid.
The world is so bad.
Uh.. Goddamnit. I really don't know if I want to watch this. *Continues to hit play*
But if we start caring about meat packing workers, I might have to pay more than $0.89 a pound for chicken and I'm not sure I'm ready for that.
🤤
And another problem would be solved by becoming vegan.
That's why we need strong workers' unions.
I remember 5 years ago when this was the funniest man on the planet. This sucks more for us than him, but it must be hard to be John Oliver.
Its actually inasne that people will be so close to poverty/famine that the only jobthey´re able to take is becoming endentured servants to a multi billion dollar corporation and getting seriously injured or contracting a deadly virus and then fired for it, while the spokesperson for the company has the gaul to claim they treat their workers like family. This is the "free market" run wild. How are workers rights and protections not a main talking point in the US. Oh wait... I remember.
Another episode of a "developed" third world country.
Am I surprised about the difference between how the employees behind on the line and the employees behind the desks look?  No.
And that's why richest billionaire turds are in USA, but standard of living is way better in West European Countries.
These people need a union
Mr. Oliver, if this bothers you please look into Resers in Topeka, Kansas. They are horrible. They do forced overtime, high drug use by workers, lots of injuries (while booking appointments without letting the worker know so they would miss many appointments and then get kicked off workman's comp. for non-compliance), sexual harassment, but the worse part is the multiple listeria outbreaks and skipping daily cleaning schedules . They also do mass layoffs. There are so many stories that we could tell. Enough that I worry about being sued just so I can tell our experiences! Keep the pressure up on these assholes. It's about time that someone came out fighting against these greedy, self absorbed dicks. We are thrilled that it is you! Thank you!
... Finally no Trump! I looked forward for this day. Feels like back to normal.
This is where I start believing the man who’s opinion I found somewhat interesting. The Republican Party has become the confederacy party. They used to own slaves now the poor, immigrants, and middle class have become slaves to the rich. The rich always need to control others and manipulate situations to strip all human comforts from their workers. Republican states are so cruel to employees. No benefits, no vacation/sick leave (or if they offer 2 weeks which is shared as both until used up.) keep us as simply cheap labor. No unions. Budget cuts to inspectors is part of their game plan. They care about money not people. It’s always been a Republican point.
Sounds like working at Amazon, where they said "if any coworker in close quarters to you personally gets covid we will get in tough with you to have you tested" Then everyone around you gets covid and not even a wellness call from HR
The solution is pretty simple, unions. If you want to balance the power dynamic between companies and workers you need to give workers enough power to be able to bargain with the company. Europe has done this for decades and everything works fine, so it's not even some radical new idea, it's tried and true.
I guess it's also taxing psychologically to tear apart living things the whole day
Should have said something about how factory farming gives rise to new , unknown, infectious diseases. And I am sure it's even worse abroad. Time to look for meat alternatives  and some of them are quite good. Let's not go the way of the dinosaurs.
I really appreciate the ad with the possessed guinea pig.
thank you for covering this. two of the largest outbreaks in Alberta happened at meat packing plants.
I worked at Fieldale chicken packing plant when I was a teen. One day a truck dropped a load of breasts and thighs outside the plant on the asphalt. They had us grab a bunch of shovels and scoop them into a rusty dumpster. I made a joke saying " watch me get a load of breast and thighs on the line with gravel in it". Later I got a load of breasts and thighs and the last tub I opened up was nothing but gravel and dirt. My manager came over and actually stuck his hand in the tub and tried to scrape through it and said "is there anything good under there". I said "what the fuck does it look like". The relieved me for 20 minutes and had managers surround my pallet so no one could get close to it. The next day I was fired. I repeat.....I WAS FIRED. WTF. Fuck the meat packing industry. John, everything you said about illegal immigrants and injuries is absolutely true. I'm so glad you've done an episode on this. The last bastion of true journalism.
those jobs make amazon warehouses look like heaven  edit: actually, all warehouse jobs are just shit. governments need to ban them all or regulate them better
Jesus fucking Christ, every time I watch this show I'm just dumbfounded by the unseen evils apparently ubiquitous in America. It's like we can't open a door in this country without finding some fucked up evil thing going on behind it. How do we unfuck this fucked nation?
What a business can not pay for worker's compensation. I don't think that's a good idea.
So instead of maybe slowing down processing time so people can pee out of the production floor without the risk of contamination, meatpacking facilities will just fire workers? And people's reaction is all "My food!" instead of the above?  Fucking brilliant, guys.
John: If you've eaten mwat today.... Me: No John, I'm  actually a vegetari- *looks down at chicken taquitos* Fuck
Tell me again why ppl want  to come to this country????
When you are making a video on farmers protests..   It will be good if u do that!
The meat industry is pure evil. I've worked at a site for 3 months. It was  like a nazi concentration camp. Supervisors scream at people. We get ready for 'inspections' 1 hour before an inspection.  People cut fingers, get laid off and don't receive anything. A lot of people sue the meat company. You feel very, very replaceable at a place like this. In one moment a line works with 20-30 people, in the other moment the line shuts down and all people are fired. If we were an 'advanced' civilization, meat factories would not exist ;( Unfortunately it is one of the richest industry (together with the twin evil brother - dairy industry). Big, big lobby.
That is DISGUSTING!
He's not funny.
Go vegan
LWT is becoming like 2014-2015 LWT again because Trump is gone YAY
I was honestly expecting to hear about the Hamlet chicken plant fire of 1991,  where a faulty hydraulic system leaked and started a fire that killed 25 workers because, as Mojo Nixon put it, the boss man chained the doors closed. And all the other shit at that plant, like making the meat into chicken nuggets to hide the fact much of the meat was rotten.
It's disgusting how companies use -legalized bribery- *lobbying* to deregulate to the point that workers are exploited like this.
#BoycottMeat and all other animal products, cruelty and exploitation in any way possible!
This is not a US problem, Germany has it too, the difference is that German companies hire sub-sub-sub-contractors to get workers. Many of those are Eastern European from poorer EU states, who are employed in their country of origin (even though they are most of their time in Germany and face the higher costs of living, despite receiving effectively less than the required minimum wage).  The issues look almost the same with covid-19, healthcare and working environment, but the difference is, that the companies are using subcontractors to rid themselves of responsibility.  I think both countries got some work ahead of them.
We can all say this much I’m sure. Fuck you guys. Poor worker treatment needs to start getting serious. People y’all need to stand up.

Oh boy more negative national attention on my home state. Fuck Iowa

Corporations are out of control in USA.
Sadly, there is much more industries than meatpacking where corporate employees live very comfortably while warehouse/meatpacking/any sort of manual labor employees are treated sub-human
America is a business,  NOT a country
"We live in a nation where people have to launch GoFundMe campaigns for medical treatment"  Me: *laughs in European*
I buy my meat from local places that aren't owned by those tyrants and avoid fast food trash. Doing my part as much as I can. I have a JBS plant close to where I live and back in the beginning, they were purely the cause of the virus exploding from a single digit cases in the county, to hundreds in a very short amount of time. Never shut the plant down through it all. Hit the news and everything. I highly doubt they were fined at all for it either. Greatest country on the planet. Keep it up.
I've just stared watching. It's a video about bad circumstances related to the meat industry. And I'm eating an apple. Maybe I should finish my food before watching? :)
you are right john oliver. you are fucking right

The elated alphabet extremely sail because sausage pragmatically multiply to a actually sweatshirt. irritating, caring tyvek
I didn't know I needed another reason to be glad I don't eat meat, but ok I'll take it since you're offering...
If you think the solution is to go vegetarian/vegan, you missed the point. Focus on the worker conditions.   FYI: Because of the Fair Labor Standards Act, agriculture workers are exempt from overtime provisions. In California, there will finally be overtime   paid after 40 hrs starting next year for agriculture workers. This is the tip of the iceberg.
This tv-show makes me appreciate all work laws in my country, and how good we have compared to say the usa
Do one on the farmer protest in india...
my friends mom worked at pilgrims pride in Dallas... it was awful. but yeah she felt like she didn't have many other options in the area they lived and being an immigrant.
Another reason I'm glad I'm vegan so I'm not complicit with the human suffering caused by this industry. If you think you can't give up animal products, then take a look at all the alternatives now. It's never been easier to be vegan.
Corporations consider workers to be a resource to be exploited and discarded. An expense to be minimized which certainly have no rights. They. Do. Not. Care. They feel nothing but content.
Give people a real wage so they can afford real food substitute produce rather than meat and dairy. Make those conditions illegal and watch the real price of meat and dairy reveal itself it’s gonna be meat every other week like it’s used to be, real fast.
And then there are people who still believe Covid came from laboratory...
One of the reasons I switched completely to farm based meat ordering.  Cost a little more but well worth it
So under the "forgotten people will no longer be forgotten" president the government department who helps creates safer (safer, not safe) working environments got cut further? I would like to pretend that Trump had something to do with this. But let's be honest: He doesn't give a shit about the workers apart from when they are cheering for him or threatening politicians that dare to challenge him.
If a job says they'll treat you like family then it's a red flag. Cause to them family is someone to abuse and guilt trip.
Dammend those Americans look fat... or big boned.... or my screen ratio isn't set right. Hmmm. Humans shouldn't look that way.
MUUUUURICAAAAAA FUCK YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAH
I like your show but I don't take knowledge that I don't need in my life
Here is a crazy thought: stop eating so much meat
Why me an Algerian watching news about meat industry hr problems in the US again?
There is also a history of these meatpacking plants making false IDs and SSNs on site for illegal immigrants to work in their plants, cause heavens forbid that they hire Americans who knows their rights.
Somehow I thought /wished meat packing referred to the new Republican party members in the house
Ha ha, it’s like they could sense I was dealing with suicidal ideation already & just wanted to turn the heat up.
God bless you
COMPANY PRESIDENT: Do what not the company can do for you but do what you can do for the company!  EMPLOYEE: Say what?
this is what its like to work at amazon, 2.5 seconds per part. we have to work faster than our higher ups can even manage to do.
Let's talk about every bad thing meat consumption causes on this show, horrific conditions for animals, for workers, will most likely cause the next pandemic, causes deforestation etc. But god forbid anyone suggests we stop eating meat. Because taste and how what you were raised to believe are so much more important than suffering and the death of a planet we all live on.
It’s called the American dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it!  - George Carlin  Or because it’s a fucking nightmare.  -me

The "guinea pig commercial" is a metaphor for how much fuck is given by the meat Companies about their meat packer employee's welfare...😔
Honestly this is just the tip of the iceberg, in many industries all over the nation citizens and non citizens are held hostage, forced to give up their lives and livelihoods, beaten down and crippled.  All so these mega corporations can make massive sums of money so they can buy out their competitors.  There's a massive game of king of the mountain going on right now, and it's a win win for these companies.  They get to pretend to be lean as they pile money in the coffer, funnel it back to the corporate office in preparation for the next buy out.  Pathetic wages keep workers desperate and immobile.  Huge sums of money flood into lawmakers to write laws in favor of their activities and protect them from responsibility.  While the lawmakers for years have drummed up paranoia and divisiveness to keep Americans arguing with each other about bullshit to distract from this grand giveaway.  We need labor reform NOW, we needed it 40 years ago, but we've been given the same excuse that if we regulate business, it will destroy the economy.  When we find what actually does destroy the economy is a free for all market where you can get away with everything, well until you crash the market and whine that you're too big to fail so you can cash in on taxpayer money.  This country is broken.
You think that is bad....   Take a look at the Steel Industry.

🇺🇸 I love my country, and I cheer along anytime someone says America the greatest country on Earth, but in the back of my mind I'm always thinking, "Is it though? Is it reeeally?". 🤔
While you are buying these products, you are almost certainly supporting these corporations. All while there are HEALTHIER alternatives that don't require this treatment of people or cruelty to animals or destruction of our planet.
They only "suspended" the pee guy. Lol

If you hear your boss use the words "Family," or "Team," or "Ranch Flavored," brace yourself. Here is comes.
It's ironic that most of these workers probably vote Republican because "unions are Communist" which makes them anti-Dem. The irony is that by voting the most anti-union and most pro-business party (Dems are not innocent on this score by any stretch but they're the lesser of two evils), they're like turkeys voting for Christmas.
I can't wait until America inevitably collapses more spectacularly than a dying star
America has been made from imigrantes and Republicans are demons always attacking them and mistreating and abusing them and on top of that they get deported back to their countries how cowardly and dirty is our government.
Aaa yes USA the greatest country in the world . Like anyone would the f**k believe that.
Many Americans don't care anyway.. That's the real problem.

Just another reason for me to not eat meat. The meat is (for me) just not worth this disgusting industry
So it appears that the US is operating roughly at the standards of the UK during Industrial Revolution, where workers were exploited and left without recourse if they were injured and their family desolate if they died at the workplace.   Government organisations like OSHA aren't just a really good idea, they're probably the only thing that can keep scum like that which runs these mega-conglomerates from doing their worst.
America is a garbage country...
weird, here in germany our biggest covid hotspot we ever had was also a meatpacking plant that didnt give a shit about its workers :)
Treat companies as you would treat people. In most cases, both would act on the basis of enlightened self-interest. Reward or punishment - say a tax credit (which the company probably already gets) or a proportionate fine (to either deter or serve as an example to others). The picture usually becomes crystal clear then.
#4 Adam Driver   #5 Family
Try to only eat meat from a butcher supplied by local farms. It's pricier, but you eat less meat, that tastes better, is better for your health, and from farms with decent animal population. But because the US have their farmland concentrated where nobody lives, you get meat in plastic. It's like wanting to eat "fresh" fish in the middle of the Sahara desert.
Beautiful just beautiful America The Great
It's the USA, what do you expect? The only reason slavery went out of vogue was it's cheaper for corporations to provide shit wages  & conditions to employees, than it is to actually own them. Employees are disposable, slaves are a capital investment. Face it, the biggest difference between US & Chinese workers is the Chinese standard of living has increased dramatically in the last few decades. It's a Third World nation with a huge military.
Reminds me of german firm Tönnies.........hmmmmmmmmmm
These are so bad without an audience
Alternative Title: Coronavirus X
Greetings from Germany same stuff over here 🙋‍♂️ Just google "Toennies corona". (Clemens Toennies is a Meat Producer in Germany) We had an outrage in the Media last summer. Guess what things still go the way John described and nobody cares.
We should all donate to ProPublica, they do such important work.  They pull back the curtain on so many incomprehensible injustices perpetrated against people who are working  in conditions that should have shut down the plants years ago due to practices that are not legal for treatment of animals much less treatment of humans.  We have four years to clean this up before the lobbiests come roaring back into the plants to take away any progress made to the abysmal working conduct reported out by vital nonprofits like .ProPublica..
20 minutes of rant and not a single mention on how the consumption of animal products is the main issue behind this shit. Go vegan and stop funding this psychotic companies.
I have been seeing people saying that the US is a third world country masquerading as a first world country and I have no problem believing it.
If you really want to know how these places work, check the book "Every Twelve Seconds" by Timothy Pachirat. Educate yourself about this issue.
Yes, explain to us meatpacking, John. Sneer down upon our inferior meat-related practices, and filet us with your tongue until we ourselves become a supple mignon; ready for you to carve up and sear upon your cast iron skillet of facts, you bastion of things I did not know I needed you to explain. Tell it to me slow.
Dude... You know you fucked up when even fucking Romania is lightyears ahead of you when you claim to be a first world country. I'm a damn factory worker and we get private health care.
Their employees are extremely low-skilled workers. This is a good ad for staying in school. And. just do a piece on anarchism and you won't have to keep telling the same story over and over.

and it's not just Meat Factory work...but most Factory jobs
Thank goodness John is back! 😍
Big news: everything around meat suck. As I said about last John Oliver show (pandemic link with meat production and consuption): go vegan.
These companies could and should have done much more, however let's be clear on one thing: if those plants had put in full safety measures including worker distancing, meat production would have been greatly reduced. Fine by me, temporary meat rationing would be well justified. Actually, we eat FAR too much meat in wealthy countries and it is destroying the planet.
That commercial is still stuck in my head 😳.   Thanks again Mr Colbert.
It’s amazing (and tragic) how little has changed since Upton Sinclair published “The Jungle” back in 1906.
Eat need to be alot more expensive. Less subsidies, better conditions for workers, less profit, slowly dying industry.
Oh no, I did not expect upton Sinclair’s jungle 2
WTF America....have some shame...and some humanity for your fellow citizens... it would embarrass a 3rd world country
It's a more difficult question than this but... This is why you need unions
My, I guess I'd rather stay in my country than go to the "Land of the Free"
Ah, industry exposés, just like the old days.
Why did you move here again?  look I helped my mum pass her test... but was it worth it?
Big Problem indeed; But not unique to the "Meat Industry". Do you want to actually tackle the problem? Here is an advice from an Ignorant citizen... Take a hard look at the origin. Keynesian Economics! Nothing organically sane has or ever will come out from such an Inorganical set of Economic Framework rules. The US and 90% of the so-called Free World for that matter adopted this framework since the XX century and is plainly and simply a gross mistake. Giving life to this bureaucratic, inefficient, and unaccountably corrupt system. Free Market. People! That has always been the answer but not this contorted and prostituted version of it. Hayek had it right from the beginning.
Meat packing: violating worker’s rights since Teddy Roosevelt’s era
You forgot that about 100 a month is pulled from your check for ppe. 20 or more gloves a day at 15 bucks a box. The armor was very expensive, atleast it was only a deposit.
i guess gallows humor is punishable by cancellation...it’s good to shine a light on terrible working conditions, abuse, filth, monopolies but the reason people make jokes is because that’s the reality they deal with... people suck, corporations blow...we’re all going to hell. thanks a lot.
The Tyson chicken plant makes working in an Amazon warehouse look like a huge upgrade.. even if you have to piss in a bottle at both.   At least I don't have the other employees looking at me while I do it.. 😣 seriously, there's no personal space in that chicken line..
Thank for doing this amazing work where no one gives shit about.
I was today years old when I found out that John Oliver is one year younger than me. Somehow he looks older.
Shocking, but one also has to examine the whole production cycle from farming to retail chains and how the whole process is dominated by financial interests continually applying pressure to make food cheaper.
wow he seems do much angrier in this one than normal... i think covid broke our homie J-dawg

John Oliver: "I have no interest in seeing Miss Piggy's Sex Tape. Me who happened to watch John's interview with Colbert where they discovered what muppet he'd be: "Uh-huh, don't you mean YOUR sex tape?" XD
As a European, seeing all these American people be overweight is just shocking
Imagine living such a sheltered life that your biggest problem is managers taking bets on if other employees gets the flu.  1+ billion people are looking skeptically at you snowflakes.
Growing up in Nebraska I remember when meat packing was decent work & paid good money. Then the eighties hit and Reagan, union busting, plus big government is the problem. Now here we are in an Upton Sinclair story.
How is corruption and capitalism working for you all?
I gotta ask if you can do a video on how mechanics get passed around more than your average tool. I have military training so I could be making about 20$ an hour with big businesses while small local shops which are way more abundant would struggle to give heavy equipment mechanics I should specify. A barely livable wage for literal body breaking labor. It blows my mind I have to get a cdl and prove I'm a first responder after military training shows how segregated our private sector and government sectors really are in terms of cooperation and just helping people. I know every different level of fire extinguishers but until I pass a civilian test confirming it they won't just take my military credentials on life saving tactics in stressful situations. This could be more of a state thing because I am in rural america maybe my family job has just been hit by the pandemic so hard 300$ a week is what I was limited to before covid though. People think weve ended slavery but we just replaced it with labor for cash to survive. I would say most people can't pick up fully inflated tires. I can and don't get paid more for doing so and I don't think I should be paid more than an average mechanic but at a 24/7 business that is only now slowing down after my father the only expert operator we have left getting hit by a fully loaded ups truck. The company won't even offer to pay my fathers medical bills. As a company we are starting to question why. And it's starting to crumble. The same problem I had with continuesly serving as well. People didnt care about me so why should I care about them I know its very sinacle of me but at some point we all ask if its worth it. I used to believe it was worth my life till I saw the worth of my life in comparison to big companies. Because a 40 year diesel shop shouldn't go down over the mistakes of bigger companies that have been around half the time. We used to let the money flow through this industry before companies like ups stepped in and others with personal interests are literally keeping the closest responders away to push money towards businesses with deaths. Hansers has had multiple operators die in montana so they have been boosted to the top of the responder list. This shocked my family. When you die during a job. My family doesn't see that as doing a good job. So after the recent wreck its actually increased my dada suicidal thoughts. He thinks if he wouldve died our company would be at the top. But without him no company. So very interested to here what some people think of things like this.
That's capitalism for ya... Workers have to soil themselves, so as to quickly overproduce chicken,  that a lot of will go into the waste bin...
These Corprate Slavers Need To Be Held For CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY  & CRIMINAL NEGLAGENCE & ANY OTHER CHARGE AGAINST THEM POSDIBLE ... And NOT be given leniency or Pleeagrements of Any Sort! THEY SHOULD HAVE THE BOOK THROWN AT THEM!
That whole corporate office was full of Karens when they were exercising. No wonder conditions are horrible.
You can choose to not  eat meat, not use amazon or other companiea that treat their workers like robots. How about that ? Reform takes forever when it comes to government agencies. Next time you crave a burger, think  about that man that gave away his rights with a pen in his mouth.
new bird flu out break H8 IN RUSSIA
John is a globalist shill. Hence Bill Gates saying we need to stop eating meat a couple days ago. Fu<ck you John, im still eating meat. P.s. you do know that those meat packing cases were all asymptomatic aka PCR tests were on a high cycle and they were false positives.
America: third world country with a Birkin bag.
There's a stop right down the line from the MPP that is a lower cesspool.  Walmart Distribution Centers get the finished product, and the company does the same paperwork and legal shuffle as those bastards.   "Are you sure it hurts that bad?" "this action item isn't to reprimand you, it's to keep track for us, but if you do anything like this again within a year, we won't be able to continue your employment, we have a safety culture here. Now. We've just gotten our year over year, and reduced the time you have to complete your daily tasks, you have 8 hours to finish 10 hours of work, but do it safe, floors are wet, good luck."
America, what a shit hole.
So literally every pyramid structured workforce in America u.u
Ever heard of Clemens Tönnies in Germany? The CEO of Tönnies Holding, a "family business" in the meat industry. The working conditions in the slaughterhouses were so bad, that there too was a Covid-19 outbreak... So you are not alone America.  Fun fact: He was also the chairman of german soccer club Schalke 04. Where he was let go, next to other reasons (like causing a Covid outbreak), telling people in africa that they should stop "breeding in the dark".
So the meat industry tortures the animals? Including the humans? Huh
So those 5 people were worth 3k to that company? maybe a bit more? I'm sure they sent lovely gift baskets to the families with nice little pink and white cards on top that read- "sorry, not sorry <3 <3"  I've been on unemployed for 4 months now but when the boss tells me to come back in i might tell him to stuff it. I'm making 18/hr and still often cant afford to pay bills on time. I've been rocking a ten year old phone and avoiding my avocado toast and I'm still poor- FUCK these rich people. Honestly we call ourselves 'americans' like that means something and then proceed to get stepped on every day.  its embarrassing. Hell, to go further than that we call ourselves 'sentient' then get pushed around by 5% of us.  When it gets warm again I'm doing something, and it starts with quitting my place in this system- ever so kindly bestowed down to me... I'm Done with this matrix b.s.
Dog bliss you John...  You are the eyes We need to see.
Did this for years. Holton Meats in Sauget IL
The single reason why all this shit is happening is because of every time someone wants change in the US some idiot screams "B-B-BUT THAT WOULD BE SOCIALISM!!!!1!!"  Start to really educate people and teach them critical thinking, wait 50 years to let all the boomers die and maybe your country will be a little more functional.
The parched business baly protect because mini-skirt untypically ski for a offbeat slave. serious, spiteful soda
In retrospect I wonder what the best option would have been. Because lets say OSHA had stepped in back in March and said "every poultry plant must double the distance between workers". The result would have been laying off half the workers, and producing have the chicken. So mass starvation basically. Long term obviously OSHA should slowly increase regulations (and be given the funding to enforce them), allowing companies to expand their facilities in line with regulations without having to decrease production. But maybe (as terrible as this sounds) a couple hundred workers dying from COVID was the outcome that caused the least amount of total human suffering. That said, these mega corporations should be eating the cost of the pandemic, no the workers and their families, and not future generations of Americans (ie debt and inflation).
This is pretty much why I will never visit the US..  Companies wanna make a profit, I get that. But in any normal country the rules and rights should always be FOR the the employees to protect them so that they can work and feel safe. It seems like they are pretty much as disposable as the chickens in the video! I really can't get my head around how insane it is, not only that the rules are as they are, but that the companies actually are acting on the loopholes and treat people like this.. it just shows that something is twisted in the top mens heads if you ask me. Because no normal person would tell their workers not to see the doctor if they needed to? And definitely not tell your workers that they probably should wear a diaper to work, or am I wrong? Can anyone name ONE person that could tell you "you're not allowed bathroom breaks, and you can't visit your doctor if you get injured" and you would still be okay with them? I can't. No one. Family, celebrity, rolemodel... no one on this planet should be allowed to be such a dick. Ever!
Really important topic.  Just sad LastWeekTonight had to "woke" part of it into a racial thing.  Salary workers 73.1% white vs 31.7% White on the hourly workers.  Like it is a racial thing that dictates what job you have and not the educational path.
I worked for Tyson for 3 years. That's why I'm a vegetarian today.
Dear America, under the skin you too are just another third world country!!
Funny that's an old Nazi joke, the officer says sign the papers saying you're unharmed, the old man says I can't, the officer asked why can't you sign the papers saying we have not hurt you, the old man replies because you have broken all of my fingers.. funny. I'm the dancing demon watch me twirl and hop and spin I'm quick to give a smile but I won't forgive your sins.
There was this phrase - "living the American dream", many people went to the USA to search for something better. Well, now, I am glad I live in Europe. At least we have a normal healthcare system. And aren't there supposed to be laws that protect workers from such conditions? Don't people have rights?
Plant based is the way to go!!!!
I love living in Finland. Just saying.
Aaaand in the comments we have the usual suspects: "We are still better than North Korea!" because that is a high bar to clear.  And plenty of "It's not better anywhere else!" and "Europe is the same!" Not remotely true, I've worked in a meat factory in Europe, one the best jobs I've ever had.  Nothing like these human misery factories in what some unironically call the greatest nation on earth.
It's weird seeing Smithfield in the national spotlight; that job was the most inhumane job I've ever worked. What the supervisors do up in there is horrific. And they be fuckin all the workers literally
It’s the awful truth that you go two three rungs up and suddenly workers aren’t people any more with families. Just numbers on a spreadsheet. :/
I work in one of these companies plants.  While I think the company was a little slow to implement Covid procedures,  those procedures have been implemented for more than 8 months.  Short of complete shutdown, I do not think they can do much better.  There is a large immigrant population, but Americans that are born in America rarely last more than two weeks due to having to work in 45 degree F or lower rooms.  The immigrants just want the jobs more.  For the record, I am veteran who has worked in the same plant for more than 15 years and am not a member of management due to my choice.  It is possible that the plant I work in is the exception, but I doubt it.
Poor working conditions  Corrupt individuals  Immoral corporations Etc.   *Flashbacks to reading “The Jungle” in high school*
The meatpacking industry is absolutely disgusting. Its necessary for the world to go vegan.
Thank you for an episode about something other than the Orange Liar. Very refreshing! Love the show
Where would you rather work, Meatpacking or Amazon? Vote now.
"Inspector with box over her head", turns out skyrim wasn't as rediculous as I thought it was.
"While a perverted owl just watches." John Oliver sounds like he's very proud of how he is being portrayed in that painting there.
Capitalism baby.
Hmmm...forced labour..... allegedly.
Sickening! How the industry is being handled.
Go vegan for the animals, including the human ones.
Nothing like sad facts to lull me to sleep
At this point, there really isn't much difference between USA and China in how they treat their people ...
Funny thing, in “developing” countries we call that the same as slavery, so which is worse? Usa doing this shit or knowing the countries usa calls shithole actually deal with this stuff?
I'm still upset Netflix cancelled The Patriot Act.... But at least we have John Oliver.
😌👏🏻
“The Jungle .2” Brought to you by John Oliver Published by HBO
God, I missed you guys during the pandemic.
Yea, USA sucks ass but I’m stuck here. At least I can buy a gun real easy.
All this misery for products that contribute to six of the ten leading causes of death in the USA. And that's while ignoring the abject misery of the zoological holocaust that is the meat industry. It is a miserable business swimming in an ocean of blood, feces, urin and the lives of innocents.
What the fuck is wrong with Beau Pilgrim's head?  It's like his massive skull is sucking his face inside itself.
That's ultra capitalistism for you
I'm glad he took his gloves off
John they fired me after I got injured in order to skip light duty pay. The only thing I got out of it was 6month unemployment and a displaced shoulder.
Wow, USA really is a terrifying carnival of horrors and I'm glad I live in central Europe
Osha needs more power....
The position itself needs to be eliminated. Traditional agricultural methods are not sustainable with our carrying capacity. Vitro meat and hydroponics is the way forward. Not only does it give cities a means to be nutritionally self sustaining, it enables a vast amount of farm land to be return to a natural ecological state, and it can produce more meat in less time without a single animal death than the traditional birth to slaughter process. It's ethical, ecological, and economical.
I’m glad to have sold my Tyson shares 3 weeks ago and invest instead on Riot Blockchain. Perhaps my highlight for this month.
Corporations are "PEOPLE TOO"...wtf?
I think we should all buy local. Jesus man.

weird, it's almost as if we should stop eating meat
Animal eaters are complicit in this. Vegans have been speaking about this for YEARS.  If this is news to you that's a result of choices.
30 fucking years! And he got tossed to the waist side, fuck this country
the good O'capitalism
10:30
I just saw the thumbnail and thought: "This is going to be another cheery one, isn't it?"
It seems easier not to eat meat and persuade others to do the same than  improving those companies.
I don’t want to be that person but I believe that we as consumers are also slightly responsible for this. There is too much demand for meat, poultry etc. and when there is demand, companies seek ways to profit from it as much as possible. Eating meat every day, a couple of times a day is not natural, and it didn’t use to be the standard for living for a long time. This isn’t a vegan/ vegetarian propaganda, but I believe that reducing the intake of animal products would benefit everyone.
Time to once again thank my lucky stars for living in Finland...... 😳
How people dont do a second frech Revolution with the rich worldwide is beyond me by now.
Turns out weregild never went away
Corporations are trying to treat OSHA inspectors like skyrim shopkeepers...
But why is it that, that was his only option. How fucked up are the working conditions?
John Oliver’s a clown! WOW
Haha! Expecting the Biden administration to change anything is fluffing hilarious!
After legal expenses I was paid a total of $800 for a workplace injury that was caused by this industry.  I can't sleep on my left side for the rest of my life, and that was apparently worth $800.  Thanks assholes.
if it's this bad in american companies then just imagine how bad it is in off shore companies
we really are just pretending to be a first world nation at this point.
And all of that revolves around something we all eat. Every day.
Considering no one over there is actually willing to pay more for meat, the whole process will probably just become more automated. Everyone likes to hate on cheap labor, then still demand low prices🤷‍♂️
Thank you for pointing out immigrant workers.  American workers will demand higher pay and a better standard.
Wat.
I just watched Extra Credits video on Roosevelt cracking monopolies because it was bad. clearly he missed the root of the issue : america is fucked up at heart, everyone is someone else's prey.  but only john is prey to even the pigeons 😉
I'll pack your meat Oliver, don't be sassin.
can we criticize Biden's administration later?
Eating dead animals that didn't need to die, seems to be less and less nessaery.
The chickens were all complaining that the worker stopped processing them, removed the gloves and peed under the table. "We don't get the respect we deserve. We demand gloves to take off when we have to pee!" Outside the factory the protesters are demonstrating for "Pee-free" chickens.  Processing-line factories should pay a 10% bottom-line worker protection and be held responsible for infractions and on-job accidents. A pandemic outbreak of more than 0.1% of the workers should call forth a comparable fee (not penalty) to be paid directly to the workers. A penalty compensation should be imposed by a strong-willed OSHA.
Fines will never work against companies unless the fine just outright destroys them. If you think critically about all the potential ways you could fine a company and make them care there are always ways to circumvent them. Make it cost a % of the income? Just dont have income and keep spending it all to expand. Make it based on how much the worker earned the company? Constantly rehire them or hire new people. The biggest issue i have with this is that companies get to exploit their workers because they are supposed to be liable for these issues. If they cant arse themselves to care just so they earn max profits they just shouldnt be allowed to have workers anymore. It would actually start hurting the company for them to lose factory line workers if they were banned from hiring people until conditions improve.
Fucking Capitalism at its finest, sponsored by coorperate America finest. It's worse than a Communist Authoritarian Country. Land of the Slaves and and imprisoned.
No surprise there. Is anyone doing anything about it?
That guinea pig commercial is actually a really good metaphor for Tyson’s business practices.
Thank god I’m vegan 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
To be fair.. Tyson claiming to be a "family"...is equally as dysfunctional as my real family.
You are my president, John.
American labour laws are next to worthless because a) the knowledge of them is neglible 2) the unions are weak 3) strong corporations ignore them 4)simply starting a legaslative process cost money meaning that the ones that are actually suffering because of faults in the system, the poor cannot start the process of fixing the faults. It litteraly takes death and mass outbreaks of cancer and amputation for a problem to fix in the US.
Too last week tonight show writters: I do not like that man Ted Cruz. It's not always good when he is in the news. I do not like his political oral one liners. I am aware Ted Cruz is a liar? I do not watch when Ted Cruz is on fox news. That man Ted Cruz can go floss his teeth with my ****'s
20 bucks that those "we treat employees like family" dudes were also onboard with "grandma can die for the economy" rhetoric.
I worked at a relatively small Chicken plant in Decatur AL (Wayne's Farms). They really do treat their people like this for slightly above min wage. It was horrifying.
I really like this john oliver guy...  pretty sad to hear he just suddenly took his own life with two shots to the back of the head
Yup have 2 much hate and fake "news" this is garbage
Tom cruise is now a meat packer.
This is some real shit, the Foster Farms near me is rampant with Covid. They've had hundred of employee test positive and a lot of have died. S/o to the 209 smh
My gods, this is just another reason I count myself lucky to be able to not contribute to the processed meat industry (I live on my family's ranch where we raise/process our own animals for consumption). Not only are the working conditions HORRENDOUS, but getting fired over seeing a doctor in your own time?? Seriously what the fuck is wrong with those people in charge putting their employees through all that?!?🤦🏼‍♀️🤬😧
1:20 "Those conditions are horrific, but they do get talked about a lot".  Well, it's not talked about enough in my opinion. The general public knows that there's some standard practices that's "probably not right", but they have no clue about the details, like gas chambers, macerators and much more. The animal industry needs a serious reform, but as long as the demand for meat is increasing and governments are subsidising the industry, it's not gonna happen quick enough.
9:57 A blank 10,000 dollar check? Wait, what? Which is it? It can't be both, lol.
It is modern slavery.We had a similar case in Germany. Tönnies a company that focuses on pigs had a bad covid outbreak.Then it came out how badly they treated the mostly eastern european workers...I dont buy anything with their name on it anymore..
Lol thank god am from a 3rd world country, atleast if S H I T like this goes on we can justify it. USA is a joke and they preach others how to do things, No thanks A S S H O L E S !! as a nation they S U C K. ignorance is also part of the problem
stop eating that trash simple as that
Least sexy "Meatpacking" video ever.
I’ll say it as John won’t ever, the ONLY solution is going vegan.
The lessons from The Jungle fell on too many deaf ears, despite it's popularity. The efforts to try to keep people safe have remained a joke when profits can be made.
"We family at this company" means We will exploit you like a company would, but when you complain, we'll emotionally manipulate you.
One of the benifits of living in an Asian country is that we can literally see the chicken we're about to eat
you are so based daddy
So called free market with all those monopolies. Capitalism is a joke
Thank you for this crazy piece and for contributing to the argument that people should be vegan or Farm their own damn food
That's like having sympathy for concentration camp guards. If you work in an industry that's this cruel to animals, why should you deserve anything but malice and misfortune?
Slaughterhouse workers also have some of the highest rates of PTSD and suicide. All of that blood, feces and death gets to you. Even if you think you're a tough guy. Go vegan, save slaughterhouse workers ✨
I have to admit, as much as I thought about it at all, I thought meat packaging was mostly automated, not some kind of assembly line from 200 years ago...  Could someone tell me all the evil effects of being a vegan? I really don't want to become one but...
11:15
Seems to me like a pandemic is revelaing more and more how people with vital, but underpaid and underappreciated jobs, keep getting kicked in the teeth and HAVE TO endure it, to secure an income, because the systems in play enable businesses to doing it. Even seeing lots of businesses receiving  COVID-19 relief for fake employees etc. People sicken me!!
People are animals too John, people are animals too...
Am I selfish for thinking it's sucks he couldn't cover the capital hill riot or the Texas freezing storm?
What meat u packing John
You mean to tell me an industry based on torturing and killing living beings does not care about its employees' safety? Well color me surprised!
That's why vegetarians and vegans in my country frustrate me when they say "It'S aBoUt ThE aNiMaLs InNoCeNcE" it's not about the animals lives or about if it's moral to eat them or not. It's always about the conditions. The people conditions, and the animals conditions, which isn't bad here because we mostly get are meat sources from local farmers and herders and we don't have large or big meat manufacturers. But no, We ReAd It In ThE iNtErNet AnD wE wIlL dO wHaT tHeY sAy To Us BeCaUsE aMeRiCa iS tHe SaMe As EvErYwHeRe ElSe.
Every time I watch this show, it ruins my life.  Achingly upset every time.
All workers are disposable.  That's why they're called workers.
So Germany and USA have in common that they treat their meatpacking employees horribly. Interesting?
#JustCapitalismThings
You can come in but put a box on your head.........   If any body thought that is ok, I reserve the right to question the intelligence and humanity of those individuals.
Never buying Tyson products again...ever.
Next one on farmer protest and facism of modi government in India
I thought john would naturally empathize with that erotic fowl painting in the foyer, but it seems not (or so he says)
Capitalism :)
All the Haitians and Mexicans at the chicken plants around me get paid cash under the table :/ these plants don't care about people
Learning about this makes me fucking sick ! Fired for going to the doctor on your own dime ? Fucking hell this is fucked up !!
I was on the killing floor and anti fog glasses couldn't cope with the steam from hot water so I just accepted the fact that blood would splash into my eyes all day. I did faces, the blood vessels that come out of the cheeks through the bone spray all over like you wouldn't believe. We did seconds that were all meffed the suck up for sausage. It was terrible. Go home and vomit in the shower when the death ran off. Now I have an absurd case of carple tunnel from knife work.
my mom works for Heinz in the summer and every year there is someone who loses a couple of limbs
Is there a % of human crap legally allowed in these products - the UK is lucky - it will soon adopt these standards.
There’s no ethical way to exploit animals; especially when there are alternative plant-based sources available to you. Boycott all animal derived products with me.
I'm reminded a bit of The Jungle by Upton Sinclair.  Edit 01: Ah yes, repetitive stress injury... a point I liked to make clear to my coworkers when I worked at UPS in a sorting facility. My facility also failed to keep up with the first aid kits for the two years I worked there. For some reason, our facility had its spending card frozen by the company. Our facility was a year or two old in 2018, built new at an airport. Our facility couldn't buy the first aid kit supplies because of that. Why the hell?
Why does Bill Pilgrim look like Melissa McCarthy doing an SNL impression of Bill Pilgrim?
My dad worked in meat packing and there were lots of lost hands and heart attacks.
A fraction of a fu ck
Well I'm done with Tyson
The week before: the next pandemic- the show ignores who is actually responsible  This week: condition in meat packing plants- let’s ignore it again... If you are funding these industries with your money you are creating these issues! If you are not vegan you are responsible.. Go vegan and support businesses that neither exploit animals nor humans.. Oh and Go vegan if you don’t want humanity to be wiped out by pandemics...figures... Sick of everyone avoiding personal responsibility! If you claim to care you must walk the walk!
Just to throw this in here. There are many US companies who have locations in other countries. In many of these countries the workers - for the same amount of labor - earn more, money, get more sick days, have health insurance.  Why? Because state laws are above company policies and many countries have laws that protect the workers. It's not that companies are less evil because want to.   You guys need to get better laws to protect the citizen.
We had a special needs assistant at our school (if a kid was in a wheelchair, she'd help them get out their books, or if they had cerebral palsy and they needed help eating at lunch, stuff like that) who told us horror stories about working for the plant across town. She didn't even open up about it until one of us asked why she didn't eat meat (it was the Midwest in the '90s, vegetarianism was not a thing). Then she told us about how they slaughtered the pigs (I'll spare you) and then processed them while they were still warm, that was depressing enough but then she told us about watching one of the workers getting their arm ripped IN TO one of the machines and the workers got a half hour off while they cleaned the line and reset the system. No, they did not get paid during that half hour but she said getting to sit down for 30 minutes was the best day she had at work. They also fired the worker who lost his arm. Good times.
What in the fuck was that commercial?
So basically the South Park "Unfulfilled" episode except with meatpacking factories.
Recommended reading: The Jungle by Upton Sinclair.
These corporate companies continue to take a capitalistic advantage of everyone beneath. Fining them a few thousand isn’t going to be critical to them
An industry which sell litteraly death by million will never have regards about life condition. Animal or Human.
This is why USA have the richest people in the world. Slaves, new or old types
Just a friendly reminder that after Trump dragged his feet before *finally* using the Defense Production Act to actually do something about Covid, he then proceeded to sign an executive order to force meatpacking plants to stay open. 11:35 - Well I mean, come on John, when has deregulation and a lack of concern for the well-being of workers and/or consumers lead to anything bad happening, let alone in Texas specifi- Oh, wait...
Almost all manufacturing jobs are like this. You should look at the ones in China.
Long story short, if you dont know what your career path is, be an OSHA inspector.
Ooh yes let’s play the “I’m financially illiterate” game again John. Revenue and profit are not the same thing. Not even CLOSE. 0.00003% of JBS’s profits in 2016 was $65, not $15000.
Hey John! As a small business owner that is not operating right now  - you’ve piqued my interest with this story! How would you - and those workers like to go into business with me?!
That guinea pig add at the beginning, is a metaphor where that multimillionaire ignores a literal demon behind him to try selling you his shitty product as if nothing was happening and families weren't being murdered by that guinea pig
Family is horrible, so this checks out, honestly.
Yay capitalism! Abuse worker!
The more I learn about how fucked up the social standards are in the States, the happier I am to live in Europe. You know, where you live in an industrialized world and have basic human rights, even if you're not a millionaire.
I'm in the meaty industry... And fucking hell do I want out.
in conclusion: this is capitalism’s fault. but when is something not?
Two words: strong Unions. If these plants come under a general strike for a few weeks, maybe something will change.
So I work in a factory, and although it's not great it's far from the worst and I know this. I spend a small amount of time thinking about how other factories operate. I NEVER considered that standards in a food plant like Tyson were so bleak. I generally feel for these people. Im "kinda" well off, but I know that it gets much worse. The worst part of this video is I know it gets worse then even this in this country.
i would love to travel to the US for some real-life doomscrolling
Gosh, I missed you so much ☹
So an industry built on the exploitation of animals, treats their lowest wage staff badly. Big surprise.
Time to go vegan friends 🤝
Jesus, USA is an effing dystopia... How the hell can country still be so XIXth century...
When you have legalized bribery ( lobbying ) and a President who denies the seriousness of a full blown pandemic,  that is the outcome.
Do you really expect that an industry that prosper on torturing and killing animals will give a fuck about their workers. Just stop supporting this industries.
6:04 I was really hoping for him to say "we live in a society..."
Boooooyyyyyyy the USA is a backwards ass country that neeeeeever seizes to surprise me. Holy fudge.
This episode in particular is making me extremely mad!!! I’m trying to start a business here in Italy and I, correctly, have to take in consideration a million of safety concerns just to open, if I DARED to make a worker TRY to sign a waiver I would be teared to shreds by the state because is HIGHLY ILLEGAL, and then I hear this stories, it’s extremely upsetting; and the joke is that everyone here gets socialized health coverage so is slightly less necessary....
Every episode is getting more bleak I’m just curious how many of John’s staff are on anti-depressants.
3rd world
Greetings from Germany, and Tönnies 👍
This is the price we pay for cheap meat and we increase the demand every time we buy it.  I know human rights violations happen throughout the food industry but it is much more prevalent in animal food.  If the last two episodes of LWT have taught us anything, it’s that we need to stop eating animals.
2:25 some of your jokes are just so weird John.  Judi Dench?  Am I missing something?  Was she is the news lately?  I dunno, just.. what a weird joke.
Anyone person, group or company that gives even a single cent in cash, goods or services to someone with political influence is being corrupt. It needs to stop. Why is lobbying legal? Why do companies get to donate to political campaigns? Citizens get to vote once every 4 years but the wealthy get the vote whenever they want by just opening their wallet.
I caught the end of this episode earlier and "Thank Goodness" I watched this to know WTF the ending was.
15k is less than my net worth and I'm a homeless mentally disabled neet
Wouldn't be surprised if robots take over significant portion of the meatpacking industry in the coming 5 years
Finally some great fucking journalism and actual news worth watching.
Welcome back my boy
Like so many industries, safety comes down to profitability.  If it doesn't add to the bottom line then it's not going to get done.  Politicians only want to be able to claim they brought jobs or kept jobs not that those jobs pay well or are safe to do.  The system feeds on itself.  It's going to take a lot of change to make it better.
I wish you'd taken some time to speak about the grim conditions for the animals. It is 10000% not spoken about enough, especially on shows like yours. You skimmed through this  issue in the previous episode regarding pandemics too, even though, meat eating is one of the key reasons for pandemics! This issue was not discussed enough in climate change discussions too. So please John, stop ignoring the largest population of victims, abused and killed by the trillions, the animals.
Imagine you told an IRS agent to put a box over his head when they are auditing you....
Modern day American slavery!!!..
... Someone please tell me that England and/or Canada is a lot better than this place. Please.

Nothing has changed, USA is built on the backs of slavery
PLEASE TALK ABOUT MATERNAL HEALTH/ REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND ABOUT DAIRY FARMS NEXT (especially milk) !!!
Those are the times when I am glad I am living in Germany.  It's not all rainbows and unicorns here either but compared the US is basically a hellscape.

I seriously think fines shouldn't be flat rates, but a percentage of the person's/business' monthly earnings. If a lower-class person will experience a fine of let's say $500, for example, that same crime committed by a multi-billionaire should result in a fine of several million dollars. Rich people need to experience proper consequences for their crimes, and honestly, making that change could help fix many of the problems this country has, since the government will be receiving large wads of cash as a result (but that's assuming the government would fund the things it should with that money). It's obviously not the brightest idea, but something needs to be done about these heartless companies.
Does this mean that people could get (cannibalism-based illnesses) sick from eating actory produced meat?  Those workers get cuts all the time, bleed at work & some have lost fingers on the job. While working with meat that people buy from the store & eat later at home..... This is a seriouse health risk tithe factory workers & the customers!😨 People could get infected with prions without even knowing it!

During the Trump Administration, the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service approved temporary waivers for more than 50 poultry plants to increase slaughter speeds, including 15 during the pandemic, The Washington Post noted. The withdrawn rule would have made those permanent and allowed other plants to adopt the 175-birds-per-minute line speed without the need to apply for a waiver. 45 per minute? Lol that's small stuff, get onto the 175-BPM! THAT'S real speed. Biden reversed this approval.

Its not just the meat packing industries... Im lookin at you Heinz Ketchup 👀
For me: 1. My phone 2. Food, water, and shelter  3. Bob Ross  4. My family
At least just reduce your meat consumption. You spend less money, live healthier, help to protect the environment, force these meat plants to think over their business strategy, etc. etc.
I don’t understand why immigrants would be less likely to report issues to authorities.
Gee what a surprise - Texas.
This issue is global. It's all about speed on the line, and it's comparable in any other country. The problem isn't even new, it's 100+ years old. But it's always great when carnism is exposed. Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows: An Introduction to Carnism by Melanie Joy explains it very well.
The good news is that those repetitive jobs will be gone in the next 10 years.
The main reason why more isn’t done by the cooperations is because the news dies down fairly quickly after it has blown. Maybe some news outlets start covering it, maybe the cooperations make mild concessions, but definitely everyone moves on in a month.
As a man with no class I kinda liked cluckingham palace and the foyer aesthetically. As an anti-capitalist what I found disgusting was the gross display of opulence.
I’ve had off burgers and tasty burgers...I thought it was just a quality or refrigeration issue.  Now I’m wondering
So how's that free market capitalism working out for you, USA? 😱🤭 I'm so happy I live in "communist" Norway... 😅
OSHA should be going into these plants and hiring line workers as investigators.
This is just one of all the businesses we live off who treat their employees like shit. There's blood on a lot of things we consume every day.
Unfortunately mate, that’s how a lot of companies in the US treat their employees. They talk a big game about family, but they don’t mean it. Toilet breaks are assigned and must be taken at that time.  the time allotted is fine for a male employee, but not female. In the job injuries get you a 🩹 and a Tylenol. Your sick days are the same as your holidays, and you get sacked for going over. They work you like a machine, keeping statistics on everything you do. Those meat packing plant workers probably, like I did get browbeaten by management if they’re under that 1 animal every 2 seconds number.You’re not family, you’re a statistic. In fact, I overheard a senior manager on a conference call with other managers referring to employees as ”unit number” and using standard deviations. I haven’t heard standard deviations since statistics class at university. To the international viewers, yes this really is how it is in the 🇺🇸.
even the communist countries in the 60's treat their worker better than this
video starts; Company; We are like family  thats corp-speak for; we want free labor because the workers are like kids for us who dont deserve money
GO VEGAN OR GO HOME
Woah, it's almost like an industry whose entire business revolves around death and is responsible for the climate crisis, deforestation, species extinction and the emergence of new infectious diseases doesn't care about anything but money. (Sarcastically surprised Kirk)
Hey, wzzm grand rapids. MI (yeah, our little part of the country is the worst...de vos, van andel, prince fam (eric created blackwater), meijer...fred upton (been in the house for over 3 decades)...yeah west mi is the worst :/
Everyone: I love Chicken Nuggets Capitalism:
OSHA's fines are not inflation-adjusted since decades due to a lobby-bill that took this out. Maximum fine - if I remember correctly - is $8000 for a wrongful/negligent death. It's a toothless tiger.
Just give up and move to Australia John.
“Smithfield pork is packaged with abuse”
Jon Oliver attacking animal agriculture 2 weeks in a row My vegan senses are tingling
That's enraging!
This show is finally back on track now that they don't talk about Trump 24/7
It seems like one of the things a regular consumer can do to try to punish these companies for their practices is to contribute to loss of their profits by reducing a meat consumption or even abstaining from it altogether.
When the first ammendment is interpreted as "freedom of bribery", what do you expect companies to do? US lobbying would be blatant corruption in most other democracies.
Ah yes. The Golden days. When governors had integrity.
Same thing here over in europe.
Meditations are a wonderful way to clear your mind of any moral responsibility to dehumanizing your employees...
Not that the meatpacking plants in other parts of the world are any different. Here in the Netherlands, the average worker in a meatpacking plant is, surprise, not from the Netherlands but from Turkey, Morocco, Romania, Poland or Bulgaria. In other words: they rarely speak Dutch (enough) to know their rights. And our inspections are just as inadequate.
Im gonna tell something,  yeah,this is the Company fault but at the end of the day is also a fault from us the consumers, we are expecting more product, faster,  I worked on one of those places when I was younger and saw I guy cut 3 fingers with a machine and that is not fun to watch, companies set those standars cause people keep demanding more producs, if we as a society  slow down these people might get a break, and some of you might say that they only need to hire more people, but more people means more machines, more buildings, etc, from a company perspective it would be easier to make your current workers harder,  I again, I am not justifying the companies,  just putting some perspective and offering options to help in this issue
Quick mathematical/political breakdown, given the numbers stated here, and from other research:   John cites it would take 165 years for OSHA inspectors to inspect every business. Checking the source, at the time, OSHA had 862 Inspectors. Mathematically,  this means that if we wanted to have enough Osha inspectors so that every business could be inspected every, say 10 years, we would need to get 16.5 times more inspectors.   Checking other records, it looks like Inspectors make up somewhere a little under half of OSHA's staff. So, logically, we'll need to increase other roles as well (training personnel, call processing, etc), but probably not QUITE as drastically. However, let's be generous, and round to an even 30x. So for every new 10 new inspectors, we also hire 8 more support staff. This is almost certainly excessive, but again, we're being generous. So we need to hire...25,000 more people, roughly. (30x862 is 25,860, minus the existing 862, for 24,998)   The average wage of an OSHA inspector, according to several sources, is around $50,000 a year. I do NOT have the data to find all the support staff, but let's increase to $55,000 for the congregate, just in case higher wages for more senior inspectors/command staff outweigh the costs of, say, receptionists, janitors, etc. This feels unlikely, but again, I don't have the data to say.   So the total increase to the budget of OSHA would be $1.375 billion a year, before things like "additional office space" and other considerations come into play. This would equate to...roughly $0.92 in additional taxes per month per US taxpayer, minus however much income they generate through additional fines.  It would not be particularly costly to fix this.
Capitalism Fuck Yeah!
I used to work in a Tyson factory and the part about people peeing on the line is absolutely true. It doesn't surprise me that the corporate side live in luxury, but the production side suffers.   I mostly dealt with the frozen side of things, making boxes, shoveling ice and packing boxes to get ready for shipping. The orientation video was interesting, they outright admit to being a slaughterhouse and showed graphic images about what they call "Live hang", where the employees grab the living chickens and put their legs on metal hooks so the chickens are hung upside down to be roasted and defeathered while still alive. The employees have to wear masks because of all the chicken poop flying everywhere, and it smells absolutely disgusting.  Anyone have any questions? I may be able to answer some.
American business are really heartless
11:20 the owls are not what they seem
Captialism strike again ... profit over human life is never a good thing
It’s actually 1.phone 2.Food/water 3.Kristen Bell 4.Family
Easy consequence everyone: stop eating meat! ;) nice Side effects include - reducing climate crisis tremendously - animal suffering reduced - No moral conflictions of letting other people kill for my taste - much much more healthy what did i forget? Ah on a long term help these workers who are getting exploited
Or "what happens when big business owns the government"
Go vegan 🤪
Slavery ks bigger than ever
This was not the video I was expecting to find when I searched for "John Oliver Meatpacking".
Sigh. One family fighting another family. Nice job using covid instill hate against the meat industry. Automobile industry also did the same(kept plants operating) and we should ignore them but hate meat because Oliver says so? Nice job taking a significant stride towards the end game of completely veg. human animal population.
It's 2pm in India it's not tonight show for us 😂
I missed you.  Thank you for coming back
Excellent journalisticpiece .👍👍👍
Socialism looking pretty nice right now, don't you think? :)
1111th!
bruh
And it’s about the same here in Germany. The company Tönnies had the same issues. Immigrant workers, high COVID rate etc. Bad, very bad.
America system is broken in so many ways when one industry is controlled by a handful of powerful organization. Meatpacker, pharmaceutical, food industry...
If you think the stuff concerning meatpacking facilities are appallingly disgusting, just you what, 'cause I'm pretty sure the next thing that everyone is going to be consuming are Soylent Green wafers.
I seriously don’t understand how people cannot be vegan at this point. Corporate America is exploiting the most vulnerable on this planet and people still can give them their money and poison themselves to end up with diseases that guess who has the treatment to? CORPORATE AMERICA. they seriously don’t give a fuck about any form of life ,  WAKE UP.
govt. can fight the lawsuits of civilians with all their might but when it comes to corporations they use  .00003 % of their capability.
This is the only thing social media is good for.  With how neutered regulations have become, the only way to possibly get change is to shame them on social media, and shame them often.
Me, who was made to read Upton Sinclair's The Jungle in high school: Hey, I've seen this one before!  Edit: After watching the video all the way through, it's appalling and disheartening, but in no way surprising, that nothing has changed over the last 100-odd years.
Campaign Finance Reforms is the answer to all this, otherwise Tyson will continue buying off our politicians.
Glad I'm a vegetarian. If more of us were vegetarians , this wouldn't be an issue.
What a f-ing disgrace!  Will there ever be a situation where issues like these get solved and management of these companies get well-deserved punishment?! This show should be mandatory to be watched by the US gov!
Yes capitalism is good
welcome to capitalism
I had my Guinea Jacob and he passed after 8yrs,loved him so much.. With that said, WTF kinda commercial is that? Is Marijuana legal in the State Perdue is in because damn, he smoking the Ooowee!! 🤣🤣
Why isn't this already automated?
Yet another reason that capitalism is shit
Almost 116 years since The Jungle was published, and this is where we are.
what I'm getting from every new John Oliver's show and, frankly, every piece of news is that the US is evil and needs to be stopped
LUKSO (LYXe) Coin 🚀 🚀
When you choose money over everything else, everything else goes to hell.
Why tf does it cost over 15,000 dollars to pull off one funeral?!?! Are they giving away gold to the guests or something?!?!
I wonder how many people actually reconsider their meat consumption after this. The abhorrent working conditions are only the tip of the ice berg when it comes to reasons why we should move away from the levels of meat we are consuming.
Why ur eyes so puffy. Is ur marriage ok lol
Jokes on you, I only buy from my local butcher. I get to treat my meat packer like shit in person.
I mean the family guy is in charge of chicken…not pork…but go on…
If a CEO or president of a company says he considers his workers family. I automatically assume they're being treated horribly.
Oh look, it's episode 8732 of why the US is a total mess and dick over the common people. Not in a million years would I move there.
And what's even more amazing is we didn't even begin talking about how the animals are treated.
Go vegan... ... for the animals  ... for the planet  .... for your health  ... for the people
I would like to criticize China for inhumane conditions in workplaces, but Americans are making it a lot harder for me by doing exactly the same shit.
Upton Sinclair tried to tell us this already
With this segment and the one on pandemics, it sounds like eating less meat would be a pretty good idea to lower the demand for it and save lives.
This industri is evil in every way possible
Sad what ur show turns to without trump. Lol ur lack of making fun of biden. Lol making fun of meat now lol good luck chump bucket
People who get upset over this video should know how John Oliver operates. This is a comedy show. They are under no obligation to give this thing a fair shake or present anything even remotely close to the truth. The writers of this show have a tendency dramatize things completely out of proportion - all for your entertainment.   Meatpacking is hard work. Duh. But if you reported about it in the above fashion you could make something like roofing look like attempted genocide. This is stupid and it works for anything. You focus on the bad stuff, exaggerate it, gin up hate against the 'others', and ready is your emotional response. You will always find people who have been wronged in some way as well as people complaining, completely regardless of the industry. The hardships that are endured in meatpacking are absolutely normal in physical labor and are by no means US-specific.
John Oliver is basically; Why you should be radicalized, tonight:
Thst moment your local channel is on a national show for mindfucked reasons.....
How are we still basically in The Jungle? I thought we all read that book and said yeah this is wrong and the suffering meat packers go through is heartbreaking and infuriating IN THE 1890S
When you see such stories and see what the harsh reality is and Americans still have the audacity to call their country "the greatest country in the world" and their presidents "most powerful man on earth" GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE. What a terrible bunch.
I used to work for Amazon and the simularities are honestly not shocking at all 😕
280 died of 57,000 who tested positive? That’s...not that as bad as I thought it would be. And considering we don’t know their ages or health situation, I don’t know how to feel,...eeeh?
...and here I was, thinking today's episode would be about the situation in Texas. I'm surprised, but not quite pleasantly so.
The American dream right there folks. If immigrants only knew what kind of shit awaits for them in the land of the free. Go to Europe where this kind of things are punishable with prison time. If this kind of shit would happen in a EU factory the unions would rip these assholes apart. Not only that...but this kind of behavior is actually illegal.
Another extreme capitalism that make socialist resentment very hi!
This is America!
Take away the demand by going plant based. We each have personal responsibility as to the consumer choices we make. These places wouldn’t exist if we simply didn’t buy their cruel product. That’s the lesson we refuse to learn.
With the fact that I haven’t watched this yet in mind, didn’t sinclear do this segment a century ago‽
"It is futile to speak of liberty as long as economic slavery exists."
this applies to factories that build machinery or factories that do plastic forming / extruding.
Gawddamn.
And that's how u use namaste to insult someone 👍👍. Well done John.
Welp Fedex writes you up for injuries...
and old people wonder why young people love socialism... this country is so fucking disguisting. i dont know what to do about this shit other than harangue my elected reps about it, which im sure will be ineffective. but i'll do it.
Finally. We can get back old school pre-trump jhon. trump era jhon was SO annoying.
2:26 but not Jack Nicholson
JBS in my hometown in Utah got like 1/3 of the floor employees sick with covid and refused to close
I worked for a local food chain as a meat department "butcher", they actually threatened to write me up for cleaning the meat grinder too much... according to their training and regulations, any time a new product is going to be grinded up, we needed to fully clean it to prevent cross contamination. My department manager yelled at me for cleaning it between different batches of ground beef.... He only really pushed for cleaning if the meat color changed (Red to white or reverse). I quit after I reported this and a few other cleaning/health issues, and was told by the stores head managers that I was to do exactly as told by the meat manager.  2nd story... quit 7-11 when they threatened to fire me for refusing to cook frozen chicken tenders: that they let thaw on a counter for 5 hours. (to this day I will never eat 7-11 cooked foods.)  Honestly I'm just ranting because I can't recall in near a dozen food based jobs... I never once got praise for tossing bad food or calling out bad practices... I just became the enemy...  (next time you are allowed in a fast food place when you get food: watch how gloves are rendered near useless almost every time... they are used to clean and cook without changing them. they are used to touch cloths and skin and not changed after... the one I see most is putting their gloves on the counters/walls/ledges between food items and not swapping them out... The best way to kill your apatite is sitting by the bathroom and noticing how often employees go in and end with a flush but no use of the sink...) so rule in fast food... ignorance is bliss...
Hello 2025 !!!!!
I think fines should be in % not just $
what incredibly niche information will i learn tonight
So John Oliver is now trying really hard to become the next Upton Sinclair?
In germany the first amendment of the constitution says: "Human dignity shall be inviolable. ..."   I think this this right is more important than the right to bear arms.  I would rather see people be treated with respect and dignity than to see them carrying weapons around.  I hope America will change to the better.
Im very glad i dont live in america
I have quit buying any Tyson products because of how they dealt with the pandemic and their employees.
This is a threat
😞
Any republicans have an opinion on John using CNN as a source? Just curious
*Man this is brutal...* It makes sense for there not to be a real audience anymore given the pandemic but I think this version of the show could really benefit from a laugh track.
I’m 2 years Vegan. I changed because I wanted to prevent from having allergic reactions. I can’t have dairy without being a water hose, certain meats cause nausea, seafood is a ticket to the ER, and I was curious on how my health would be affected under closer observation. Yes, I do check ups with my PCP for deficiencies, thus far, I’m healthy and pursuing bodybuilding.
I'm coming to bake your beans Oliver
John Oliver is the hero we desperately need but honestly do not deserve!
"Nobody should be treated like a machine." If the paradigm of the meat business is to breed and raise living, breathing animals to kill them unnecessarily with no consideration that falls beyond the interest of the dollar, well, the are your baseline morals for the whole shebang. Money is more important than life and it's definitely more important than quality of life. See? People and other animals really aren't that different. Shut it down and get those folks into a vertical farm.
Workers already have "the right to socially distance" it comes as a package with your human rights (if the workers are indeed human), the problem is the USA using excuses not to inforce said human rights.
I'll take these stories and work on them everyday after going through all that MAGA QANON bull cr@p
Fun fact, I work in a warehouse that comes in contact with Tyson meats. And this episode makes me want to wear extra gloves! Feal for the workers.
Don't think of Americans as people, think of us as resources to be exploited and the country makes a lot more sense.
I love this show, but after all this time, how many of his pleas for our system to do better been heard? How much change has our awareness caused the system to change. Our system is rigidly against any form of radical change that is necessary. We need to dismantle the system and take the means for our lives and safety back from those who seek to exploit us. We need to bring everyone to the same level and we need to do it now.
1. Employ helpless people 2. Subvert the system 3. Blindside morality 4. Profit
Watching this as I’m munching on a t-bone at midnight
Feels good to be vegetarian after these videos
14:23
So for anyone that's can manage to be objectionable, a big chunk of this episode will make a lot more sense when you realize at least Tyson (though I am sure more than just them), will actually go down south of the border and round up workers. Bring them back to a plant and get away with under cutting the native employees. Ibp, a company that Tyson bought out did this for decades including sourcing refugees from africa. They don't expect them to maintain work visas or anything like that. They also know that because such a percentage of their employees are undocumented, they can get away with all of this that John mentioned. They lobby to relax immigration laws to increase profits at the expense of the families that have had roots in these small towns like John mentioned. When immigration would show up they would allow them to take away one or two of them so that it appears immigration is doing something and keeps the plant on the government's good side. Flame me if you like but if want to stop the overwhelming majority of what John mentioned in this video, that's the root cause
Really thought in the food chain bit he was gunna do an Adam Driver joke
Here i thought meatpacking in germany would be near slavery. I forgot the united states always want to be on top of every list.
John Oliver = Hot
Baked beans ;(
It's no surprise that an industry based on exploitation of sentient beings would exploitation their employees.
Upton Sinclair would probably be pretty disappointed, but not likely surprised, by the fact that we're living in another Gilded Age of industrial horrors.
Baked beans :)
*baked beans?
....and this is exactly the places all these caravans are going to end up. All the sick or aging employees are going to be replaced by these desperate folks at a fraction of the price! The race to the bottom is becoming bottomless!
Baked beans)
Well, let's hope someone from the Biden White House watches this and gets to work to strengthen OSHA.
BAKED BEANS
Zen John Oliver? What alt universe is this?!
BAKED BEANS
Ok going vegan for some years prob forever brb
Johnny English at it again
We actually had a similar incident in meatpacking in Germany last year. Not with literal bets, but with a highly localised outbreak nonetheless. The cries for changes were loud, but I don't know how much actually happened.
4:31 funniest thing yet!!!
The United States is so screwed up these Shady companies are not helping these people, the fact that if you so much as use the toilet you will be fired just wow 🤦😡  But on a side note George Zimmerman is a douche and always will be 💯
Ah yes... with all the laid back regulations and tax exemptions for these companies, people are still waiting for that wealth to trickle down.  Any day now.
You can only like this comment if you're in the first 1000 viewers
I found out about this channel with John Oliver after binchwatching community. What happend John?..
People don't care about any of this. They just want their cheap daily meat. Even ignoring the suffering of the animals, which most people really don't care about, there have been so many scandals in the meat industry and nothing happens. No outrage. People keep on buying cheap meat every single day.
we should either automate it or go vegan
Alright everyone! You heard the Man! miss Piggy Sex Taape!!!!
God damn this is depressing. There are so many exploited people
Ha ha that was the dumbest fucking commercial I’ve ever seen ha ha
John Oliver  is a major must watch !
I have a guinea pig exactly like that, I cannot wait for my family's reaction
Jesus, Mr Pilgrim is ugly as hell
I went to school for Zoology and had to read Slaughterhouse Blues in my cultural anthropology class, which shed light on treatment of employees in industrialized meat production and how the job affected their livelihood. Technically it's an outdated resource at this point but still worth the read if you want do look more into this topic. Truly disturbing.
Sounds like plant-based burgers aren't just more ethical from a farm animal's perspective....
they abolished unions and sold the lie to the working class that unions are stealing their money in order to prevent any legal representation for the employees. factories and production plants are moving to states that have no union representation or are moving overseas, just so they can treat people like cogs.
I'll always be thankful to live in a little village in Italy in which there's a butcher that raises his own animals so close to my house that I can actually see them, alive and eating grass, if I look carefully from my second floor window
I'm betting those managers (and corporate workers) get enough time to go to the bathroom... not to mention can go to their own doctor...   Must be nice to be able to do that at your job. Seems like everyone in the company should be able to do that, don't you think?
Why don't they unionise and go on strike until they are offered better working conditions. Isn't this the reason unions exist?
Domo arigato, Oliver-sama.
cancel the meat industry all together
It is very sad to recognize that America is not a wonder as we see in the movies. The richest nation in the world with so many poor and miserable. The country that is the guardian of justice if and only if you have a lot of money, as the public defender will only propose an agreement with the prosecutors so that you will only be in prison for a while even if you are innocent. Where fervent Christians do not know compassion. Where the black man learns as a child to bow his head to the police who should protect them. Where everything is dual: winners and losers, white collar and blue collar; white and colored. Where people do not know how to locate their own country on the globe, perhaps because the globe is not flat.
Meatpacking is never a great job, last year there outbreaks of Covid in German meatpacking plants as well and they had the same argument, they got infected outside work. Most were /are workers from poorer EU countries like Romania. Living crammed in houses provided by the company. The working conditions are not great, but as far as I know, safer than what we saw here. But they are far from good. Another reason, that I stopped eating meat 25 years ago. I hope, there will be a change. It should not be such a dangerous job!
Late-stage capitalism at it again, I see.
They are just meat industry version of sweatshops
Kind of surprised they haven't covered 1/6/21 yet
There where similar outbreak’s in Germany in meat factories. Tönnies being just one of them. They had to shut down for a while and the entire surrounding area became a massive covid hotspot.
"It's one of the many reasons I have no interest in watching Miss Piggy's sex tape." Is another reason that, over on the Late Show, John got Miss Piggy on a "Which Muppet are you?" test? I know I'd feel weird watching porn of someone I apparently am basically identical to.
16:23   "Yeah exactly"  ANY POLITICIAN WORTH THEIR SALT! FIX THIS!
Hello ghoulish robber barons! Congratulations, you’ve dragged us back to Upton Sinclair’s “The Jungle,” yet again.
If a company claims it treats workers like family, run like hell.
I can see a protest movement forming with the slogan the right to pee. Get all the factory and distribution workers like  Amazon on this. These people are treated the same way as the food they process or the boxes they sent. This is meant to show the ridiculousness of the problems faced by these fellow humans, fellow citizens, working people, concious beings.
It seems more and more clear that the US economy devours its workers in favour of even more profits. This example here is not the only one and it won't be the last. I'm wondering how long people are willing to take this as "normal" and not revolt...
To just keep your head above water from the despair of living in a failed state because the greed of millionaires and billionaires. We got our priorities so wrong. They need to be taxed out of existence. We need more unions. We have to do it together people. There’s more of us than them. Come together. Support unions and your fellow workers. We have strength in numbers. We must learn our strengths is in ourselves in solidarity. 💙
It's been very well known everywhere I've worked that if you try to get worker's comp, they're going to magically find a reason to fire you.
Biden's immigration plan would ensure non-citizen workers won't complain about wearing a diaper to work. Hooray.
Your poor arm hurts what the hell do you want everyone hurts all the time company nurses do plenty
employers are scum. so glad i smarted my way out of the work force.
there's nothing better then listening to john explaining how usa is a dystopia while being on the other side of the earth
should we bet which company is next?
Go vegan! Or go hunt your own meat :)
I fucking HATE when companies say that their employees are "like family". Like, no bitch, you're my boss and I'm here to do a job. Pay me a living wage AT LEAST and when my 8 hours are up let me go home and DON'T CALL ME! Yes, I am jaded.
You guys had to digitally alter Pilgrim's face to be smaller on his head.  I refuse to believe he looks like that.
For more information on these issues, I highly recommend "Fast Food Nation." Great book.
Ah, time for this year's lawsuit, I bet.
Companies should be legally required to pay for the medical costs of all work related medical bills.
Monday is THE day of the week for me, just because of Oliver.
I know Covid is a crucial news for a year now, but I am glad he's not talking about Covid this time.
I was extremely hyped seeing it was about meatpacking but it wasn't what I hoped for😢
Please, there's no way to flip the blame for the guy peeing under the production line onto anyone else. John sometimes really stretches his outrage
For as long as lobbying exist, law makers will work for the source of the money.  There's a reason why it's illegal in many countries, and it's called bribery.
Frick yeah Zazu’s back
I was expecting that hamster ad be something from PETA.  By the way, every time a human eats PETA makes money off of animal abuse.
Honestly I did not think that AD would end like this
Another reason to stop eating meat. Everybody suffers in meat production. The people, the animals, the environment und the consumers health
As someone working in a chicken meat processing factory in Germany this felt personal Now I admit the conditions aren't as bad as in America (rarely nothing ever is) but its getting there And I really fear that with the ongoing March of the neoliberal plague it will be one day
This BS is EXACTLY why UNIONS were started back in the day. The gov is dropping the ball to protect American workers, so bring the Unions back.
The whole US is fucked up. This country bends to the rich and the government organizations that were there to protect the people, the corrupt bring them down. And then the people stop caring about these protections because it's the new norm and people feel powerless. This country needs to change. Enough is enough. I've dealt with OSHA and have no issues with them. We need to modernize just like most of the world has done or is doing. We are just stuck in the past.
The scene with the peacocks and the owl.... Cluckolding
I couldn't even watch through the very beginning of the episode without bursting out loud laughing xD Oh my that commercial was hilarious  EDIT: Finished the rest of the video and I'm just left feeling disgusted at these meat companies...
Hmm... so instead of protein from meat, I wonder if I can mash beans and use them in a sandwich.
The USA love their second-class citizens, or whatever you want to call 21th-century slaves.
Feckless Capitalism.
Oh no some dudes took bets on a completely random BS ... I ve been in meat packing for thirty years ... John Oliver is an idiot a fascist Tool nothing more. Some guy took a piss and got fired oh no. Go work south of the border the talk shit.
Warning, if you're eating while watching, finish your food 1st
Hm that is capitalism. Maybe there is a way to change stuff. And if your first response is "so you want communism!!!" You are part of the problem.
Just stop eat meat. The workers get jobs in crop farming.
Never trust any employer who says the company is a family... They are the kind of family that exploits and humiliates you.
Aw, that report was when we only had a quarter million deaths.
Tyson is an Adam's family
What bothers me about this segment is that John Oliver doesn't even mention that what what we can do is reduce our meat consumption. Why is he ignoring the one thing each one of us can change?
How much crack was involved in making an ad with a rabid hamster biting a dog in the arse?
Wage labor is a step up from slavery and needs to be abolished.
The European Union has laws that makes these sort of working conditions illegal and, indeed, unthinkable.  That's why Britain's billionaires wanted to get out, so that they can be more like America. They called it "getting rid of red tape".
Are most problems to do with greed?
Nah ... We need that chicken 2 cents cheaper now go and put your back into it and you can cut it in 1 second.
HG Wells’ vision of the future from the time machine boom is pretty much what being a worker is like in America. Some dirty beasts who live below all the elites. And we even treat each other this way. One poor worker beast goes to another store and acts like their shit don’t stink and the poor workers of that store are garbage compared to them. This is how we treat each other and how elites treat us. We always find the little things that separate ourselves from the collective horde and lord it over the rest like we’re special because of it, when the reality is that we are all garbage people for the rich to throw away whenever they feel like it.
US sucks, really.
OSHA is a joke anyway.
Meat comes from the cadaver of someone who wanted to live. The *best* thing you can do, the most positive action that you can make in your life is to become Vegan. Being Vegan embodies non-violence, and renounces the oppression of all beings including non-human animals. For example: pigs, chickens, cows and fish commonly used and killed for “food.”  When you get to know them, you recognize animals have feelings and are sensitive individuals. Just like you, as well as your dog and cat companions. Being Vegan represents a new moral baseline *rejecting* violence and animal use for pleasure, amusement or convenience.  Please watch Vegan Video, a 12 minute feature, which shares the logic and ease of being Vegan.  After viewing this thought provoking material, please consider becoming Vegan.  Thank you for your time and consideration: WatchVegan.Video
I've been watching old episodes lately at work and watching the stress of the last year take a toll on John, I think we've all gone grey up top giving the circumstances. We love ya Johnny boy!!! Keep up the phenomenal work!
So... US... How are your doing Buddy? Perhaps is time to start coping the European way of living. Yes it's more expensive than your way of living but beter workers rights, beter healthcare, beter animal standards, beter roads, beter... Just pay more taxes.
Republican wonderland.
How many of you commenters have actually stayed home? I bet most of you are going to eat indoors at restaurants now - even though you could just as easily get curbside pickup
This country sucks!
Meat is simply too cheap in the US. I live in The Netherlands where it's hard to find boneless chicken breast below $4/lb when it's not on sale. In the US it's easily below half that price, looking at Walmart Grocery, the first item listed for boneless chicken breast is $1.78/lb. It's simply not possible to produce meat at these prices without cutting every possible corner.
Not even 7 minutes and I'm about to barf. Today will be Veggie Day.
side note on Tyson, about half of the line workers are not even employed by Tyson directly but by Temp agencies.
take your 'here-before-a-million-views' ticket here
I hope Joe Biden is looking this!
To be fair to Tyson, they didn't say what kind of family they are. Most people don't like their families so they aren't exactly wrong. The Trump's are a family too
Truly depressing. Thanks John!
No wonder it's so cheap to own a home or rent in texas. It's almost a death sentence to live there
Truth be told in some way most factory jobs are not much better about the bathroom breaks. One job i worked at out in michigan i was part of a group of 14 people brought in for second shift. After 90 days i was let go and 12 other people who i came in with had been gone for a few months before that. Also that last guy had maybe a 10% chance of even getting hired on as well. Oh also some factorys have even been well know to force religious veiws on to its empolys like a mandatory pray time each and every shift.
I work at UPS and ya much the same there too but none of this will ever change cause  1. U are an entry-level job that will soon be replaced by a machine  2. The fines are less then shutting down to rebuild a plant 3. All those added costs will drip down onto consumers So unless u won't to spend $15 a lb for chicken thems the breaks. Can't scare kids into getting good jobs without bad ones
That betting pool sounds bad until you walk outside and see people TRYING to get sick and spread it
Just dislike without watching.
Well hopefully these issues get fixed now that some light has been shed on them.
The more and more I age, and the more and more I experience new things and learn new things the more and more I feel kind of hopeless and helpless.   It isn’t just LWT w/ John, it’s the news and the world around us. If you aren’t born with the right skin color/right socioeconomic status the more and more you’re just fucked. Just flat out fucked.   All of us can agree, “those poor workers” but we all can’t do anything because a lot of us are drowning ourselves and the voting booths seem fruitless now because the majority of us live in places gerry-mandered/voter suppressed to shit so our voices and wants aren’t heard.  Come on Comet 2024: End it All  - a 27 year old who feels like she’s 72
I've personally worked in two different meat plants. one a moderately local thing, with a few related branches and businesses in the area, all owned by a local bigshot whom I've personally met several times. the other under the umbrella of a huge multinational type thing. and while not immune from a lot of the above problems, it's more than worth noting that the smaller one always, and I do mean always, had government inspectors roaming freely around. and other than thinking that the people there really need a raise, I would describe it as a decent job.... the other place... fuck that place, I literally walked out after three weeks
We will truly be a 3rd world country if we don't say or do anything about this ......
Please do one on farmers' protest in india
How come work-conditions in a factory in what is supposed to be 'the greatest country in the world' are on par with a third world country?
this is what happens when one country thinks they are the best country in the whole world.
John for 2024
Surprise! Capitalism kills
Tyson's is a  family! However Tyson's Factory workers are the Meg of the family. 😐
Yes, been waiting on OSHA covid regulations for a while. Working in the service industry has been very stressful. Especially when you live in a red state.
Huge fan of this show, have been for many years because of the attention to detail. But at 14:45 its talking about poultry an showing pictures of beef, ground and cut varieties. 🤔 your better than that John.
i feel like no one's going to watch this bc they think it's about animal cruelty that they are actively contributing to.
Bo Pilgrim looks like a genderbent version of Frau Engel from Wolfenstein 2. Chicken Nazi?
How much people from India is watching it 😎😎😎😎😎👍👍👍👇👇👇👍👍👍
Hey John! Love your work. Can you please do Modi and India part 2. Things are getting worse here every day. Authoritarianism on a rise, minority suppression, killing of dissent. Hopefully you covering it would bring it to limelight, globally.
What's wrong with a betting pool on how many employees get covid-19 when wall street and insurance companies do the same, and we don't bat an eye?
Finally... Here it is. Hi John I'm ready
John Oliver: The Modern Muckraker.
Not even three minutes in and my state is already being mentioned.
Many warehousing jobs are also going this sort of way, treating employees more and more like machines and numbers. Since Amazon came on the scene it's gotten a lot worse. Always pushing people to the brink to make investors that extra one-thousandth of a cent. I've seen folks who have worked for the same company for 15-20 years making good money finally call it quits because they're just pushing people too hard.   It used to be that you could do good work and do well, those days seem to be gone.
I may not work with meat but I work at a packaging plant for Pepperidge Farm. We are now working 10-hour shifts almost every single day. We do try social distancing but there are moments where people are too close and even the people in charge of the lines don’t care. And to make things worse, we don’t know if we get a day off or not because the damn schedule keeps changing. Everyone’s days off get taken away.
Man am I glad that I don't live in such a shithole country...
Whenever a company describes its employees as “family,” you know something’s up. Edit: https://youtube.com/shorts/4vqTcNHpqK4
Once you say, “we are like family,” I am running away.
Thank God I am vegan; reduce, reuse, recycle.  I refuse to be part of the problem.
I gotta be honest, its nice to be worried about something other than viruses for the first time in a while.
Freaks me out that most of the chicken I’ve eaten in my life come from places like this... especially because theyre delicious
This show works so much better without the audience.
He peed like it wasn’t the first time!
So if the meat industry is a problem because the rich are corrupting it, the solution seems simple; eat the rich
Once again, capitalism without rules destroying humans
Oh, they changed the logo!
I would be ok with a death penalty for everyone involved on the managerial level for forcing humans through such conditions. Or at least life in prison. I can't believe some of the workers didn't snap and kill some of the managers, even prison seems like a better place than working under such conditions holy shit
Time to buy some tyson shorts 😤
I have seen every Last Week Tonight episode and each time I finish a show my heart sinks a little more. 😔 You guys at LWT do great and important work trying to inform us about the least of us in society. Thank you. 🙂
Thier nurse is worse than any nurse is school thats scary
So dame judi Dench is this season's Adam driver, eh?
What, behind the guinea pig?  -It IS the guinea pig!
Same premise as the chicken episode really; we talk a lit about one aspect, but we really should be talking about the people being involved at the bottom level as well
Jesus christ...even more of a reason for me to be glad that I went vegetarian. Fuck the meat industry.
Capitalistic Dystopia, feels like something out of orwell or huxley. Are we still in the 19th century?
Uptown Sinclair wrote The Jungle in 1906 and a 115 years later we’re still dealing with BULLSHIT from the meat packing industry. I FUCKING HATE HOW NASTY PEOPLE ARE and it’s almost exclusively people with money.
Capitalism is the new slavery.  Corporations like Tyson, Walmart and Amazon are the masters.  The only difference is, nowadays, they pay small amount in wages for the "employee" to get their own housing, clothing and food.  The Emancipation Proclamation means nothing to those in charge.
damn, not even a joke at the end, this ones just depressing really
"Industrial revolution" = robots fucking slaves. Which is funny cause I believe in robots. I just fail to see why the invention of endless perfect labor is making things worse in the world. The SYSTEM as usual. Trillionaires and Trump. The worst things ever. Use up the slaves and then insult them on your way out the door.
I lost it at the middle agressive pigeon.
After watching this i was stated heating with America 🤮🤮🤮    I love my india a lot 🥰🥰🥰🥰
You need to Do a story on Disneyland safety for guest and cast members its a nightmare
How does John "knowing" his ugly make him attractive
Thank you for addressing this, most people only mention the animal aspect but no one ever talks about how terrible and unsafe the conditions are for the humans and both conversations are important
WAGER ON HUMAN LIFE???? sounds kind of like the Republicans party
now picture how this kind of facility runs in a 3rd world country.
Meatpacking in America is 05:10
Anyone else get monty python vibes from that guinea pig?
imagine having workers rights XD
We all need to go vegetarian until all this changes
It's concerning that the nurse from the meat packing plant reminded me of my high school's nurse
Whenever boss says that his company is like family then you can be sure they have issues.
and this is why im a vegetarian
The more I learn about working here in the US the more I'm sure we actually need way less office workers than we have, and way more blue collar jobs, with wayyy better pay and workers rights. Automation has attached itself to and made office style work far more efficient more so than it has for blue collar jobs. We need nurses and cleaners and factory workers and people who can do detailed works and thought and decision making, not digital file movers.
All that comes to mind is some American President talking about "Shithole Countries". If only I would recall the whole thing...
Imma gonna be late from Tyson first shift tomorrow morning, gotta love this show
Nice, America is becoming China :D The real Murican dream... cheers!
Hey, John? HBO?  You realize that the conditions that you're reporting on here are the same as your WWE episode, right? And your RV episode? And your medical debt episode?  IT'S CAPITALISM. THIS IS THE FAULT OF CAPITALISM.  Capitalism is an inherently exploitative economic system. There's no fixing it or rehabilitating it.
Didn't even mention the time a pork line was being run so fast that aerosolized pig brains breathed in by employees gave them all bizarre nerve problems as their immune system decided that nerve cells were foreign and needed to be attacked.
I remember my dad who drove trucks telling me he picked up at a Tyson plant and he was hard pressed to find anyone that spoke English. It’s ironic so many Americans hate immigrants but immigrants are the backbone of our meat and farming industries. 🤦🏾‍♂️
It’s pretty disgusting to call any factory a family
Everything wrong with Amerikkka directly correlates to white supremacy and the practitioners of this demonic ideologies inability to look after the wellbeing of EVERYONE.
Land of the free?
Thank you for highlighting this issue John. Remember though, we are also culpable for continuing to give them custom.  On a lighter note, you can be self deprecating all you want but be nice to miss Piggy! :) :)
He had to sign with the pen in his mouth. Land of opportunity, huh?
I know this is not the point, but what is up with the guy not calling in sick once in 30 years? He handled food and certainly has been sick some time during those 30 years. Do yall want another pandemic over there?
I work at one of these plants. I can't say anything due to a privacy contact. I am afraid that if the minimum wage raises to $15 my plant will close and I will be looking for another job.
Republican philosophy: No regulations =no accountability 😈
How many animals have their throats slit and  die bleeding and screaming.. boo fucking how about some smuck having a bad day . If you people don’t like this  -  stop eating animal corpses. And Jon Oliver - once in your life shitty reporting- it’s not “ meat packing “ it’s murdering of millions of animals .
8:15 OH so that's why Amazon has a first aid station at their warehouses. HA
Notice how corporatists have to cover their asses, too, that was literally the gun that killed Treyvon Martin. Enough of that pussyfooting gun allegedly used in fatal shooting lol so not funny. Thanks for enlightening and ruining my evening as usual, John. Love
Murica ;)
republicans: "immigrants taking our jobs"..not mentioning most take these type of jobs
How timely, I was just having a shouting match yesterday about how "low skill" labor isn't low skill at all, and is in fact necessary for our society to exist, so you can't simply sweep peoples lives under the rug, and they need to be paid what is necessary to survive. Then good ol Johnny O drops in with, "I bet you don't know how horrifying this industry is" I in fact, did not.  I was also talking about eating the rich... any chance we could send them down the line? at a much slower pace of course, worker safety is important.
This is beyond depressing!
Wtf is Jim insinuating? To eat the murderous psychopathic guinea pig?
When we had our covid meat plant scandal in Germany I thought things were bad already but somehow the USA still manages to take the cup
So... These kinds of humans matter now huh💸😒💀 you sure take your time giving anything white a hand out until it's late.
John Oliver: "If you ate meat today..."  Me, currently shoving chicky nuggies into my face: "..... I'm scared but continue."
I hate how most jobs are like this in different ways. No one should be in charge of another human being, it always ends horribly.
No college degree with union benefits most of the time, decent benefits, 8/1500 die to a mild flu... I'm not seeing much of an argument why a business should kneel in front of the left on this.  Your move Oliver
number one way to know you are considered a useless peon is when the business calls you family
PER-FUCKING-DUE DAMNIT.
Apart from the big guns used to steal resources from poor countries, what’s really great about America again???
This show made me fall in love with my "third world" country
I love u
Welcome to this week's episode of "How huge corporations are screwing up America."
Guinea Pig is a highly sought after delicacy in many locals.. ("pig" should be a clue).. and, never ever eat a chicken you didn't raise.. they're antibiotic sinks, and chock full of chemicals (I used to mix their feed).
Working in the same company, but treated so differently.
Perfect example of why there are no jobs in this country.  You cant pander to the "job creators" myth. It never works. Ever.
Just how many times John starts the show with "the industry is controled by these (2 - 4) companies".
The meat packing employees are just meat. So sad. Along with the crap they have to deal with with OSHA and any other things they can go through OMG...
When will you finally make some material on Poland and Hungary? HBO leash does not reach that far?
Which Is a sh$t hole country now?
"I gagged in front of my child" killed me.
That’s what she said
The United Corporations of America.
America, "land of the free, home of the brave meatpacking workers".
Another problem is that in the federal government, there is more importance placed on defense than any other department
The problem with capitalism is that it glorifies greed. Profit becomes the only aim and people ignore many important things, like compassion towards fellow humans beings.
A company only gets big in this country by doing this kind of shit. If you treat your workers with dignity, you'll be outcompeted by those who don't. That's unregulated capitalism for ya.
By the way, Food Inc. featured at 7:08 is free on YouTube if you live in the United States. Get an adblocker if you're watching on a computer. Thank me later. (Oh and grab a barf bucket)
You want cheap meat, this is how you get it. Go vegan.
Eeee?? Lawsuits?
Gen Strike 2021, anybody?
S*** I'm not buying those Costco burgers again
I wondered if you were going to start with Upton Sinclair's Jungle. This has been an issue for a really long time. ._.
The previous Administration had little interest in focusing on worker rights--they were content to let the Big Corporations do their own thing.  It will take some time to change that mindset.  Unfortunately, the majority-minority workers in the meat-packing factories have very little political power.
Do you guys realize that this happens that most if not ALL factories experience these conditions ?  Veganism isn’t going to stop mistreatment in factories. They will just be exploited somewhere else 😶 . People that work in other factors are in the comments saying this happens to them to. The solution isn’t just to eat spinach and everything will be fine
Well, this is the reality of the American dream.
John Oliver is genuinely, authentically, whole-heartedly an unfunny immersion blender.
We need more people like you in the world. Kudos to you and your team.
Worker's compensation & FMLA (Family Medical Leave Act) should be "straightforward", but they're not. Similar to applying for SSD (Social Security Disability), it requires TONS of documents. And if EVERYTHING isn't properly filled out to a "T", then it'll continue to get denied. And unfortunately, they don't offer much help when you're trying to seek a resolution.  And they're all under STRICT DEADLINE.  FMLA, in particular, the dates that you need to put down is EXTRA IMPORTANT.  That's why many people obtain a legal counsel. (I was forced to learn, since I've been translating for my parents since I was 12yrs old. Lol)
Our world is a capitalist dystopian hellscape
What horrible atrocity hasn’t been done in American Capitalism?
I am now convinced that factories in America are run by Lucifer himself
Stop eating animals. People making profit off these animals' deaths don't give a rat's bottom about you, their workers and especially not the animals. Would you be ok with this processing system if it was dogs and cats being killed instead of cows,  pigs, chickens...?
"JBS, pagou o churrasco do PSL. PF7, primavera fascista, isso não é um teste. JBS, Jair Bolsonaro safado, conhece?"
man fuck em
Thanks to Mojo Nixon, I know all about the chicken plant in Hamlet, NC in 1991 where 25 people died in a fire because the owners locked all the fire exits.
Dude peed under the chicken and went right back at it. No. No. No!!!!
I’ve seen lots of reports about Amazon workers being treated just as terribly and yet as consumers we just disregard the facts and spend and spend‼️🤬🤦‍♀️
And yet osha can destroy small businesses just by showing up at a construction job site.
Anyone know where I can get me one of them fowl sex paintings?!?  Talk about hot
President Trump signed an executive order compelling meat processors to remain open to head off shortages in the nation’s food supply chains, despite mounting reports of plant worker deaths due to covid-19.  Worker safety experts say such an order would prevent local health officials from ordering meat companies to use their most effective weapon available to protect their employees from the coronavirus — closures.  The Washington Post/ Taylor Telford, Kimberly Kindy, and Jacob Bogage April 29, 2020 at 12:52 p.m. EDT
Ah finally another episode on "How UScapitalism is basically slavery with extra steps"...
I'd swipe left on John Oliver too 😏
35,812 views  37 minutes
Fuck Greeley Colorado! I lived there. It’s a garbage city
i just noticed that they changed their icon for their channel
Upton Synclair to John Oliver. The topic of meat production is an endemic issue with no end in sight.
Wtf america
So who won the betting pool?  And was the reward free meat for a year?
Put a box on their head to prevent them from seeing criminal behavior around them? What is this, Skyrim?
Why are you bringing up statistics to provoke people over racial lines? The physically requiring jobs being dominated by blacks/hispanics is completely in line with educational levels and merits. Got a problem with that? Then fix the factors and culture that leads to lower educational levels, instead of blaming things on systematic racism or white people, as insinuated.
It´s the same in Germany too. We just use poor east eurpeans to do the job ...
America: Third world hiding in first world clothes.
Coming from a girl who's worked in slaughterhouses for the last 15yrs,Thank you for this story. We work in terrible conditions, cold and wet all day with bare hands in ice and under running water. Once the leadman starts killing everyone works at breakneck speed until it's done, so that bathrm break thing doesn't surprise me. The company doesn't pay to heat the building in the VT winters. When company housing oil tank broke we were responsible for getting wood for the simple woodstove in the kitchen we depended on to heat the 8rm farmhouse from 1800s. When the water pipes busted they didn't fix it, we've been 3yrs now without water in the house. Sometimes they don't pay us and sometimes when they do, the checks bounce. A coworker got 2 fingertips ripped off in the plucker and they refused to help with his medical bills. They pay the leadman who's been there 30yrs less than $15/hr. This isn't even a corporation I worked for(finally left last yr), it's a "small family owned farm"; that's part of how they get ppl to put up with it. The owners use a combination of pretending they consider u family, making empty promises, and passive aggressive guilt-tripping to keep employees with low self-esteem working. They also refuse to pay unemployment and will fight you, I found that out when I left to avoid sexual harassment. I have a hundred horrifying examples that someday I'll expose. Meatpackers need a union!
Everyone is a victim.
I believe that guy about treating his employees like family. But then, I also believe he'd sell his grandma if it made him a buck...
Everyone on this piece are fat
"A huge share of this market in America is controlled by only a handful of companies." ...and you already know you're in some deep sh*t.
So the mortality rate for the meatpacking workers was just shy of half of one-percent.  Less than a regular flu outbreak.  People, wake up, the media like Last Week with John Oliver makes a living "creating" fear because it sells.  Not even four minutes into the video and they have already told me the whole clip is garbage.
Thank God, John Oliver is like 65% back to normal.
I'm here just eating my plants and wondering when the world will wake up. /smdh
this was all just a set up for the miss piggy joke
I bet John thanks his showerhead after he is done using it.
Those are the ones that should pay high taxes not the common worker.
I want someone to run for president on the platform that they will watch every John Oliver episode and then fix it.
US destroying their own country and dragging the entire world down with them..
When's the episode bout gamestop?
The hamster in this ad don't need spaghetti, it need the holy hand grenade.
We live in a nation where democrats would rather let 15,000 elderly die to avoid scrutiny for political reasons.
Why don't they make a union and occupy the fucking place?
India John : Farmer's Protest, Govt is an anarchy, fake news everywhere, the entire population of USA on roads, meat packing can wait. Talk about India John.
1500 cases and 8 deaths? That's a 0.53 death rate. Maybe a more realistic look at the death rate of covid than we have seen anywhere else? I can't help but notice that this year they have found a tiny fraction of flu cases compared to previous years, while covid is through the roof.
He have the same issue in germany
As a vegetarian and a Non American, I didn't really care for this issue after first 2 minutes but when he said that the man's funeral cost more than the company's fine, I literally got chills. The evils of capitalism know no bounds.
Holy shit. It's like things have barely improved since the industrial revolution. I wouldn't be surprised if an inspector was greeted at one of the plants by a soot-faced, sadly adorable Dickensian scamp: "'ello, Gov'nor! Just parcelin' up the chickens!" Seriously, what the fuck are we doing with the 21st century?
Im losing hope in this country.
Your country is disguisting.
Why do American companies treat their employees like trash
Unionize workers now!
America is too high on capitalism to see workers as humans.
Americas caste system. Ive worked in 2 factories. They dont give a crap about the employees. Then i worked for a non profit. They cared some. Not enough.
Please do India Farmer's Protest 😭😭😭😭
At this rate, someone could intentionally get shoved into a meat grinder and it probably wouldn’t wind up in so much as the batch of ground chicken getting thrown out.  You don’t have to be full-on vegetarian to stand up for the rights of animals and the people who process them. Just try to support your local, small-time businesses whenever possible.
My vegan breakfast tastes extra nice this morning 👌🏽
"At current staffing levels, [OSHA] would need 165 years to inspect each workplace..."  YIKES...Talk about extreme understaffing! WTF is OSHA good for then?
Disney takes out insurance policies on employees without really telling them essentially betting on which one of them will die that year
the jungle was written almost 116 years ago we haven't learned a fucking thing the story proved one thing slavery never went away it just changed shape when a industry treats a man like cattle he is no longer a man that is slavery in its purist form
The cruelty of the meat industry destroys both innocent animals and the people forced to handle them. Do your part and don't fund the industry with your purchases, eat some healthy food.
just don't eat the fucking meat
Damn.... of course it had to be Texas. 🤦🏽‍♀️
That's why I personally think, every lobby group, should be considered a mafia. The difference is minuscule.
Here in germany, its much of the same. Just put "Tönnies" into your favorite search engine. Major outbreaks of covid among immigrant workers hardly speaking any german, being put in isolated homes but forced to work in atrocious conditions to produce cheap meat.
Sadly, we have exactly the same problems with our meatpacking industry in Germany..
This was 92
Keep up the great work If your reading this checkout my indie Game Dev Channel I would truly appreciate your subscription
This reminds me of Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle" where workers were treated like shit but people were only in uproar *after* they realized the company's product was heavily effected by the company's profit motive. History loves to rhyme: worker exploitation is a company's jubilation.
I'm early.
Good to have you back Sir John....🖤💯🖤
When will John Oliver understand that the bourgeois state wont ever protect anything else than the profit of the capitalists, especially not workers. What we need isnt fucking OSHA, it,s workers, control over production and expropriation of the capitalist bastards who let workers die for their profits!
Well my mom had disability and got sued for social security..while she worked for general motors.....like wtf
Yet another reason to stop eating meat you filthy humans
That's just your beloved capitalism doing it's work. Keep hating socialism but you all will never solve those problems with stopping industries to give money to your senators.
homework <<< an episode of showing deep bleeding scars in our systems with british man who's old enough to be my dad... now homework... :)
America is just a big fucking joke
ok john doesn’t get how osha and workers comp works
John Oliver is the reason why I am still sane today...
And here I used to think that job auction scene in Bioshock Infinite was pretty dystopian.
Good reasons to seriously consider becoming vegan.   It's almost a miracle that thousands of people don't get dangerously ill on a daily basis.
What the, HIS FUNERAL COST MORE THAN 15K? What the fuck is wrong with USA?
algorithm
Thank you John Oliver, for uncovering the BS that goes on in these companies, which should be MORE regulated!!!  But that people either Do Not give a Flying Flock of birds .. Or, someone is getting paid under the table to look the other way... SMDH!!!
Ok Im kinda shocked here. First i thought LWT would indeed cover the meat factory industry and now the poor people packing the corpses are the poor ones Just stop eating that shit you goofballs xD Sry Im only 1:33 into the piece so maybe i adjust my commentary (not that anyone cares lol) Ok i watched it completely and of course my yeah working conditions are crazy in these low paying areas but it like that everywhere however in the meat industry you actually can do something about it and it is lowering your consume of meat and dont expect it to be so damn cheap so instead of crying for more OSHA inspectors start questioning your 1$ Burger people
It’s great to finally end the streak of “Coronavirus/Trump is shit” topics and go back to the old-school “Literally every industry in America is shit and lobbyists rule the country”
#LateStageCapitalism
The blue logo freak me out, don't know why
Automation is the only solution to please John Oliver
How the zombie apocalypse starts
If i saw John on bumble I'd swipe right so fast!
I've cut down my intake of meat, I won't touch pork and I mostly eat seafood. On occasion I will eat beef or chicken but probably once every 2 weeks for one meal.
Did anyone else think that John resembled the pervert owl watching  when he was talking about the peacocks screwing
guns and ammo
The only way factories, warehouses, and places like this will follow OSHA protocols is if an agent is there all day, everyday.
Three minutes I said holy shit before John
Go vegetarian. For the earth, for the animals, for yourself.
yeah but we should totally privatize everything tho
This confirms it, we are living in the Second Gilded Age. The Rich are getting richer and don't care a lick about the average person. Rober Barons are truly a thing once again. The Second Progressive Era is also upon us as a response, if only we had a modern day T. Roosevelt (or even a modern day FDR).
Thanks to the former administration;  the exploitation of meat workers got worse.
As an Australian this was weird to see. Alot of people here want to become meatpackers because the pay is considered to be pretty good.
Travyon Martin wasn't the innocent little angel that you, of course, once again, improperly suggested. He was an aggressive assaulter with a criminal record. What happened was appropriate. The only problem was that Zimmerman arguably shouldn't have taken the law into his own hands. He seems a bit psychopathic as well. But society is better off after what happened.
**Clutches MAGA hat harder**  But... but.... ma CAPITALISM!!! Wont somebody _PLEASE_ think of the Capitalism?!?
This is just absolutely disgusting.
Vegans : You monsters ! You should treat animals as well as you treat humans ! Meatpacking companies : Little did you know... We already do. 😏
And yet we complained about working conditions in China.
Hahaha. Fucking awesome. Im going to stay vegan so the meat packers don't jerk it into my chicken.
Yes, this is disgusting.  Anyways who's down for chicken nuggets or hot wings, I'm buying
And back to the cruel reality on the regular  basis
I can't say I'm familiar with that Judy person, so maybe my list, 3 would be replaced by my gaming computer, then yeah, that could be my list. 😉😂🤣
You know, countries which respect what unions are and do in order to fight for worker rights don't have this kind of issues.
Wow, I honestly thought the whole world knew about this.
6:12 Well that's pretty fucked up. Horrendous and just...wow... A nut job must be very happy with there purchase smh. All indeed, very fucked up.
To be fair America only knows death
To be fair America only knows death
Yet another reason to go Vegan. :/
John’s wife will be really happy about the family comments 😂
Meatpacking facilities are the greatest producer of corona virus in Germany. Good to see, it's the same in other countries, too.
Two weeks in a row, Oliver has asked "what can we do here?" And both times he avoided the obvious answer: boycott the industries killing us and go vegan.
Budgie smugglers are technically a type of meat packing...
And this is why I'm a vegatarian.
I'd like to put my computer to the most important list please
Never good when Greeley makes news
I've actually been to the giant Pilgrim head in person. And it's just as ridiculous as John makes it seem.
5:55-6:28 that run was awesome
Aaah 9am perfect time upload times for EU
usa nowadays looks like a capitalistc feudalist country. where the kings are companies that use their employees as servants. Just strike hard people.
I want to see an episode on DRM and GOG’s efforts against it.
🤷🤷🤷Cluckingham Palace?!🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
soup?
What the actual shit is that ad
Good to see that things in the meatpacking industry have changed very little since The Jungle was published. /s
I don't trust any head company men that say "we treat our employees as family" or "we are all family here" it usually means that company fucking hates their "family", bc that would be the only reason why they treat their "family members" like shit!
There’s no way they would ever slow down the meat industry. The fact is that America would rather work those people to death then have slightly more expensive meat.
With all due respect to Judi Dench(she's awesome), it's Betty White you bend your knee to now American. This should have been on the test.
This made my day 🤩
It's all same in every country. But.....only difference is...... We just speak in english 🤔🤔🤔🤔
It starts out like this, then somebody brings a weird orb from a foreign land, then A Machine for Pigs happens and everyone is like "How could this happen?"
Not gonna lie, that guinea pig gave me a good laugh
Yes yes yes yes yes yes
Good to see that the working conditions in the meat industry are shit outside of Germany, too
Eat less meat!
Well "at least" it's the same in every first world country. Germany has the same situation and  people are still supporting it by going for the cheapest, most disgusting packages of meat they can get.
*_"You had me at Meat Tornado,"_*_  — Ron Swanson_
That last time I was this early , the dodo was still alive
Sadly, but not surprisingly .000003% of the people whom have watched this segment won’t give a shit about the issue at hand. Working conditions, healthcare system, VA, infrastructure and, our education system is 3rd world at best. We are the most selfish people on earth. Yet we have the most churches per corner than any other country.
The local chicken plant is being investigated by the state, because they violated covid guidelines, falsified reports of covid number both death and infected. One guy died three days in, claimed he died in hospital and not in the plant, one woman lost two fingers still working there, one man got his foot taken by the meat grinder was forced to continue come in to work. One got stabbed in the hand and was not given immediate first aid because she was agency. They only pay the fines and continue.  Their sister company who does chicken paid out 100k to the family of a man who was decapitated because his shit got caught on a meat hook. they implemented mask wearing as well as face shield. Started free testing and pays for those who tested positive.   The turkey plant workers refuse to work in the chicken plant because they don't want to die and know the director of the bigger plant will make orders to drag unconscious or injured workers to the parking lot. Of they down right dont claim a dead worker does on route to hospital.
Ah yes, more evidence that America is a literal dystopia.
This company is closer to being a death cult for its factory workers than the self proclaimed family.
I hate being alive.
If you were fined by OSHA and had to pay 0.00003% of your yearly salary you would have to make ~$33,000 to owe just a single $0.01
1:18 "Those conditions are horrific, but they do get talked about a lot." - It doesn't seem to have an effect on the consumer or the legislation though.
Ah I forgot you're back. This was a pleasant suprise after my shower.
Who here remembers Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle"?  This is what happens when you ignore a problem for a century.
Pilgrims pride is some say you're a bigot without saying you are a bigot type branding
Namaste 🙏
Reminds me of the movie Modern Times
It is hard to justify my meat consumption seeing this.
Why don't you guys give us all of last years monologues.. or whatever the first part of ghe show is in a long video? That could be a thing.
I see John Oliver I click
John Oliver could make a video about how I won’t pay off my med student loans until I’m 95.  I would still be here watching it at 1:55AM.
Unions are starting so sound pretty good now, aren't they?
Breaking news: Water is wet
That Bo Pilgrim guy is already looking like a Resident Evil villain, but on top of that he has a mansion that looks like it was ripped straight from a RE game. Wouldn't surprise me if he has a secret underground lab underneath the building where he performs numerous experiments of unspeakable nature on... chicken.
Where my germans at, starting the video and already thinking about Tönnies?
Letsss gooo
tyson "we beat our meat against a wall" foods
What I have learned from this show is, that if the company claims their clients or workers are like family it means they are actually fucked.
Maybe we should eat less meat? Just maybe.
Great job.bigfan ☆☆☆☆☆
Things are so wrong with America.  Btw, every piece of meat has traces of poop in it, that's a fact.
Just another reason to be vegan
Ahhh America... The Late Stage Capitalist Hellhole. Please stop spreading your cancerous greed everywhere.
Our company is like a family. I am Josef Fritzl and the workers are my kid.
Normaly I would make a snarky comment about how much better the conditions in Europe are, but ... Tönnies.
Unionize, yesterday!
America, the third world country with gucci belt that believes they're the greatest country on earth that ever existed.
Man poor cows and pigs and poor workers...being abused by they're bosses and poor work conditions no one should suffer like that!
Capitalism, ladies and gentlemen!
hang in there john, you will be out of the void eventually.
Lock at the Meatpacking Industry in Germany. Not one bit better. However its completely our fault; the consumer: we want meat cheap! So we either have to pay more for it or stfu
(Upton Sinclair has entered the chat)
I just realized this is another LWT episode without Trump. Refreshing.
Ahh the meatpacking industry one where Union have been thoroughly crushed, sanitary measures largely ignored, the workforce is exploited, and it is run by a select few corporate oligarchs. The worst part is we are literally worse off then when Teddy Roosevelt was president and meatpacking industry was  broken up and regulated.
Betting on how many employees in a meatpacking facility would catch covid. And here I am, thinking that german meatpacking laws are a joke and that our agricultural ministry is sponsered by Nestle(R). Guess Tönnies still has a lot to learn! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%B6nnies_Holding
Yes, this is what I want to watch at 3am.
F - Tyson.
I feel like the only way we can teach American's Upton Sinclair's The Jungle is make it part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and stream it on Disney Plus.
Every time John Oliver Comes on I'm automatically like "YES!"
Immersion blender Is honestly my favorite utensil.
Including Asians in your statistic of the percentage of meatpackers by race has merit, but in America less than 10% of meatpacking factory workers are Asian. I'm not sure what the percentage is for Tyson specifically tho.
Ah yes, my favorite TV show is back: Our world is a capitalist dystopia, with John Oliver!
So they doubled the line speed, I wonder if these now twice as productive workers are also receiving twice the pay.  Except I'm actually not wondering that, at all.
At the center of it all lies the same problem, capitalism.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻  Totally forgot it was Sunday 😊😊
As much as I understand there could be a potential food shortage if these places were shut down, they should be looked into. Also I do think there's something wrong with the system in general after a certain amount of fines and no criminals charges are raised.
Land of the free...abusers.
Namaste 😂
All the slaughter videos never turned me off of meat. This one did. Kudos John.
🧐🧐🧐Yeah you’re right about the family and valuable assets part!🤔🤔🤔
*Dude !!! And which manager won the bet ????*
What is Judi Dench?
Nothing must die for me to live.
Judi dench is a fucking treasure let's be honest
I got some chicken nuggets before watching this    fuck me
LMAO... I used to work for Tyson.  It was horrible and I now refuse to eat anything produced by that company.  They are a big part of why I started raising and butchering my own chickens for food.  10 out of 10 would not recommend.

Go vegan! - watch cowspiracy on netflix for inspiration :)
I viciously hate 'capitalism'
John it’s 3am go back to bed
alright, not at all related, but the new profile pic is pretty neat! do miss the white background, but i like it
Staying up late never paid off so much
So what? Not going to stop eating meat, at least not until Star Trek's replicators aren't a thing, then I will just replicate me some tasty steak. Because I simply don't care. Like, I know about factory farms, I know how the sausage is made and I simply don't care. Now I know how meat packing facilities work and guess what? I still don't care. I literally could not care less about it, because I don't care at all.
Fabulous modern day slavery. Gotta love America, the land of the free.
Then quit the job
I girl at my car parts factory want to the bathroom on herself and she got punished for lol
Meatpacking facilities are disgusting all around the world. In germany even in the middle of a pandemic we flew in workers from poorer countries and stuffed them in makeshift homes like cattle. This happens year after year..
>Concrete Jungle intensifies
->Boycott meat...                          ...Go vegan!
I have missed this show.
I engaged with this content.
"If the penalty for a crime is a fine, then that law only exist for the lower class"
Finally, a good episode again. I don't want to hear about awful problems in MY life. I want to hear funny stories about how other people's lives suck in ways I don't have to give a shit about, like FIFA corruption.
ANY place of employment that forces its employees to frantically relieve themselves on the spot  is one place I wouldn't want to work! Good God!
Osha fines should be based around percentage, and never less than 1%, so that fines aren't simply part of the price you pay to be in business.
This kind of thing is why I’m trying to become an OSHA inspector myself. Despicable.
#capitalism
As a gay, I thought this was going to be a MUCH different video...
Smithfield is owned by the Chinese
America is totally not a 3rd world country 👍
Here's your mandatory "STOP EATING MEAT" comment. You're welcome.
1. Be overly literal when it supports your viewpoint. 2. Use curse words unexpectedly. 3. Have a random, maybe even a slightly controversial, opinion to give personality.
FMLA
Ofcourse it is in the USA! The land of the free home of the brave should be changed to Land of poor home of the enslaved and if left to the Republicans it would be a lot worse!
this your America huh?
Meatpacking plants were awful 50 years ago. Now it's 50 years later, and they're terrible in a whole new way. I can't think of a more shitty job than being a packer.
That is disgusting.... But the slave wages they pay to the working class is not...  Chicken? Meat? Naaaah! Eat The Rich!
I watched this while eating KFC and now I hate myself even more
There Is No Ethical Consumption Under Capitalism...  THERE IS NO ETHICAL CONSUMPTION UNDER CAPITALISM!!!
I don't share any of John Oliver's videos with my friends because I know they'll all say he sounds like a sex offender. He never cracks a sex-related joke that is anything other than disturbing.
I love how John says hoe-Willy shit
John teaches me about topics I didn't know existed in a hilarious way that makes me care about them.
We’re just rolling right back in to the world like nothing happened huh
Capitalist gulags everyone. Welcome to the land of freedom and democracy! /s  Edit: for poe's law.
John, you and your team of writers are modern day muck rakers. Keep up the good work!
I was going to sleep but ok
One more reason for me to transition into veganism
My parents both work in a meat plant and it’s horrible. It’s super hard but they pay more for than other jobs. During the pandemic, they did basically nothing at first then when the virus started spreading, our governor planned immigrants for the spread.
Funny thing, my bet was exactly 57,543 workers would test positive.
Feels nice that John's covering a topic that isn't too depressing 😂
Meatpackers are essentially highly skilled Amazon employees with knives .
I swear going vegan isn't as hard as most of you think, just try it <3
The earth is flat.
10:18 hey guys, remember when the news had that one voice and people were shocked that a**holes were allowed to be a**holes?
Oh my god the channel has a new avatar! After 8 years!
I'm one minute in, and I wonder if I'll ever be able to eat meat after this video
simply put America is Fuck up !
Eh, I'll watch it in the morning
18 minutes?? Wtf..
Capitalism, the most lucrative method of killing people ever created by our overlords.
Nothing like getting my depressing dose of reality from my favorite talking bird first thing in the morning.
Welcome back to the weekly reminder of how fucked we are as a society
Jungle II
Hmmm, how do Americans even feel happy and support capitalism if a vast majority of them are suffering because of corrupt capitalism?  Is it some kind of Stockholm syndrome or Suffering fetish?
So right about the phone on the ranks lol
Seine Rückenjungen  His back boys
I don't want to hear another word about how someone's feelings feel if I butcher a chicken at home.
Good to have you back. Cheers mate.
I think it was good that there was no live audience, I laughed my ass off when I saw the face of McChicken there
Bribing American government is cheap compared to Russian government... Lol They say who needs food and warmth when you have good government.
Fun fact on the food chain scale the average American is ~2.3 about the same as an earthworm, with the major outlier being Inuits eating traditional diets which are 4.9 to 5.0 aka above every predator on earth sans the orca. Fun fact.  Also most bears are pretty low since they are omnivores thats meat diet consists of many herbivores.
"fast food nation" was published two decades ago.
Judi Dench has received the Special Olivier Award and now also the "John Oliver Pedestal from an Offhand Comment"  2:20
Thought about Adam driver when he said nobody wants to be treated like a machine
lol I know how to pack my own meat I don't need no meatpacker to do it for me
I'd swipe right on u john ✨UwU✨
Solution could be to completely mechanize the industry.. Let's replace all of mankind with Machines. That would solve allot of issues actually.
4:28 i mean I'd swipe right ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
This is not a story on the stock market, wtf?
7:19  I will NEVER be able to look at an immersion blender ever again.  It is the robot soup fucker until the end of time LMAO.
John Oliver will be more of a journalist than any other current journalist will ever amount to be‼️‼️
......and that is why real Gs go vegan.
Hah joke's on you I did eat meat today but I'm in india so unless that meat is beef no one can lynch me
Damn, thanks for covering this
Those corporate execs, when they sit around the office? They sit AROUND THE OFFICE.
you need a holy hand grenade to deal with that rabbit... i mean guinea pig
my dad worked at a tyson factory in arkansas. they had an elephant burried out back..
anyone who liked the commercial is as low class as the maker
GO VEGAN 💚
Yaaaayyy early!
Food stores that serve Latin American customers often carry frozen guinea pig.
It felt so lonely laughing at all the funny parts, but no one laughing with me 😭
Does that bathroom have CARPET?  EWWWWW
You’re welcome. — This vegan ✌️
I'd love Adam Driver to pack his meatin me. And don't be gentle you soft-jawed king....
Since I'm early today,  how about I suggest a topic. I think you guys should do an episode on Turning Point USA.  They target young audiences and try to convert them into conservatism through misleading videos. They are well funded and were a huge part in the rise of Trumpism.
hang on, what is this? 1906?
HBO: John, the world is on fire because of covid, anti-vaxers, climate change, government incompetence, Twitter, Facebook, racism, homophobia, transphobia, and so much more.  John Oliver: So a meatpacking episode?  HBO: Perfect
"1st world country" in name only... The more Mr. Zazu speaks about it, the more its just in name...
Terrible industry to work in but sadly no thought for the billions of animals that experience pain and suffering in these torture factories, exactly the same way as your beloved pets at home would
I just threw up my Tyson anytizers.
Watching the kids of meatpackers protesting for their parents because covid was rampant at their workplace and no one gave a damn as workers died.... Well, I hope I never forget that.
That's weird, my local sewer plant has the same name as this guy. I wonder if they smell the same
The Pilgrim's guy look like a real life version of a Lich. Pretty sure he also sucks the vital energy of his employees too.
Lobbying:Bribery but legal.
I just wanna add, I worked as a factory worker for a time there having no real other choice and...  I felt this.
pack my meat Oliver
I'm super glad I dont eat meat
Slavery much !

"And If you fine a company a fraction of a percent of their profits, don't be surprised when they carry on only giving a fraction of a fuck about the welfare of their workers." - John Oliver
Omg a modern version of Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle
1:54 that's my line! They're going so fucking slow. Hahahahha. Probably for the cameras i guess. :D looked like my old supervisor too. Dewinged both by myself at full speed, baby.
And to think I almost had to work in one of these places
These Industries are the devil not only for the environment, but for the people working there and last but certainly least the animals...
Great, now I'm horrified of guinea pigs.
Very nice 😍💋 💝💖♥️❤️
The next pandemic.. meatpacking.. you've been gone so long, John. I just.. idk. I set my expectations on clarity for current issues but really it's my fault. I'm just tired.
"robot fuck a soup" got me
I’m waiting for gop, joe rogan, trumpees to start defending it
10:42 I smell the next bob murray coming
"Determining the worth of a total stranger by how much you wanna fuck them" 4:28  I'm dead
I can't compartmentalize any of the horror anymore.
Holy shit I'm here early too I started watching 2 minutes after uploaded
USA is so backwarts when it comes to the people. Greetings form Europe.
Hey, Do another one on voting machine hackers, For the loving hope of a real vote system!...  I made a playlist of all the proof, its easy to find.
I think Jim Perdue sicked that demon hamster on that family. They must be Tyson customers.
Yea I ate meat today, except I bought it from my local butcher.
18 minute video, 9 minuets in, 221 comments
This is the earliest I've ever been on a John Oliver video
Please do a video on farmers protest in India the farmers deserve it 😭🙏🏾
I think a bespectacled know-it-all toucan would stand a pretty good chance against a mildly aggressive pigeon.
I'm betting the Tyson stock price is about to plummet.
Corporate regulation is something every citizen should ensure is at the forefront of their mind when they vote. Deregulation-heavy politicians are only in it to get paid and let the rest of us suffer the painful result.
Hi. Did you know humans don't even need to eat meat? There are these things called plants.
Wait... who tf is Judi Dench?
Thanks for releasing this exactly at my lunch break
LMAO...THAT was a Perdue ad?! What an abysmal misfire.   The agency responsible shouldn't be hired again.
Just rename this show to:   John Oliver: exposing American industry one week at a time
did john miss the election results? the insurrection? the 2nd impeachment? oh, never mind
You'd think we'd have made conditions better for meatpackers and immigrants in the 116 years since Upton Sinclair published The Jungle, but you'd be wrong.
That ad went full Monty Python and the Holy Grail aggressive rodent on us. And let's not forget Perdu(e) is French for "lost". Made total sense to me.
a medium agressive pigeon 😭😭😭
Perform an exorcism, Jim, or get the fuck out of their house - that one British guy with a show
dope
I showed my friend the list of things people value and they moved everything one down and added "ROCK" to the top
There he goes again Mr. Oliver telling me about some unsuspected affair I didn't know about one minute ago and now I'll be worried for the next 15 minutes until I remember my life is quite a mess 😆
cool dude keep telling me abt fuckin meat packing
I think this might make some vegans upset.....
Well, this show turned off my desire to pet a Guinea Pig
And the imbeciles begin their comments
I should not be up this late
When the meatpacking industry talks about 'meat for the grinder'.. Ya gotta ask yourself if they mean the end cuts, or the new batch of employees.
And we all know that John wants Adam Driver to pack his meat
My guinea pig did that once too. I’m so glad I had a Perdue meal ready in 3 minutes!!!
Well, I didn't know at the time this was one of the reasons I went vegan but here we are. Happy not to support this horrible business in any way.
I wonder who came up with that advert "Hey let's make an ad on frozen meals with a Beelzebub possessed guinea pig trying to eat a family in the background, it's sure to rack up our sales"
Go Vegan.
Did Last Week Tonight just change their thumbnail?
Meatpacking, is that what the kids are calling it these days? XD
The last time I was this early john Oliver still had black hair
First 200... Yeah that's it
177th.
is it just me or does john look like he has a mid 90s psa filter over him today
Is that what the kids are calling it these days?
Why are our Meatpacking workers treated like shit?
Where does he keep getting these voids from?
Bo Pilgrim looks like the Pilgrim who suggested smallpox blankets in an educational cartoon that never made it to air, due to all the test screenings causing children to have nightmares.
*Ňℹ&&📧Ř* *♑🖕ĞĞ📧🔓* *👖ℹğģ📧♈* ♑♊♎♎⚕♌ *...... Woah..* 😮
->One more reason...                               ...we should all be vegan.
What in the Kentucky fried fuck was that commercial
The only news source I listen to now a days.
Yay I'm early
"Look. There are lots of good reasons to fire someone."  Like googling 'Meatpacker injuries' without safe search on.
I hate mr olive
What the hell was that ad?

It’s been almost a year without the audience laugh and yet I’m still not used to it.
You put Judy Dench above Dolly Parton?  You Brits have no respect.
First
John you are way better than we deserve, if only you could be qualified to become president.
exciting
What the hell in the quick meal trip was the ad?
Early in the pandemic there was a huge outbreak in a German meatpacking company, this report reminds me of that
I hope he does a running but with Judi Dench like he did with Keanu Reeves🙏🏼
Less than half of one percent of workers who contracted covid died of covid. I’d say they have a better chance with covid than they do eating Tyson chicken.
It smells like beef...IT SMELLS LIKE BEEEF
The video has been out for 3 minutes and already has 107 comments. What the fuck are you guys commenting about?
*Upton Sinclair’s reincarnated skeleton rises from his grave*
I feel like with each show, John becomes more and more insane, until one day, It'll just be him bursting out of a man-sized Pringles can while yelling crisps not chips over and over again.
Who else looks forwards to Monday’s now that John is back😅
I need more episodes now. Right in my veins. I hunger for more John. The content is too exquisite.
When John Oliver says “HOLY SHIT”, you know we just saw some messed up shit.
If work says you’re a family it’s a red flag to take advantage of you. It’s a job they don’t care about you remember that.
I'd rather see a piece on fudge packing.
2 anti-meat segments in a row? hmmmm
Second Trump's out-of-office John Oliver runs out of political topics to talk about I guess I'm just happy I got regular content
Ultra early
Dope. I was waiting for this after last week's topic
Go vegan.
4 mins
Back to good ol' normal depressing stories, instead of maga depressing stories.
Coincidentally, meatpacking is also the name of the last porno I watched.
Please cover the violence thats been happening against Asian Americans in recent weeks next. These stories need to be told.
Judi Dench is also 3rd on my list. You cannot live without it.
they changed their picture for the channel, wow
Can I just say that I like the gray John Oliver more? I feel like we can get more content in less time.
Okay, whomever made that ad at the start, is way too newschool for me.
This is terrible the video is up for to minutes and I’m 88thon the comment
When John Oliver made a joke about meat, I was expecting an Adam Driver joke... Disappointed 😂 😂 😂
Promise me Adam driver
John: "Tonight, we're going to be talking about meatpacking." Me: **Puts down the Tyson Ranch Chicken Chip**
Honestly, that opening Perdue commercial was better than any other part of this segment
This is ✨weird✨
So happy for this show, MrNutterButter lool
two minutes and we are already in
Last week tonight makes Sunday night before the work week more bearable
I’m just here for the meat packing butt jokes, thanks.
That hulkish guinea pig ad tho👀
Try going vegetarian once a week guys <3
Finally, a show on youtube that ACTUALLY makes sense.
Penetrate my ignorance you pasty slice of perfection
Mmm this is giving me 2015 vibes. Remember that chicken segment of  Last Week Tonight?
lol
If it was a rabbit, they would actually be dead
80th
Me: Time to sleep. I need to get up early *Last Week Tonight YouTube notification pops up* Also me: Alright. It's just 20 minutes
Omg love John Oliver 😂
Next week: FUDGE PACKING
My earliest time
What?! another video about how destructive the meat industry is? I'm sure not eating meat is gonna be recommended this time :/
I'll be back later when the jokes are here
Here early too
Welcome to another installment of "Everything wrong with unregulated capitalism with John Oliver".
My word
John need you to do one the Farmer Protests in India
I'm first til I refresh
Ah! My weekly bad news is here 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
I was gonna go to sleep, might as well just go ahead and guarantee nightmares
I’ve never really said what the fuck out loud from YouTube but dude.... Jim. Wtf
Definitely not eating bacon for breakfast
That bloody ad was funnier than anything humanity will ever do
I'm in the first 20 seconds and it's already a shit show i love it
This is what i spend my afternoons doing     and it's time well spent
I couldn’t sleep cause I have a cold and I was just blessed
I really thought it would be about factory farming...
125 views. Nice timing.
Meat packing, like the next phase of meat glue?
cum
John? Are you reading this? ;v;
Bruh I was about to go to sleep and now I gotta watch this 20 minute video
I thought this was going to be about ur mum
whoa ive never been this early
John Oliver can make even the most bizzare topics sound interesting
You know what I'm here for John, that's right...    *The Adam Driver jokes*
GIVE ME LIKES. I DID COME EARLY.
1 mins in and 37 comments lol
I’ve missed this show so much
