My hero academia and one piece I'm looking at you. You are guilty of this and other animes I don't know yet
I know someone has said it already, this Deku from MHA most scenes 😂
2:22 that stare into my soul
deku from my hero
THANK YOUUUU!!!!!
hilarious 😭😭😭
his reaction 0:25 STILL kills me to this day
0:12 hycybh?
Izuku has been real quiet since this dropped
*cough* demon slayer *cough*
This is real.
Tenya Iida
i was unironically like this in high school lol
Lol
My hero academia in a nutshell.
2:07 Bro is not deku 🥀🥀
Bru why is he crying like bro
I love this sketch 🙏🏼🌈🌻😂🌹
This need to be my inner voice fr😅
this is my favorite Caleb video
this lowkey be me sometimes, like no joke
1:43 aye that’s a real ass friend tho no self deprecation around here
I’d like to think this is a sequel to “Everything reminds Anime characters of some type of tragic event”
Bros acting is so good im getting annoyed at this character just like when i watch ac anime irl😂
1:11 You didn't need to call me out like this
At that point, take your homey to therapy.
Not gonna lie, this is me every time I need to hype myself up pre or post workout.
Haha the agh back killed me 😂
Thats that suicidal person try to keep their head in the game
This fuckin guy, manages to talk to himself, and im over here cringing because his character is causing his other character social discomfort. It's double fake, and im still cringing brother.. God dammit.
He forgot to add the running and crying in slow motion.
I think this is the reason why some people hate my hero academia
This guy is a menace oh my goodness 😂 "YOU'RE NOT TRAAASHH"
awesome video.1 point.  The outro thanks for subscribers message could have been a motivation speech.
This video prolly added 10 years to my life for the amount of times I've cried laughing.
LMAO!!
Imagine if anime writers made a character who does NOT want to deal with this shit
Makes me think of Hunter x Hunter & DBZ 🤣
Literally deku
Deku
*Insert* Rean Schwarzer of Cold Steel Arc-
this annoyed me
This is so true in Anime
Why is this soooo on point? Anime is so extra and I LOVE IT
Deku in a nutshell
The last one is so real, especially with the inspirational music buildup and the tight balling of the fists 😭😭😭
I remember laughing so hard on this one bro😂😂😂
Hairo from saiki k (love this guy)
He’s been looking for the keys this whole time and could never find them
I'm 3 years late on this one, but hell nah 🤣🤣🤣
Basically every star wars movie except for the cartoons in a nutshell
Deku when he stubs his toe “This stubbed toe won’t stop me. I have to keep going, to be the best I can be! To be the number one hero!”
Eren Yäger
Some animes are just so overly dramatic I can't remember the name of the anime but it was when some highschool student guy was outside screaming like a psycho to his crush confessing how much he loves her but going a bit over board...like he's outside the school standing by where the windows are open and him screaming I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU!!!! I LOVE YOU!! but like over and over again idk but that guy was nuts lolo I mean try that in real life you'll be getting the cops called 🤣
Good
My hero ❤ 😂😂😂 plus ➕  ultra
this should be called when your homie watches to much anime
This is Takemichi from TR 🤣
The correct term is *Naruto*
Anime characters with endless motivational speeches are truly inspiring! Their words have the power to uplift and encourage. 🌟🎌
Bro this guy is such a good actor I can’t
Covering the eyes during the speech is such an anime thing.
The heartbeat had me 💀
Deku in a nutshell
Bro the way I fell out when he looked at the camera💀
Just give this guy an oscar already
Imagine having a friend like this during exams..
I can see how hard you’re trying not to laugh 😂😂😂
Rock Lee
“I promise I’ll do my best 😢”
Naruto and Decku be like:               (Mostly Decku)
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Talk no Jutsu 😂
Wow this was a great Deku impersonation
So good dude.  Hoooooooonsinikonwadatadi
bro fr on the yt playlist
Stand Proud, you are not trash
Gon and Killua
AND LOVE AND LIKE❤😅
he made it into a youtube playlist oh god
I like
Def Genos and Saitama
i feel bad for his neighbors
It looks like the other guy is having a mental breakdown 😂
Its the way he got his arms out to the side just slightly
He has the hidden eyes part down pat lol
I've met people who unironically do this.
this may be ur best vid
i promise ill do better😂
This really is Deku the skit
🤣🤣🤣
Naruto in a nutshell.
I genuinely have no idea what emotions to feel
This yugi friends everytime he’s losing a duel lmao
Basically, this is Attack on Titan in a nutshell, aside from fighting Titans.
I am feeling somewhat called out here
Your neighbors have had it
the sleeping one reminds me of rock lee😂😂
This is why I can't get into one piece. It's not the length of the series (which is admittedly too long for me), it's the constant yelling and speeches over nothing. And the synchronized yelling is even worse. Over stimulating and annoying.
Motivation man
w video
OHHHH thats were this one audio comes from;-;
There's always that one classmate
He finally used different parts of that song!
Reminds me of rock lee
LOL
1:50 my replay button for this to knwo I can lower my volume
Can you made a part 2
When you’re reading a fanfic but it’s so Incredibly OOC and the author has no idea when too much detail and monologue is too much. BRO YOUVE SAID THE SAME “I had no idea how to approach this subject, my eyes like saucers I stared with terrified intent-“ WE KNOW, *WE KNOW*
Bruh
The screams are on point
Basically DJ Khaled?
i wish someone randomly gave me a praise filled speech. that'd be a real confidence booster
Luffy
This my favorite video on this channel,  keep it up!!!
Nobody: Literally nobody: This guy while getting to sleep: AAAAAAAAAAAAA I WILL MAKE MY FAMILY PROUD AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I WILL GET TO SLEEP AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa
TBH I could use that hype sometimes
lol
this is what it would *actually* be like to get isekai'd
Bruh
This is my "last to get woke" homeboy that finally sees everything 7 years later. Now ever word is a motivational lecture.
I think ive heard tanjiro do all of these xD
This is waaaay to accurate
this is so fuJCIERJGjmgfngsding awkward for white shirt guy.
Naruto and mha in a nutshell
Imagine being his neighbors though
NEVER BACK DOWN NEVER WHAT???🗣🗣
Why am i both crying and cringing atst😂
You know when a character pulls this shit it's a huge death flag 99% of the time
When I talk to my parents, "Look mom, that character in the game is so stupid, he's jerking off while floating in outer space."  Mom, "Son, being stuck in outer space is not a choice anyone can make, some people had it harder, some people had it easier. We are obligated to make a living to survive in this world and if one has to be stuck in space to jerked off, either he was forced to and he is willing, willingly means that he is a test subject. Life is tough, lion, zebras, donkeys all have 1 thing in common and that is they drink water to be alive, water that certain countries do not have any access to, but I won't name those countries because it would cause racial issues and tension among humanity. We as humans have to respect each other, be helpful and caring, anyway you understand what I'm trying to say. What I want to say is, did you remember where I put my reading glasses?"
The real keys were the friends we made along the way
Omg this was too good. I loved how his eyes were perfectly hidden too. And the dramatic screaming-  0:19 Heart noise equals anime self unlocked
This is still my favorite lol
The look in the camera at the end had me rolling, like it was a look of disbelief and hopelessness mixed with almost bubbling over anger
Awesome videooooooooooo! But…….. I know u can do betterrrrrrr! DONT GIVE UUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPP AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
😢I was like what you looking at me for... He is YoUr friend... 😂
Caleb looks like he’s about to slide Caleb.
When he said "Take it BAAAACK!!" I felt that
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bruh I can't imagine what they would say if u save them from a fire😂
Bru literally rengoku in a nutshell 🔥
Nice video
Crazy? I was crazy once. They locked me in a room. A rubber room a Rubber room with rats rats makee crazy. Repeat x25
I appreciate his fox plushies
It's actually cringy in real life 😂😂
This video doubles as a positive affirmations video
I CAN DO THIS! *CRIES*
every cw show
😂😂😂
This remindes me of Asta!
"It's cool. It's keys"
Naruto 😂😂😆
Your so exceptional 😂😂😂
Asta in person be like lol
Luffy fr
Bro imagine if people did this irl? That would just be embarrassing
Girlfriends be like
I love how he just screams at the anime dude lmao at 1:40
1:09 thats me when i used to play for honor or chivalry
me lowkey
I feel personally called out by this
Bro this shit had me cryingggtgt
The neighbor hearing him:
This gives off deku vibes and it’s exactly why I stopped watching that babbling fool 🤣
Literally MHA
Naruto be like🤣
twist plot: the guy in the white tshirt is the one who put the keys their
👂 🩸
Yo what's that fox plushie on the couch? I want that lol.
This guy literally ALWAYS makes me burst out with laughter it’s like garunyeed seratonin
THE TEARS and the rage compliments. too accurate! also 2:30-2:32 killed me🤣
Lmfaooooo
Bro watch attack on titan that is explained by this video with only 3:08 minutes 😂
He was sleeping with his cap. I mean motivating himself to sleep.
D E K U
Been watching tokyo revengers and I immediately thought of this video
Only girls smack they llips
It would be great to see something like this put into an actual anime or something 😂
Gohan and Naruto... 💀💀💀💀
Persona irl
0:44 I know it's been a few years, but I think if he said something among the lines of "you were my key all along" or "the real key is the friends we made among the way"
I'm not exactly sure I'd call the first one especially a "motivational speech", more so just a reaction lol
Need captions so i can watch this while shitting in public
That last one had me dying when he checked his phone, and then he got even louder
tanjiro
Naruto in a nutshell 💀
Damn if you throw Deku's costume on Caleb I might get the two confused with each other xD
rock lee
Tell me this isn't genos from one punch man
Yo what's the song in the first clip I need it so bad
Is Caleb 100 Thieves?
*YOU'RE NOT TRAAASSHHH*
Fucking Midoriya😂
This feels like the Flash.
Very funny video I like it
YO I'M FUCKIN DYING- 😭
Is this a black clover x Naruto reference?? 😭😭😭
Lmao I spit out my water
Hella motivated for some reason
Deku be like:
My man here summed up Naruto and My Hero Academia in three minutes
literally one piece characters when someone gives them a potato chip
Everyone needs this guy in their life🤣
Did i just watch an episode of Naruto?
Deku👀
he sounds like Rock Lee
I love the "he always does this" energy the white hat guy emits.
This video is pure fax and this is why i dont watch anime as much
1:04
Would you look for a new roommate? He's annoying, but he's just really supportive. You can't let him down, right?
dont do my boy deku like that
Nobody is talking about when he said "SHUT. UP. SHUT UP!!!" that had me rolling 🤣🤣🤣
I imagine his neighbors just listening him screaming "YOU'RE NOT TRASH!!!, YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAL!!!!" And be like his probably going  trough a tough time and thinking if they should call mental health to check on him.
2:22 bro's 'boutta break the 4th wall
Live action Naruto Shippuden:
I need someone to dub over Deku with this shit, he's the first character I think of on this video
Sasuke trying to be a emo bastard child. While naruto being the annoying side character
This has to be your funniest one 😂😂😂😂
Nah those ashy feet took me out 😭
Fkn crybaby from Tokyo revengers 🤦🏾‍♂️
"TAKE IT BAAACK" IM CRYING BRO
I exploded with the "YOU ARE NOT TRAAASHHH" HAHA so funny man 🤙
😂😂😂
Deku.
This is actually a thing.
Put in Grande tim  😊 Yes
tbh i don't even watch anime, i just like CalebCity
this is naruto one every fight
This is why I can’t watch hikyuu
The fact that the motivational caleb makes me  cringe and annoyed its great acting
😂😂😂😂
YOUR EXCEPTIONNALLLL
Hairo from tdlosk vibes
“I-it’s cool. It’s *keys.”* 💀
You can just say Armin..
I hate that I’m this guy bruh 😭😭
1:48 That voice crack tho
Deku when All Might breathes
This deadass be Deku all the time bro
Aw but it is hella sweet that his friend knows where he leaves his keys 😂
Naruto
this is the prequel to "your friends that are too down for you"
people be like
I'm watching AoT for the first time and holy FUCK every episode is just this over and over.
This is just my pessimistic side fighting with my optimistic side honestly
Why did the last one sound like Deku😭😭
Don't worry, the heart of the bullshit will lead you to the right place.
Hey look it's deku
Now me personally, I would never, EVER, let someone wake me up at 3 in the morning like that and get away with it…    *But that’s just me though. I dunno about you.*
Takemitchi Hanagaki
The way he looks at him when he starts his episode every time kills me.
he shouldve made a motivational speech about buying his youtooz
Deku be like:
It's painful how true this is. They can just make a big deal out of literally *ANYTHING.*
Damn.  Why do I feel like watching Black Clover?
deku be like
We all know that one Weeaboo that saw a single TED Talk and thought that they can have every conversation sound just like that. Yeah me too...
I held 5, pressed 6 immediately after and started losing it.
I really hope he set the time to 3 and didn’t actually scream cliche anime style speeches at 3 in the morning
2:22  BEST. 4TH WALL BREAK. EVER.
I would've been like stfu bruh tf wrong with you tf 😂
Nearly falls over Him: (starts the family monologs past from the year 200BC)
This is how I remember Naruto part 1
"UR NOT TRASH"           I'm not trash I'm rubbish
Ee
The fact that you can just reenact an anime plot and make it so hilarious is AMAZING
“Ayo, queue the Naruto swing. This bout to be a saucy!”
The rudest canadian:
Talk no jutsu🔥😂😂😂
Cringe
naruto be like
Bru spech Number two is so🤣🤣🤣🤣
"And everyone wants to be like you because you're so exceptional".  If I had a dollar for every time they said something like this in Naruto. Just the word exceptional alone.
As far as shonen heroes, that's mainly Naruto, Deku, and Tanjiro to name a few.  Goku, Gon, Luffy, and Yusuke just wanna fight people. No inspirational speeches, they just cut to the chase.  Ichigo and Natsu give motivational speeches but the main difference is they're always pissed off when they do it.
You're clearly talking about "My hero academia"😂
the best moment to say its not that deep
Shinji kins be like
How he make his body bounce while he’s yelling 😂
I'm back again and still crying over this video 🤣🤣
god izuku is annoying
NO ITS NOT RIDICULOUS THIS HAPPENED! YOURE AMAZING! YOURE EXCEPTIONALLLL!!
The way bro said “YoUrE nOt TrAsH,” and “your exceptional”  Bro man moved so slowly yet it was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen
Crazy good 🤣🤣🤣
In one instance, It'd be nice to have such support, then again there's only so much you can have of it.
Pov: you're tanjiro
Imagine that your friend always showing the motivational speech always
1:33 "YOURE NOT TRAAAASHHHHHH-" "SHUT UP."   😭😭😭
From MHA.Deku to be specific
That 100T cap looks good though
Inazuma eleven in a nutshell
Deku
Gon in every episode of HxH
I love you for calling this out.
Someone out here needs to hear this 1:32
anime is git too dramatic for like the tiniest stuff man
What a comedic genius  I laughed so hard XD
Yooooo this is making me smile and laugh hard but also giving me good vibes  like tears coming out for both reasons
YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Now he knows how his neighbours always feel
I like how he makes his hat cover his eyes just like anime that shades it.
Christian moms praising God whenever anything good happens
why he open the drawer like dat 😭😭
He got so annoyed he broke the fourth wall 😂
0:58 : Caleb's neighbors every time he makes a video
Anybody else getting Naruto flashbacks?
Laughed myself to tears to the point where my eyes got tired and I had a good night’s rest. Truly needed this
Caleb city has a 69-420 IQ
That scentenceted where he's like I'll be just as good as you one day made me think of fruits basket
I never noticed how annoying that would be in real life
This is so much like Mha
The ultimate try not to laugh challenge
LOLLLL THE ONE ABOUT THE GUY SLEEPING IS SO ACCURATE!! Also for all of these I thought of Midoriya 🤣honestly now all anime has been revealed to me
I’m LITERALLY crying
Dawg i need a wife like caleb
This is why I want to kill Deku
The first one is exactly how rock lee is😂💯
one sleeps with a hat one.  one puts a hat on immediately after getting out of bed.
Izuku Midoriya be like:
Moon man rider
And then they become the villain "I couldn't be like you, you were always such a good person and you were always supporting me. I couldn't do anything for myself, maybe I was meant to be this way."
Got me in tears😭🤣
Skits like this, really get me to feel for Calebs neighbors They might not be able to sleep, but they sure will be motivated
*laughs in uncle iroh*
Midoriya straight up 😂😂
I feel so bad for his neighbors..
Literally Tanjiro
ominous positivity at its finest
This reminds me of how in some anime series, supporting characters fall head over heels over other characters or the protag right on the spot for absolutely no good reason.
i feel called out
1:56 idk why he was so mad, it was a saturday
This is one of his best vies
naruto, deku, ash ketcham
That cut at 1:48 had me actually dying
Are we not gonna talk about how he said hes gonna have exams tomorrow yet his phone says its Saturday?
The way the hat was hiding his face was genius
1:12 the way he stands there face down is literally the most anime thing ever
He is just like an snooping hypeman
Thats when his "friend" becomes his rival/villain because he's tired of his shit
To be honest I would really like to have a friend like that
I love when they black out the eyes ctfu
why this remind me of gon from hxh
This figurine lets me know that we are similar
The awkward motivational yelling is so accurate 😂 “TAAAAKE IT BAAAAAACK”
So Basically MHA
Naruto lol
Why do I feel like I’m being called out? I’m totally black hat dude lmao.
young Armin from AOT S 1&2 XD
It's always so funny when he looks at the camera
He made deku
I literally spit spite all over my iPhone while watching this
He was playing for honor
So this is where the Wonder egg meme came from
"You're exceptional! Take back what you said." Wish I had freinds like this honestly
Gurren Lagann.
The trash bit actually is a mood I remember playing halo reach swat and I was like .2 kd and I got domed after missing like 5 straight shots and said “oh my god I’m garbage” and my grandpa came in the room yelling at me to not talk down on myself and I was genuinely just confused.
😂😂😂
I just love this guy what a legend
Yup this video swayed my thumb to sub 🤣🤣
THE CAP HIDING THE EYEEESSSS-- I CANNNN'TTTT
1:02 i just want that poofy fox plushie how do i get that
My manhood may be tiny….but i’ll never give up! Meanwhile the villain: what does that even have to do with our fight?
remind me of haikyu lol
Naruto in a nutshell
Me: *says something negative about myself* My friend : "TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAID. TAKE IT BAAAAAAAA-"
that motivational voice is too accurate lol😂
you have summed up zoids wild in 3:07
This entire video, especially the second scenario gave me major one piece vibes.
my sister has been yelling at me to stop laughing it isn't working 🤣
When he stared at the camera it felt so real tf
Having a support character > having no friends because your a struggling cocaine / pill addict   Love the vids C Bro !
The funniest guy on YouTube hands down.
Deku be like that 🤣🤣🤣🤣
"even when you're clearly better then them" that subtle tone change there was hilarious 🤣🤣
TAKE IT BAAAAAAA-
This is how weeb friends WANT you to act  YOU ARE NOT TRASH TAKE IT BACK
It's okay you can say Deku
"I've been looking for the keys this whole time... but little did I know... our FRIENDSHIP is the key!!"
Man this guy has a really nice house
The mfka dream speeching 😂😆😂🙏🏾😆
Naruto
Watched a few episodes of Clash of titans. But the main char constantly did this. Gave a 10 minute speech. Either to himself of his friends but during the 10 minutes he kept saying. We only have a few seconds..   Its why i stopped watching
*"YoUr AmAzInG."*  Man, if I had a dime for every time I heard that line in anime...
This is too funny
THANK YOU!
Why am I getting MHA vibes tho???
when he was laying there talking to himself is the funniest shit ever
"you serve zero purpose"
wait are we just gonna ignore the super cute huge fox plushie next to caleb while he sittin on the couch?!
@2:22 that music theme gets me everytime lmao
This is me to my friends all the time
this is what living with deku in S1 would probably be like
1:06 Me after losing to Hit Awoken in ranked in xeno 2
This is any given scene in my hero academia
So basically one punch man?
The gasp is perfect!☆
Those are low-key my worst anime characters.
This is probably my favorite skit😂😂😂😂
MHA
Talk no jitsu in a nutshell
Deku when
I want to say that this is Midoriya but Takemitchy be on this same wavelength if not more in just 1 season.
This never fails to make me laugh until it hurts
OTHER GUY: THANK YOU!!!!! HIM: DAMN
HAHAHAAHHA MY 10 YO SISTER IS JUST LIKE THIS HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAH specially when I say Im trash or something HAHAHAHAAHAH
Talk no jutsu
😭😭😭
Rock lee be like
Izuku Midoriya 😂
Its just keys
aight- imma need ya'll to be truthful...     who recorded deku without his permission and acknowledgement
100% Toaru Majutsu no Index - In like every Episode Kamijou Touma holding a speech. At first i was like "yea tell them", but after some episodes i was screaming at the monitor "shut the f*ck up dude!" :@
I don’t get why grown men yelling at each other is funny
him:YOURE NOT TRAAAAAAASH YOURE NOT TRAAAAASH the other guy:BRO SHUTUUUUP BRO SHUTUUUUP
😂😂😂😂this has to be my favorite
Oh my god that’s  fax!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why id never wanna be in a shounen
This man ate
Mugen Train Ending
Talk-no-jutsu at its finest.  WE'RE THE SAME BRO
You wake up to put a hat on & go to sleep in one too 😂😭 I instantly heard naruto background music during the speeches in my head though 😂
Where can I get the plush. 1:07
deku be like :
My hero
TAAAKE IT BAAACKKK
“YOUR NOT TRASHHHH!!” “SHUT UP!” I’m deadass crying bro😂😂
I would hate to have rock lee as friend
This is why I don't watch My Hero
Midoriya is that you?
One piece basically.. But I love it
This guy like naruto and rock,metal lee
Gold 💕👏😂👏💕
Why my stomach gotta be hurting from Laughing every darn vid I see? Is there away to prepare before I watch a vid on here?
I like how I have to guess which Caleb is going to say a speech
💀💀💀💀💀LMFAOOO THE WAY HE WAS SCREAMING AND SAYING HE WAS NOT TRASH THOOO 🤣🤣🤣
Naruto characters when their friend buys them a snack to be nice:
First one was literally Sakura for most of Naruto and Naruto Shippuden
just imagine a friend like this, overreacting to something big yet really small. i don’t think we would want friends like this except the anime ones who like that kind of stuff.
The keys were actuall a key to save the entire cosmos
“You’re such a good person, you’re my friend!”  The friend: SHUT UP!
so.....you mean Deku, I GOT OVER IT IN SEASON 3 EVERYTIME HE STARTS NOW I SKIP THE EPISODE
This is Sakura…
so like every main character
Anybody else just see that really f*cking dumb peanut butter mixer ad
These speeches always make me cringe
1:36 looks like his words moved him
The epic part was how he would hide his eyes with the cap brim every time he got "emotional". 😂😂😂
Definitely attack on titan
I swear, i've seen some anime skitz before, but none were as authentic as this. This is gold
the japanese truly are lacking in chill
I usually hate videos with a whole bunch of yelling becuz it’s annoying to my ears but this was too funny not to listen to.
every mc
lol this is so accurate for a lot of animes. Recently saw Yowamushi Pedal & Hunter X Hunter and it's a lot like that. tbh I like the heartwarming stuff but it becomes too much many times, like as filler for the episode or something.
When u got 100 score in exam without study 0:26
bruh this is literally midoriya, especially at 2:08 it reminds me of the beginnning of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFiNMAtrGAs
Love this voice over of calebcity https://youtu.be/pe-jt12qNok
screaming in his sleep tho 😂
*cough* DEKU. *cough*
This sounds like something Deku would say
Please name specific anime characters
His voice makes it all too real lmao
This is definitely deku in a nutshell
Oct 2021 sold OUT in RE to the youtooz
2:04 nobody talking bout how he woke up and straight away put a hat on
The way he had his cap down on his face reminded me of ash Ketchum from Pokémon 🤣🤣🤣
Alternative title: Caleb angrily compliments himself for 3 minutes.
This a personal attack on naruto
I could not even watch because of laughing so hard due this is so top dog shit
Oh noo not again
“You’re screaming at 3 in the morning” that’s me with my roommate sadly.
As someone who watches a lot of anime ,i was crying at this looks in real life.
dnd’s inspiring leader feat
the way he closed his eyes and yelled pretty accurate
This is SO TRUE. Like the motivational friend's voice sounds like any random anime person saying a motivational speech
That's why I stopped watching anime.
Literally 🤣
My hero in a nutshell😗
Is actually just like me to my friends and they to me hahaha cause I always said that I’m a trash and they are like noooo you’re noooot!
😂😂😂😂
The fact that he has the camera angle on the anime dude perfectly setup so that his eyes have that shadowed/obscured effect is amazing.
The sad thing is that this was subtle. Anime's are even more over the top with their overemotional parts.
MC: saves friend from bully MC when in battle: man, I’m injured I can’t do this.  Friend: DONT GIVE UP BECAUSE YOU NEVER GAVE UP ON ME! MC: instantly gets healed*  But really the accuracy is THERE.
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.   For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. John 3:16‭-‬17 KJV
Would be fun with an anime with all these tropes with just a few people that acts like regular people
maybe the real keys were the friends he made along the way
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Usually I just smile when i see a funny video, it's very difficult to make me laugh to be honest. But this video... I laughed so hard i cried !! Let me tell you this is a premiere !!!!! YOU RE NOT TRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASH
he reminds me of Mumen Rider from one punch man
So true.
Definitely deku
I wish i had a friend like this
My Hero Academia low key turning into this and it’s starting to annoy me. Lol
1:51 I was kinda hoping that the white-shirt Caleb was the one who couldn't sleep, thinking about the exams. Then black-shirt Caleb suddenly appears in his room, "YOU'RE BETTER THAN YOU THINK YOU ARE!!! YOU'LL PASS THOSE EXAMS BECAUSE OF HOW GREAT YOU ARE!!!" The white-shirt Caleb would then get the shit scared out of him and fall off the couch.
The last clip was so fucking funny hahahaha
alright, thank you - damn! 😂
What a coincidence, the time i’m watching this video is exactly 3:18 and it s the same time shown in his phone at 2:02  Woow
Lol My hero academia in a nutshell. Overrated ass show.
1:50 had me on the ground
This is sooo Genos in one punch man 😂😂😂
Play You Can Become A Hero - MHA OST. As he is doing the speeches lol
The end is sad
Only thing missing was the water balls and this would have been golden
this reminds me of that green haired boy in almight anime that was the only and last anime i watched
"YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAL" "AAAAHHHH"
0:26 That look  Its not first time :D
Midoriya to Bakuugo
Bruh it's almost been a year and I cant get over this video lmao
Naruto tryna talk Sasuke into going back to the Leaf Village.
I thought that at the end of the video he would make a motivational speech about the great support we give him
This deku to bakugo
God I can actually picture this in an anime especially the reaction to the keys
This video = Boku no hero :D
Man's is sleep speeching
I liked how he looked at the audience because he knows that's what we deal with
Lol my hero be like
Isn’t this why people watch Japanese dub?
Because of these motivational speeches, I root for the villains.
Rock Lee be like:
So basically, Midoriya (Deku) from Boku No Hero Academia.
Deku
I unwillingly unsubscribe to the channel laughing 😂😂
Wow i cant believe Deku took over this guys channel!
Deku cry baby ass
I want one of those people that do that as friends lol.
he hate it till the dude dead
"TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAID" *PUNCHES IN THE FACE*

This was perfect. Imma need you to name names tho cuz my girl dont get the joke
“Your always covering for me” idk where but I feel like I’ve heard that line a thousand times
Any grateful anime character: ARIGATO
I dont watch much anime but that last one was hilarious and relatable.
I think I might just pretend to be like this character. He's awesome might cheer someone up.
I wish I had a friend
I’m convinced that this not about anime, but about a depressed clingy friend.
XD why he gotta be so loud? You can be motivational without putting on your caps lock XD
1:33 LMAO🤣
talk no jutsu
Best video of his, i'm dead
Omg this one got me dying😂😂😂😂😂it’s too accurate

‘I’ve been looking for the keys this whole time but could never find them. Little did I know, I had a friend… in YOU!’  What is this, Kingdom Hearts?

I need someone to tell me I’m exceptional the way caleb city tells himself
1:54 imagine you’re doing this and someone records you and shows you...
Might guy and kakashi when they were younger

To be honest this is probably what his neighbors deal with every night ...

No one hurts my friends then they power up
That head posture🤣
2:30 my man is powering up
1:06 you we're playing For Honor, weren't you?

Deku:
this is so accurate
deku
It about Brock lee
this is the plot of of fairytail, complete with 20 panel shots of 50 characters showing their face reactions simultaneously as the speech goes on for five pages, extra points if someone screams "WE ARE FAMIIIILLYYYYY" at the end. definitely not calling natsu out or anything
Rock lee explaining that ur not trash
Someone watched My Hero Academia
Tbh an anime character friend who yells motivation all day sounds good right now
Deku every time he speaks
Its so accurate when his eyes disappear as well.
Anyone else think of Deku the whole time watching this?
TAKE IT BACK!!!!!
So this is basically RWBY
This is literally Ash every time he loses in a Pokémon battle, or it’s an entire movie and the legendary Pokémon is going crazy.
I am CRYING.
Whenever luffy does anything nice to anyone they do this
2:22 I had happened to look away and 10 seconds later he was still looking and that got me laughing like a goat
The only thing i love is there is no intro
One anime trope I hope gets left behind with newer titles. (along with many other annoying tropes)
ITS KEYS GAW DYAM
Honestly if my friend talked down to themselves in any way I would shoot them with a gun full of love
finally, found some videos about funny conversations
This is just deku 😂😂😂😂

Genos
this is exactly what my parents want me to become
*cooks*  “You know, me and my mom always used together when I was little. But then, *sobs* she died in a car accident. Thank you for giving back my memories, friend.”  Da Chef: “Shut your dumbass up”

Anime secondary charachter at the middle of the plot arc: I don't know what to do. Maybe if i ask my parents for an advice... Anime main character and best friend/crush of the secondary: *emotional music starts playing* Is not your parents who decide your future, because IT'S YOUR FUTURE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT! You have to choose what makes you happy and be proud of that, no matter what the others say, YOU CAN DO IT!
Does Caleb have neighbours? Lol

if you look close enogth on 0:26 you can se that by the look on his face it isnt the first time that this happend meaning that is an frequent thing.
Deku be like: *You noticed, you copied my style*
When you think about it Naruto really messed up people.
am i watching my hero academia
Rock Lee has entered the chat
"Its cool, its keys(?)"
This is how watching AoT is.
This is basically deku to almight
I love the fox plushy! 😍 @1:02
so, basically kaito from danganronpa V3
"Guy sensei....."
Armin in Attack on Titan everytime Eren or Mikasa saves him
Man, it really sounds stupid in real life.
This is deku lol
I didn’t know Deku worked with Caleb
Yo this is the most funniest vid
YoUR’e EXCEPTIONALLLL!!😂😂☠️
@Deku
1:34 Sorry Caleb, you can’t out-scream and Anime character.
I wish I have a funny friend like you, watching your videos makes me laugh even during the hardest times ❤ thank you bro, you're a real hero ⚘🍻
This video is so accurate lol
Alternative title: If Australian anime was a thing
All mcs. In a nutshell
This is litterly hinata every second
My guy really speaking about  Eren
So, isn't this every anime when the good guy loses in anime The louder you cry while giving a speech the more likely you will miraculously win
EREN YAEGER IN A NUTSHELL
This is every character in Shounen manga
I wonder if he waited til 3 in the morning to film the phone clock part or changed the time manually. The reason I think he would wait til 3 am is because Caleb is such an exceptional youtube creator that he would do that sort of thing to remain authentic.
every shonen anime ever
Ohh have you ever watched my hero academia
Please make a sequel PLEASE
2:21 Caleb has idea to kill his room-mate.
You're so cute
Anime girls that love the person who helped them:

1:01 I want those plushies you have at your left I seriously do and 0:22-0:28 is the best part.
I hate the fact that this is me in real life  and yes, it's because Naruto and Luffy raised me.
“thank you.” “yep gotchyou, alright brot-“ “THANK YOU” 😐 😑 0:23
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is Sakura
Man predicted Uzi diamond head lol
The complex season prospectively like because jeff proximally multiply absent a left napkin. false familiar famous, handsome divorced

This sounds like something Gon would do
Rock Lee is typing....

Naruto, MHA, and Demon slayer be like and also Fairy Tail hahaha
pls stop the CRInge
I screamed shut up when he found his keys
Wow Calebcity finally made a video about fairy tail
bruh this is so annoying... i really just cant stand any motivational speeches, like, i can only barely tolerate those ones that are placed right before the climax, even though those ones at least kinda make sense, but i really just cant stand any of them, im just there the whole time, "can we progress the plot please? hello? helloooo?"
People are sleep at 3am? 🤔
They does really be like that tho
Caleb's neighbors 2:00
We need a part 2
"YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAL"

The gasp when he opens the drawer is too accurate. I’m currently laying in my grave from my death. Cause of death; Lmao
Protagonist in every anime ever be like:
Deku in a nutshell
0:26 that reaction killed me 😂😂😂
Haha, this is a great example of toxic positivity.
Imagine the cringe if thaf happens in real life.
Just made me realise I'd hate every anime character irl
So basically Izuku
I just love the thought of the neighbors hearing him scream "YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAAAL" over and over again and were mad confused but slightly motivated
This time instead of it ending with a meltdown, it ended with Caleb reacting TO his own meltdown 😆  The creativity never ends 😂
relatable
Damn, you must really like anime
Caleb you can't just upload a full episode of RWBY like this. You're gonna get a copyright strike.
kamina is the only character that does this and actually works
This is a super funny anime bit yo😂 and here I thought I've seen every anime skit imaginable, that was unexpected😂
when your a side character that's better than the main character
Gon and Deku vibes
U
I play this to feel motivated.
Shounen anime side characters be like:
This is how Gon and Killua be like all the time LOL
You're exceptionAAALL  Caleb: SHUT UUUUPP
My hero vibes
Deku?
POV: you’re E X C E P T I O N A L
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Oohhh do this is the live action version of mha
As soon as he found his keys and started talking I automatically had My hero In my mind lmao, NO BODY WANTS A WHOLE SPEECH AFTER THROWING ONE PUNCH, that’s one of the key reasons why ppl stop watching my hero

Haikyuu in a nutshell
What scenes do you see a protagonist talking to themselves while in their sleep
Lmao. This is the hardest I laughed in months
Erza?
Naruto be like:
Naruto:
Did someone say season 1 Ash Ketchum?
deku this you?
Cmon Eren and Armin
Why are you wearing a hat with the logo for totino dorito fortnite training compound cult though
XD
Erne jaeger 🤣
Geez this is soo relatable to naruto
This is exactly what happened when the main character somehow motivates random characters in the tournament arc
It’s ok you can say Deku

The Naruto🍥🍜🥡 series is typing.............

my hero
I just laughed so hard, and I haven't laughed like this for a long time. 🤣🤣🤣
Mha
NOO I MADE A JOKE BUT WHY IS THIS ACTUALLY DEKU😭😭😭
Nobody: deku.
So humble he used his omnipotence to locate the keys and let a kid win on the game and did a genuine reaction over the mic to make the kid feel good and he won’t even accept the praise he deserves
👇🏾
naruto
"You're not trash you're exceptional" got me dead
One piece characters be like:
Alternative Title: *Izuku Midoriya every time All Might exists near him*
Oh wow I feel attacked with the second clip 😳 When my hubby talks trash about himself while in a video game, I always give him that speech.... oops
Naruto all the way 😂😂😂
Rean Schwarzer.
Yo
no one: naruto: talk no jutus
Deku much?
If u had the power to read minds and peeked into mine, this is all u would hear
No one:            Midoryia: “gives his other motivational speech for the 103,132,021 time”
I started laughing so much when he screamed 'YOU'RE NOT TRASH!" and then I started cry laughing when he talk in his sleep.
Thanks for the laughter I just wanna let you know that if you believe in your heart and confess in mouth Jesus is lord with a prayer you will go to heaven pls this will save you😁
Ahem. The first skit is Naruto and and Sasuke when Naruto cut his hand
I’d literally become the villain of the anime and have a grudge against him if he was my friend and did this 😂😂😂
00:40 pretty sure that's a one piece reference
All I here is Deku talking to Bakugo...
Everyone talking about how weird his fried was but not on the fact that they share the same house.
YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAAAAAL
Was expecting a baseball bat in the end...
Asta
This is so accurate it makes me wanna cry
“And its all started in keys”
I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone get mad at compliments
"mom, the neighbor guy is having a breakdown again"
Caleb:  anime characters that turn everything into a motivational speech all Shonen anime MCs: yeah you right you right Goku: I am not shown qwq
Saitama be like:
*You're not trassshhhhh!* *Man, SHUT UP*
Bruh, who knows where I can get that big ass fox??
Makoto Naegi : *hope noises*
Can't even make it through the video, I'm laughing so hard. 🤣
why did i helped himmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
So basically naruto and deku
Thank you, you have thought me how to communicate using talk no jutsu, so I will motivate others around me.
Imagine having a friend like this
The way this is deku from my hero academia and like 18 different naruto characters
Lmaooooooooooo!!!!!
_Always keeping your head down when speaking motivational shit_  Even cyberpunk doesn't have this level of detail 😂
So no your not trash that part made me laugh
Deku in a nutshell🤣

The first motivational speech actually got me emotional
Bruh you think of the best shit

Genos in a nutshell
that THANK U after the small thank u was so so on the mark
And that's my nindo my ninja way 😭😂😂
Anime side characters be like:
YOURE EXCEPTIONAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLL
Man I would've knocked him clean out if they did that
plot twist: originally he responded to these speeches happily, but the other guy has done them every 30 minutes since they met, so hes just over it
"TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAAAAAAID" That's dead ass me when my friends say anything bad about themselves
Literally every fight naruto gets into.
Ash catchem vibes on that first one Lmgdaoooooooo
LOL
"i had already found a good friend "  and u, u are such a good friend Me: Hunter x hunter vibes
I feel like this happens to me I’m them both the one who makes the motivational speech and the friend I’m always in that position
Deku much???
Dude he Sounds so much like luffy when he hits that yell 😂😂😂
I hate that I seen this just now because when he put the hat down I felt it so hard
Deku
Ezal from Friday: (crying and screaming at midnight) Calebcity: (looking at camera pissed off)

Thank you for the laughs, you deserve all your success!
Thank you ! 😹😹😹😹💀💀💀
Special shoutout to izuku midoriya

A lot of complements are good, But too much compliments will make me annoyed as hell.
Lmao so true
this is my mom when I say anything bad about myself on the game
And then people say they wish anime was real
Armin in aot 😭😭
Caleb looks like Junpai from Persona 3
Idk why you upset that's the kinda positive reinforcement I require in my life rn
PLEASE JUST SAY DEKU
Your best skit so far
At the beginning he actually sounds like a normal person lol
He just summed up naruto in less than 5 mins
Deku in a nutshell

Genos type beat
I've never watched anime, but this vid is hilarious 😂
the fact that he even gets exactly how the english dubs sound as well. perfect intonation
So the anti-Zuko season 1?

Guy 2: "You may have fallen" *cue motivational music* Guy 1: "Yo where is this music coming from?" Guy 2: "But you should always get up! Never give up!" Guy 1: "I just fell, of course I'll get up... wtf is wrong with you man?" Guy 2: "Always believe in yourself. It doesn't matter how many times you fall, it matters most how many times you rise up!" Guy 1: "I only fell over something, no need for this speech. Dang bro... why do I hang out with you?"
Almight
Gon💚 typing...
This was so funny
TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAAAAAAID
1:26 sakura talking to naruto
Eren when his friends came to save him in the underground city.
Did you mean: Katara  *Or every character from Haikyuu*
These video’s are sooooo short     But it must take a whole ass day to think of an idea and write the script  And another whole ass day to record it And ANOTHER WHOLE ASS DAY TO EDIT IT       So I appreciate the hard work
This is really cheesy when they do this😭🤣🤣🤣
This gives me mad Deku vibes 😂😂

1:10 me trying to hype my friends up tho
2:27 THAT FACE THO 🤣🤣
Naruto has entered the chat
GOD DAMN he reeks of THEATER KID
This reminds of how in My Hero Academia they make a big deal out of nothing
I'm like this Irl qwq
This is motherfucking Naruto dude

Damn, which Naruto episode is this?

Kutti ka bacha
the way this man caleb looked at the camera scared the shit out of me LMAO
vivi one piece
''I'm not even gonna name specific anime characters, but I hate them'' name them NAME THEM
Nobody : Ymir to Historia :
Sasuke after Naruto Shippuden
%100 accuracy
😂😂😂😂😂
the thank you at the ending should have been another emotional speech where you suddenly put your black cap on and start crying again
He must of laughed so much while filming this
that one anime character that turns everything into a motivational speech:     Izuku Midoriya: 👁 👄 👁
1:10 That reaction was so real it's scary
This man is practicing his talk no jutsu. 😂😂😂
he really rocking the 100thieves cap i fw it
Literally just Asta from the first few episodes
😭😭🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
That look dead into the camera at the end sent me 😂
no wonder Bakugou hates Deku
Every single sports anime 🤧
why have i known somebody like this
This is mos def luffy😂😂
Was I the only one who would look the the left side of the screen and then look back at him when he looked the the camera..? No..? ok..
Deku and Kacchan lol
I like how he looks at the camera, thinking. Man this is what I have to deal with on a daily basis. But then come to realize that he just records all the scene myself. Man this guy acting is amazing. How you can be done with someone shit if there is no one, just yourself.
This hit me hard!!! The acting is on point 👌
I started anime 1 month ago now i understand every thing by seeing again
Title: Anime characters who turn everything into a motivational speech. Real Title: Haikyu!!
I had a hard time getting through the video due to CRINGE
Naruto?
Everybody: laughs at video Me: wondering what his neighbors think of the screaming😂
I always die with this video 💀😂😂
*shonen anime
It's okay you can say Dek-

Bakugou and Midoriya
College freshmens after attending seminars:

Calsium is important

cue the tears streaming down the face drool and spittle flying  wiping tears with the center of their forearms  face pointing down 45 degrees
Caleb filming the video: "YOUR NOT TRASH!!!!!!" Neighbors: "Oh my god, what does that guy do in his House all day.."
This is literally My Hero Academia
1:11   Me @ my friends 24/7
yo what about your neighbors
Deku, this you?
I'm DEAD 1:33
Black Naruto?
Ok but I literally have full on conversations and debates with my self out loud like I'm talking to some one else. I'll explain terms and plots of shows/books to my self out loud even though I already know. My family used to freak out thinking someone was with me all the time. I'm pretty sure they thought I was possessed at one point
Why was the first one literally an excerpt from haikyuu
Big deku vibes

YOURE EXCEPTIONALLLLL 😣😣😣😣 TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAIDDDDD😫😫😫😫😫 TAKE IT BAAAAAA-😩😩😩😩
I’m not gonna lie... I drop animes cuz of this.
Izuku Midoriya be like:
But the real keys we needed to find were the friends we made along the way
I fot a question how many clothes does he have? Like outfits and carp like dang
His face when he yelled thank you the second time had me dead!
What anime scene is this from? I'm interested

Dude summarised the entirety of Naruto
naruto shippuden:
This is actually a medical condition where that patient who have it talk to themselves or to someone else about some unnecessary thing, doesn't need to be motivational, whether they're awake or asleep. That what people call Madness and beeing crazy or an anime character.
1:11 that definitely attack on titan eren talks to armin im i right?
I love that this is set up as what would happen if it was real life.
TAKE IT BAÀAAAAAAAAAAQCK

MHA season 3 summarized

Side story: they stopped being friends after 2 minutes of the speeches
Naruto be like:
Bro the figure is missing the mustache and beard. Also I didn't see any ash on the character. I want Ashy characters.
I know you didn't want to pin this down to a single show, but the fact that there was no "SASUKE!!!!" left a void in this skit and my heart.
Bro does he have neighbors
he was so done he broke the 4th wall
"I think It's going to rain"
Bet you won’t like this comment
Ok Deku/Asta
at that point i would have smacked that anime character
THE FACT THAT THIS IS SO REAL LMFAO
Mahn ur killing me

I like how he doesn't even have to rely on his god tier editing skills people will just watch him yell for 3 minutes
This is Naruto I swear why is this guy telling us the story of Naruto
Lmfao, they really do be doing that in anime.
Seven Deadly Sins All Day 🤣🤣

Erwin smith
"I farted and shit came out, thats why *sniff sniff* you gotta stay determined. you gotta try, never give up.
The video game part reminded me of how I feel sometimes when I play league of legends LOL  And my little sister used to pep talk me when I would negative self-talk myself while playing. She's adorable, she's good at Instagram but I don't know if she would be comfortable with me advertising for her. She's in middle School and she chose the polar opposite musical instrument of me: the string bass. She's doing well at it and for mother's day this year we got a group of our family together and did a little orchestra performance outside of our grandmother's window. We recorded it and I think I'm going to upload it as long as I get permission from my siblings.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
caleb's friend: YOUR EXEPTIONAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALL caleb: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH COME ON I'M ON THE GAME
Yup he has mental breakdown 😂
His neighbors must think he is insane lol
Lowkey we need to yell to ourselves that we are exceptional and we aint trash.

HxH in a nutshell 😂
I was just watching ousama game yesterday when this happened. This weird motivational speech thing seems to be apart of anime culture.
That friend that’s too down for you if he watched anime
Everybody’s gansta til they just make a skit that’s acts like deku making speech’s when not nessary
Deku has entered the chat
He really didn't think I'd know that he used direct clips from My Hero?
I’ve never laughed so hard
This is what you show someone when they ask what is my hero like.
Is he wearing a 100 thieves hat
When you tell exceptional, I’ll I can think about is the ant farm theme song
This is the truest thing I've ever seen in my LIFE!!! FAAAAAACCCCCCTTTTTSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is like anime if it was realistic
Lol the ending music gives me nostalgia now
I had a anime add with a motivational speech when I tried to play this video *WHAT*
Accurateeeeee
you're not traaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaash !!!!!!!! omfg XD
Me: *sees title* Also me: "so a mom?"
Is this way.
😂😂😂😂😂
It would've been nice if the screen slowly faded to gray near the end when you were just blankly staring.
I only wonder how long it took to make speeches out of this stuff?
This is deku from my hero academia
My brother does this everytime he’s angry at someone
In the words of every main character from a 2000 to 2010 this nigga spit in

Deku when he got his quirk from all might.
The keys have a secret meaning behind them. They have been passed down from his ancestors and now it’s his turn to guard them. Only the worthy can find them and unleash their ancient powers.
No one:  Deku:
Midoriya
bro idk why i thought of maka fighting the keshin soul. she did all that cool shit before just end up beating homeboy with a speech about bravery LIKE DUDE I DONT CARE.
I know someone that os exactly like the anime guy and it makes me so uncomfortable bruh
This physically angered me and im not even there
That’s basically every Naruto/Sasuke scene
I feel bad for anyone who’s had to listen to these speeches with no skip button
Hahahah this is great
Discord mods when the 14 year old emo girl says she is ugly.
It’s just keys damn 😂
This feels a bit too much like a villain’s origin-story
Me: I know I’m better then you guys at smash bros but I’d be trash if I go to tournaments”  All my friends: “YOU’RE NOOOT TRRAAAAASSSSH!!! THAT IT BACK!!!!”

The “That’s right, I can do this” had me dying the way he said it while sleeping 😂
any time this stuff happens in anime/manga I just skip. this cuts almost anything I've ever read or seen in half I don't no what the mangaka/screenwriters are thinking when they write this stuff but this takes up way too much time.
Nobody:  My Hero Academia:
I always forget that this is only one person
Too bad, caleb, you’re awful at motivational speeches Lmao
When he said, “your such a good friend” I thought I had a friend,.
How to be Deku 101
I need someone to animate this

Ok naruto keep  calm and stop harassing pervi sage
Deku thanking 10 people before throwing a fucking punch
Now we just need "Anime Characters that always have a discouraging roast speech"
Jim Halpert has NOTHING on Calebs *stare into the camera* face.
This screams OP characters
*luffy in a nutshell*
Dear young Black Men you’re valued!  https://youtu.be/zWN8zV1Pzww
THANK YOU!!!!!  O 0 _
I dont even watch anime but this is still a riot
i wonder what his neighbours would be thinking while he was screaming
This is what the side characters have to go through.
I wonder what his neighbors might think whenever they pass by and hear him screaming lol.

I literally almost cried at the first one, and I *never cry.* *_Brooooooooo_*
Why I stopped watching naruto.

Naruto in a nutshell
its amazing how this guy made a living by just talking to himself
This should be called a day in the life living With a anime character
CESAAAAAARRRRR
Naruto rn 👨‍🦯👨‍🦯
The fact that he still wears his cap after getting out of his bed
The definition of deku.
This video conveys emotions that haven't beem invented yet.
That cultural aspect of being overtly indebted to people has got to be rough on Japanese people. It's so bad, it's in anime.
Mha be like
Caleb do you have sasukes sword
how many bags u got my guy u good you need some sleep 0:43
Am I the only one looking for anime’s we’re the MC sounds like this?

Why didnt he just strangle him at the end
The cap down thing reminds me of Pokemon so much bruh
" Damn!" You know you've gotten on Caleb's nerves if he used a swear word 😂. I just realized he rarely uses profanity in his videos. Either that, or I'm just now noticing 🤔

When done, Professor McC. turned and looked at the class and said: “ This is the expression as written in John David Jackson’s textbook. It’s wrong. Here is the correct equation”. He then walked to the two blackboards at the side of the classroom and filled them both up, taking up the remaining half-hour (or less) of class time. He then turned to face the class, most of whom had been diligently copying both lengthy expressions, beaming and rocking on his heels. Before he could ask if there were any questions, one student raised his hand, and stated, then afterward asked…. “Gee, Professor McC. I bet you spent all night figuring that out!” When he was answered “Why, yes, I did!” (The Professor still beaming)…..the student replied… “Don’t you have a wife or something?":     Legit the chances of you answering this without searching it up; "sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) +e^(i*pi) = 0":     Legit the chances of someone actually seeing this:     T⍑ᒷ ᓵ⍑ᔑリᓵᒷᓭ ℸ ̣ ⍑ᔑℸ ̣  ᓭ𝙹ᒲᒷ𝙹リᒷ ↸╎↸リ'ℸ ̣  ⚍ᓭᒷ ᔑ ℸ ̣ ∷ᔑリᓭꖎᔑℸ ̣ 𝙹∷ ℸ ̣ 𝙹 ℸ ̣ ∷ᔑリᓭꖎᔑℸ ̣ ᒷ ℸ ̣ ⍑╎ᓭ:      Non ad transferendum quod aliquis translator sit casus nobisque per Latine:     Legit the chances of someone using this for no reason:     Txoj kev muaj feem ntawm ib tug neeg tsis siv tus txhais lus los txhais qhov no:     Amathuba omntu ongasebenzisi toliki ukuguqula le nto:     Legit the chances of me being pansexual:     Legit the number of kids that want to actually go to school instead of saying they hate school because they think it'll hurt the teacher:     Legit the number of people who for some reason read this far:     Legit the number of weebs in North Korea:     Legit the percentage of WWIII to actually happen:     Legit the people who get an alien from Area 51 on September 20, 2019:     Legit the time I take to think of these things:     Legit no one on Earth:     Legit no one in the entire universe:                                                                                                                                                                                             *Boku No Pico best anime*

Deku IRL
Wait Caleb is that you. We went to school together Caleb Glass right?
:deku
2:10 is this the Yugioh dub? Flash backs
Noruto and Bnha in a nutshell be like :
Midoria
I love that he doesn’t really have clickbait
TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAAAAAAAAIID
I love where in his every video the top comments always starts with "I love how, like how and then makes a pop culture reference"
*cough*deku*cough*
you should honestly make a movie
Nobody:  My parents when they see me acting depressed: 1:10
Calebs Friends : You are not trash  Long beach griffys friends : you are trash i hope you step on a lego
This is the same energy of some YouTube commenters sucking off their favorite YouTubers
Sup. Here’s a nice video idea  *When the boss constantly uses a move you can’t dodge*
This is literally Izuku and Katsuki’s relationship lol
this is basically naruto's talk no jutsu scripts lol
When you're talking to a cancer
1:39 me when some one yelling at each other at my house.
Deku made me not want to watch the show
How you end the video with a motivational speech
When you have a good friend 1:15
Sakura be like:
This reminds me of one piece 😭😭
Yo, this guy binges too many shounen. I’ve been there, it’s an interesting place to be
You know the skit is good when you actually get second hand embarrassment from it
That second one was something people would do in real life around jr high, ultimate cringe
So much calebs they goin make calebcity Tube
Deku every five seconds
I CAN'T BRO YOU GET ME EVERY TIME    I love you so much man
He wearing A hat so it can cover  his eyes
Me when I forget to do my school work and my best friend does it for me:
The keys are a metaphor
Bruh this is naruto
I love how he literally looked at the camera.   "You see this? you see this right here?"
I laughed hard when he was looking in the cam 😂
*Ahem* Deku.
Every video he make..... it is either too quiet or too loud during the span of the video. Have to vol up everytime he's talking to himself and have to volume down everytime he said "No. Why and Get outttt"  Still funneh tho
Midoriya100
“YOURE EXCEPTIONAAAAAAAALLL- i was dyinnnnn
At 4 million Caleb should show us his clone-making machine
i feel so called out jfdhdfgk i'm just trynna be nice but what if i'm turning into a motivational shounen lead _oh no_ lmao
Naruto in a nutshell.
This is bakugou and deku 100%
this is basically naruto whenever someone talks bad about  selves lol
2:05 sounds like Yugi Mutou from yu-gi-oh!
Actually Deku
Is it just me or does he look like Damian lilord
Have you seen that car commercial that looks like it's a skit you would make?
bakugo and deku

The reason I can’t watch my hero academia in one video
Man is that mom that exactly where everything is

Caleb doing his skits His neighbors: Wtf is he insane or something?
I kid you not I have that exact same plaid blanket on me right now... from Wally Marty...
Alternative title: boku no hero in 3 minutes
That camera stare was fucking hilarious
I see the Calebcity cinematic universe is getting more intense
Deku :
😂😂😂 Bruh when he woke up out his sleep to give that speech 3:18 in the morning.... "What my uncle tell me again..." 🤣
Korosensei when teaching his students a lesson 😂
Every time giorno is on screen:

deku
This is literally Talk no jutsu in Naruto.
i just realised he’s called Caleb City, cuz it’s a city, of calebs  I’m getting replies saying that I have copied this comment from someone else, i haven’t seen anyone with a similar comment to mine, it would be pure coincidence, also thank you for all the likes that this comment has gotten.  finally came back to this after 4 months and DAMN, OVER 1K LIKES WTH
Naruto not realizing this is the reason Sasuke left.
*Dramatic Exhale*
Thank you Aye no proble.... 🗣THANK YOU!!  👀
Midoriya?
He must have said:- "  Yeah, I am not trash,you are."  GeTTTTTT OOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUTTTT!!!!

My hero academia in a nutshell 😭
Alternate title: Deku after every L in a nutshell
Looooool reminds me of Naruto and Sasuke looool

“You’re exceptional!”
When you realise, your parents are anime in disguise..

TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAID!
A.K.A everyones younger cousin
Imagine being his neighbor
This dude's feet are GIGANTIC 1:54
Imagine his neighbours hearing this. Neighbour: Damn he’s very self motivated, but DAMN GO TO SLEEP
This is why bakugo hates midorya-
Lmao this is Deku af!!
You don't have to thank us for supporting you, isn't that *pause*   what friends are really for? *Slams fist on wall*  All along you have been supporting us. Through 2020, we some how made it this far, because of you.  And what have we done, simply liked? SHARED? SUBSCRIBED?! We were so scared, and you took care of us all.  Anatawa HERO desu! Dakara....ARIGATOGOZAIMASU!
So this is how bakugo feels about deku
If calebcity was my teacher I would never miss a day of school
I hate anime 4 this lmao i weak
1:12 Best part
He said covering for me and shortcomings that's when I knew it was legit
The accuracy in that video blows me away
Yo I'm sure I've seen anime before.
I completely lost it when he said  “YOUR NOT TRAAAAASSH”  and then when he said “SHUT UP”  1:33
Poor guy gets stuck with the dumb useless best friend anime character and not the overpowered cool protagonist
I promise I will watch more Caleb videos.I will try to be better dude.I don't want to get more Baggy eyes anymore.Take rest
Lord i was cry laughing the entire time
THis is my hero acedmia
If i could get it i would im sorry tho cause if i bye it my mom will get mad at me.

啊这啊这
Can you make a super human intervirew 3 pls
soooo naruto then
Why does the title say only Gurran lagann
Caleb you're so funny. THIS IS SO TRUE.
if that happened to me I would put him in a TIME LOOP
He should make one where he plays a game and he has choices but he closes the game and the game characters are like wtf man
You know I feel like he seen this or this actually happen to him which is bizarre
He broke the fourth wall 😯
I really want that big fox plushie I'm ngl
*[Insert Naruto joke here]*
Why'd I get mad Naruto vibes from this whole video? lol
the sleep motivational speech happens in every single anime. someone has a dream and its about the past or something they cry cause that person leaves or died *wakes up* says they had a bad dream and no one here can tell me its wrong
I swear to god this is Genos
So mha?
Deku from my hero
Ak that happens in ever anime
useless anime girls be like
Quite interesting how you realize this is literally what you've watched and enjoyed for many series to go back and question yourself... Maybe it's just the human adaptation that makes it weird...
This guy should be getting 60 million views a day
armin
This might be my favorite one so far.
Hahahaha
1:10 he is really annoying.
Caleb: why u always screaming.  Dbs fans: KKKKKKKAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAMEEEEEEEEEEHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

yo you missed a big opportunity when you didn't have key guy say "you're they key to my heart"
You did 1 task for him and all of a sudden you're his "big brother"
relatable
Plot twist: He's not really a good friend. The other guy's just been through a hard life and this is the first friend he's ever made.  If you liked that, donate $1 on Cashapp at $cherrybomb2194
For some reason I actually almost cried when Caleb started yelling for the first part, cause it kinda felt like he was talking to me lol
I started laughing so hard
This is so freaking accurate! 😂
That one piece vibe
Gon  Hunter X Hunter
the fact its annoying me so much its a good video
The accuracy 😂😂😂
Now I know how anime brothers feel when they live with their main character brother
Yeah then the dude turns to be a badguy and makes a speech how he thought I was your friend
I could barely watch this video I was cringing the whole time XD
Sounds a lot like naruto
"I PROMISE I'LL DO BETTER" 😂
I want this in a Japanese dub
Genos and saitama
“I’ll succeed! I HAVE to!” why did I lose it at that part 💀
The yelling was too funny xD
14 year olds.
His neighbor GONNA call the police from all that screaming
Naruto
That look into the camera at the end was a mood lmao
lol one piece in a nut shell
Him yelling at 3 am into the couch actually had me fucking wheezing
PLEASE.. MISS ONCEE
His friend reminded me of Armin from aot
Anime characters: motivational even in their sleep
Friend 1: hey wanna play hitman? Friend 2: sure Friend 2:how do I crouch? Friend 1: press B Friend: THANK YOU YOU ARE THE BEST PERSON EVER YOU NEVER HURT ANYONE YOU ARE THE BEST FRIEND I EVER HAD YOU SHOULD BE PRESIDENT WITHOUT YOU I WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE YOU ARE MORE KIND THAN MY MOM I PROMISE I WILL DO BETTER YOU ARE A KING YOU ARE THE BEST I WILL KILL ANYONE WHO DARES TO MAKE FUN OF YOU I WILL SELL MY SOUL TO THE DEVIL JUST FOR YOUR SAFTEY CAUSE YOU ARE THE BEST PERSON EVER!

Would've been EPIC if Caleb did long beach griffey's "I'm goin home" at 02:23  Lmao

Imagine having a friend who loved you like this.
Moral of the story: YOU'RE EXCEPTIONALLLLLL

Sakura liked this video
I should not be laughing this hard 😂😂😂
How did he post a whole episode of naruto without getting copyrighted
Damn 490 people accidentally hit the dislike button oof
That level of cringe....... 🥴
that look
1:54 He slept with his hat on.
This is so true it’s annoying. Makes me anime is made for teenagers only.
Only missing the tears bro. ...eeehhh... And "Senpai".
Now I know how Bakugo feels
WHEN A POISONOUS SNAKE BITES YOUR FRIENDS ASS ND U HAV TO SUCK THE POISON OUT

at 0:26 i cant stop looking at his reaction. its so hilarious.
2:09 *Silence* Hahahahjahahahahaha
That’s every anime ever, like Saitama is the only person that is literally like the guy that helped with the keys
Genos vs satiama
I love you
Bruh using his hat and trying to *Shadow his head like in anime when talking
Deku's life story in one vid
This man posted Deku in a nutshell.
Every goddamn character in bnha
0:45 Alright thank you-  *THANK YOUUUUU*  DAYUM
Pov. 2:11 What deku's mom here's all night
I love how normal he acts at first, but the second he finds the keys he becomes Midoriya
Definitely a MHA skit
This is why (one punch man) has the greatest main character
Midoriya and All might in a nutshell
Deku in a nutshell
I cry when this happens in anime  But I couldn't stop laughing 😂 ✌
I wonder how your neighbors were like when you were screaming at yourself lol
Yo Caleb I got an mech idea you know how you say wha-How that can be put on your on a shirt I’m not a bot either bro 😀
What it this one piece
When I tell you im crying- when you looked at the audience I DIED.
This is why I hate deku
1:01 me
rock lee
100 thieves....when did that happen Caleb?
Someone giving me a compliment: 1:38 Me screaming on the inside, wanting to burst with joy: 1:39 Me on the outside: Umm thnx hehe 😬
Maybe the real key was inside us all along..
1:15 When the episode is getting good but then the main character starts having flashbacks
Friend: "You should watch My hero, trust me you wont regret it!"     Me after listening to deku cry for 4 seasons straight: 2:23
Lmao he got it all right
this nigga just made me laugh till i got abs😭😭😭
When he has his cap covering his I lost it. YOURE EXCEPTIONAL 😂😂
Reminds me of Genos to Saitama
Black comedy without swearing or N-words?
its just keys man...                          *T H A N K   Y O U! I ... PROMISE  ill do BETTER... i PROMISE!*
LOLOL
at 2:25 he breaks the 4th wall
Bruh, why did that 1st speech HIT tho 😭
#WhenAnimegetsTOOREAL  😆👏
1:40 Why does it look like he's about to start crying 😂
YOU'RE NOT TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!
I got idea for next: anime characters that talk themselves out of a fight when they know they would lose
now when I get upset at games I imagine CalebCity yelling at how exceptional I am
This is my boy Rock Lee 100%
Caleb got so annoyed with the motivational speech that he broke the 4th wall. 2:24
LOOOOL the scream at 1:40
That yell cry at the end had me!! hahaha
That so sad
That so sad
"YOU'RE NOT TRAAAASH!" "SHUT UP!" "YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAAAAAAL" "AAAAAAAAAAAA" This is gold lmao
covering for my mistakes, my short comings that was hilarious
I haven’t watched anime since Pokemon like 15 years ago and I still know this is accurate
bruh
This guy literally hasn't aged since vine
This is legit the funniest thing you've ever done lol
This is just like  anime, man anime sucks
Yo witch episode of jojo is this?
This is probably the reason why bakugo hates deku 💀
i love ur videos man 🤍
Kakashi: *trying to bring obito back to his senses* Obito : look I have nothing in my heart-  Me: I-
That's what I'm saying I hate when anime characters make a speech about anything you can stub your toe on anything and there's the main character coming literally out of nowhere  saying this exact line "no I won't let in end like this" that line makes me fill tingley inside
والله يلا فكرتني بروحي نكمك
The best part is how they’re always screaming during the speeches.
fairy tale
This is just real lool
soundproof ur place, tch
Bruhh this Hinata from haikyuu
Narutos talk no jutsu be like
Wow....i thought i was the only one who thought this when i watched anime.....also is there any anime tht isnt cringy honestly...every anime i watch i have to pause so i can face palm myself and say pls stop
I'm hollin'🤣 bc it's conveniently funny
My no talk jutsu is effective!
2:23 when he looked at the camera I had to pause and calm down,, anyway this was funny af
U Danny af man
its just keys......
YOUR EXCEPTIONAL
LMFAON
AND THANKS FOR MAKES US LAUGH AND FORGET OUR SAD LIFE :(
0:27 That face really screams "This is what I deal with everyday"
Such a motivational speach
Friend “”Offers to buy me food” Me—0:19
🤣🤣🤣 I’m so dead 💀
One of the reasons why i quit watching Anime..
Are We Going To Talk About how this man is really talking to himself
*Today's episode of "My Weird Roommate" starring (Caleb)*
Accurate
whoever disliked this video is dumb
This video describes Deku perfectly.
Yo Ik this sounds like I’m asking for a lot but who wants to see 10 min skit like those Kyle exum skits
Alternative title: rock lee in a nutshell
DEKU
1:40 that yell back was so damn perfect
"Take back what you saaidddd"🤣🤣🤣
When the piano music comes on we know he has once again descended more into pit of sorrow...
Believe it 0/
B BR BRU BRUH BRU BR B BR BRU BRUH BRU BR B BR BRU BRUH BRU BR B BR BRU BRUH BRU BR B LETS...MAKE...A...BRUH........BrUh ⛓
Imagine he can make clones...😳😳😳
Caleb is my favorite YouTuber bruh
Deku in a nutshell
Damn I was waiting for him to go over there and fold him
Yo somebody get Izuku a napkin before he floods the house with his tears
That's why I can't stand watching Re:zero
That’s an awfully hot coffee pot
Sad thing is in the States we think showing feelings like this is corny or lame. Ik the skit is over exaggerating, but showing love needs to be normalized
whyd this video make me cry
This be the cringest part of the episodes
YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAAAAALLL
Next episode: when you discover your weak ass friend who’s shit at everything and waaay too attached to you is the main character  Caleb: right imma start planning my funeral
1 out of every 10 Naruto characters is like this
And people ask me why I find Naruto so cringe at times.
his videos always do well
MHA Fans Punching The Air rn
It's the looking at the camera for me
Bruh this is just me on a daily basis
WE NEED SUPERHUMAN INTERVIEW 3!!
Why is this so actuate
This is the only the reason why i dont like anime
Better scramble like an egg for you get folded like an omelet n****
The example are "One piece and dragon ball " : overly dramatic characters that cry gallons of tears, characters so stupid and soo detached from reality .  This why I watch animes like ghost in the shell, gantz, monster,  ect
Why is this so accurate lmao
chills
Next video idea: back seat gaming, watching someone play a game you beat and they doo doo at it
Bro this is just tenya 🤣🤣
*Your*   -Execpetional-
my mom lmao
Bro this is so accurate af
Calebs neighbors at 3 am I CAN SLEEP!
Us: YOUR NOT TRASSHHHH CALEB: MAN IF YOU DONT SHUT THE HELL UP LEMME HIT YOU WITH A BAT, A THICK SWORD THAT CANT HIT A PERSON OR KILL, AND A GLASS OF WATER
Hehe haha yeah some anime characters can be like that 🤣
Lmaooooo
You can literally hear the words "ah sh** here we go again" in his face 0:26
_Meanwhile_ Sakuragi Hanumanichi is laying his whole crew out like Steven Adams in the paint. And they're both still on that *don't believe in yourself-- believe in the me that believes in you!* jons  *_The Power Is Yours!_*
Hahaha one of the best ones yet
😂😂
man dont look at me like that i dont know what to do either lol
YOU'RE NOT TRASH YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAL, TAKE IT BACK
I always walk out the room when a scene like this appears      Also I think he's covering his face with his cap because he's not actually crying
The end 😂😂
💀
it would be sweet if he said Believeeee IT !!!!!!!
You are the only youtuber that can genuinely make me laugh :)
*cough* dEkU *cough* hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
this reminds me a lot of naruto
Alternative title: Things side characters say
Naruto be like: YOUR NOT TRASH.....YOUR EXCEPTIONAL
I just started doing short videos! Im going to be up there with you one!
Lmao
Bro the accuracy is scary 😂😂😂😂
Kakashi 👀
I thought I was early but there is 10k comments...
This is why All Might gave his quirk to Deku not Mirio.
😂😂😂
Let's go my boi calebcity
Friend: Hey bro want some chips? Me: 0:40
Anyone else do 10sec skips when stuff like this happens
Korosenai From Assassination Classroom or Nagsia 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You should make a video about people who pour the milk before the cereal
Can't stop laughing.  But why his feet look like 2005 World of Warcraft block textures lmao?
mha and aot
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!! THEY'RE SO EXCEPTIONALLY FUNNYYY! THANK YOU! THAAANK YOOOUUU!!!!!!

Caleb make more videos like the "if a drug dealer was in a musical" literally the best video in the world
YOU'RE MY FRIEEENND
I lost my shit when the dude was crying into his pillow
I died on the last part. Yes, you just read a ghost's comment. 💀
IT'S OKEY.. , SAITAMA
I love how this is under the Anime section on the Home page
I feel like this is a MHA skit
IM DEAD IT SO TRUE
Most of the audience of these anime are so detached from reality that these speeches are actually motivating to them. I can't recall many anime that reach the height of motivation in DBZ.
naruto , this sums up the entirety of naruto
Fruit basket if u know it u know it
Did you just watch my hero academia?
I want him to make something about the travis Scott Burger
Fairy Tail??
That looked like kakashi Sensei Obama
Dude I just found your channel and bro I can’t stop laughing man really good work bro
the fact that he is not listening to “SHUT UPPPPPPPPPPP”
It's the tears that got me
Icebear has good friends too
imagine what his neighbours are thinking lmao
UUGGGHHH!!!!!!I'M CRINGING SO HARD!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this is to real🤣🤣
its ok, you can say deku
Dope figure bro. You earned it
I stated dying when he told him to “SHUT UPP”
Omg he had my hero academia nailed 😂😂😭😭😭👌 he didmt even have to say it was that show and I already knew😂😂😂
My Man sleep with hat on
The Accuracy.
Was this Asta??
Hey, what's the soundtrack played at 0:29?
Disney is taking notes
These two are the same person...
so I watch a lot of anime and I hate the characters who  are always talking about nothing basically and I watched the entirety of vampire knight and attack on titan so stupid emotional stuff is my thing, man because those two shows are crazy although vampire knight is like a lot of just I don't even know its kinda confusing.
This is like that one kid that looks up to Naruto he is probably gonna do this
Im starting to believe theres really a set of identical twins
Luffy.
this is why I stopped watching boku
100T Caleb?
Dead ass I lost it when you looked directly at the camera
You forgot the part where their eyes disappear and their hair almost covers their eyes.😂
2:59
lmaooo
Facts!!!
That last guy clearly has some sort of trauma in his life. 😂
Thank us for supporting you? Thank you for making such awesome content
its kool its keys
This deku for show
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
When I saw this I immediately thought of My Hero Academia
The fact that this is s true
This dude went full Deku lmao 🤣 😂 💀
How come I see this I think of tanjiro?
Every shounen anime character
Was looking at your other videos and you should make a singing video.
Lowkey Lee and Naruto's relationship I would say guy but he acts the same with Lee
This reminds me of Saitama and Genos
How do we connect @CalebCity with a voice acting gig? Id appreciate caleb in the roster and in some voice credits in my animes from now on.
Good to know Caleb can use talk-no-jutsu
Yo bois I think she pregnant and I’m S-H-I-T-T-I-N-G itttttt
👌
Isn’t that what anime is about..? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
I love your videos so much. The content just captures the viewer to the fullest extent. I truly hope you still make content for many years to come :)
🤣🤣🤣🤣 it’s the second one for me 😂😂😂
We need more vids my dud
That audio cue from re:zero was uncalled for and almost made me cry
YOUR NOT TRASHHHH!! lmao that part got me
This was on point lol
YOOO I LOST IT WHEN HE SCREAMED AT HIM BECAUSE HE DIDN’T KNOW WHAT TO SAY 😂😂😂😂☠️ 1:39
My mom when I ask why i was sent to a new classroom: *YOU ARE EXCEPTIONAL*
When did they make a live action movie to mha and haikyui?
Any anime protagonist ever
1:54 had me on the floOR BRUHHH 😭🤣💀
Yo 😂😂😂
"YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAL!"  *"YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAAALLL!"*  Nailing those very specific terms characters use due to translation.
Maybe the real keys was the friends we made along the way.
This is giving me my hero academia vibes. Maybe it's because caleb is acting like deku😂
This is accurate on a personal level. I'm offended.
Watch my video it’s about any 90s sitcom
Fairy tales 🤣
This is my favorite one yet
Dont say that your not trash your a good person your my friend
Calls himself trash OCD kicks in
God damn
Motivating yourself in your sleep, now that's deep!
From the top make it drop that's so wet that's some wet grab a bucket and a mop that's some wet that's some wet wap wap wap that's some wet thats some wet macaroni in a pot that's so wet that's some wet that's some wet    And he needs some help 😔
I can’t believe he slept with socks on
He didn’t just say the words... his head position was 10/10 on key 😂😂😂     👇 if u hate anime
Bro at least this friend is actually trying to make him feel better
Maan some1 get this guy some friends
Lmfao!!! Not only was the hat and shadow angle on point, but the fact that mans was sleeping on the couch, WITH THE HAT STILL ON!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was literally watching this at the same time you checked the time on the couch scene lol
nobody: naruto after watching this: 👁💧👄💧👁
Okay pack it up midoriya
Anyone: *breaths* Midoriya: THANK YOU FOR CONTINUEING TO DO THAT! ITS AN INSPIRATION TO US AAAAALL!
The Calebs are learning. They broke the forth wall!!
When your friend is too positive.
izuku midoriya be like
That dead expresssion facing the camera, perfect XD You're amazing
*cough fairy tale *cough*
Dude, im laugh crying so bad rn
1:35
He knew what was about to happen cause of the face at 0:27 lmao
1:35
1:35
0:26
The first speech was so dead on 😂
100 thieves really snatching up everyone lol
omg fax
I'm dead at 1:36
Yo it's just keys
On God
I hate this parts
What side character doesn’t know is the main character secretly trying to raise his death flag. Out of a deep rooted inferiority complex.
This fells like one of his classics
Imagine if everyone was like this irl
Me.
“YOUR EXCEPTIONAL!!!!!!” lol 😂
Thanks you!!!!
Bro, the “naruto shrug” while he was crying was priceless
Although his friend has many emotional issues it seems and pressure from his family.
Literally every Fairy tail characters in a nutshell
The dude compliments him and he be like "STOP!"
This is natsu after saving lucy 200 times because she almost died
1:32 is the funniest part 😂🤣😭
Caleb.. why does your drawer not have a handle?
Mumen rider in a nutshell lmao
This should be "Acting like deku for 3 minutes and 8 seconds"
I love it! It's too true XD
be my dad❤
trying some talk no jutsu
Had me laughing man, very funny, very true.
Naruto in a nutshell
This is what goes on in his mind between two different personalities.
This mans basically re-enacted the *ENTIRETY* of My Hero Academia
Him and kyke exum need to do a video together
I'm gonna tell my little cousin he got featured in a caleb city video
Aka midoriya
I know I'm not the only one that paused at them feet. Well they socks, but real real close to feet, it's not just me.
It started with the second "thank you" but that 3rd "thank you" was the straw that broke the camel's back.
He’s cute. 😏
“TAKE IT BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-”
Can anyone explain how he got those camera angles so perfect
Naruto literally
Naruto
@CalebCity do you play genshin impact?
naruto in a nutt shell
Literally, Naruto and Rock Lee
Dear random person who reads this right now. I've been there, we all been there some time in our lives, some moments are better than others with other words. Give yourself time to repair yourself,  i want you to get better. Right now i can't imagine what you're going through but i bet it's a tough time you got right now. Well, being kind towards another has nothing to do with worthiness, but rather necessity, because we all need love and affection, some need it more than others and everyone shows it differently. I want you to feel loved even in the darkest times. Stay strong person out there! Remember that there is always light in the end of the dark tunel. Stay safe, healthy & awesome You're not alone! And NEVER GIVE UP Much love from Nairobi - Kenya <3
Naruto in a Nutshell
Bruhh pose on point 1:11
2:20 are those Caleb's feet?
“Thank you all might”
Can we have the face reveal of the camera man
Might guy and rock lees relationship lmfao
This is why I don't like anime
Dang That’s my mom
Sakura, stop whining and do something useful
thats deku
alternate title: Caleb complimenting and making himself cringe at the same time for give or take 2 minutes and 30 seconds
It’s the fact that the cap is casting a shadow over his face like an anime
The second scene had me in freaking stitches. Such golden comedy. 1:39 He literally just yells back
Ohhh wow too funny.
The next day, he put up an ad saying: looking for new roommate. No motivational speakers. Must be OK with being quiet past 10 p.m.
This is giving me rock lee vibes
*cough *cough naruto *cough
Me already doing this to my friends, trying to be a good person
lmao
you can see in his face how much he does this
After the second thank this man new what was going to happen 😂😂his face was like is this man fr
My Hero kinda be like this
Lool this is too true. Can anyone recommend me an anime that doesn't have this? Cuz I feel like calebcity just spoiled all of them to me!   P.s. please check out my newest skit on RPG games. Lemme know what you think! Cheers!
Hi
Plot Twist: He pre-recorded his speeches and plays them every night at 3:18 AM
I PROMISED I’LL DO BETTER *jeez*
So this is what if deku was black
Deku.
Mako from kill la kill
My face literally crumpled at the first, "THANK YOU" lol
😂😂😂 shots fired!! This is definitely towards that piece of shit of an anime my hero academia
My parents: the skit
😂😂😂😭😭 Brooo this man!!
I wonder if caleb's neighbors are just used to hearing him yell at himself.
that black shirt guy reminds me of mofo deku from my hero academia
THÉ HAT COVERING THE EYES IS FACTSSSS!
You're Exceptional.
I’m NGL the Laat situation be me 💯😂
I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF PEOPLE IN THE COMMENTS CHECKED OUT MY CHANNEL AND GAVE ME SOME CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK ABOUT MY SKITS.  JUST TRYING TO BE LIKE THE GOATS OF THE SCENE
Luffy be like
this is part of the reason why i stopped watching anime lol
If this ain't Naruto, I don't know what is.🙄
it's so acurate it hurts
Saitama: punches a dude Genos:
thats me with my twt friends
1:00 me playing Jump Force
I have been here since 9k or 1mil idk
Damn this video is accurate af it's scary
Anyone here got a notification after 3 days later or it's me
Thw only thing that would've made this better is if at the very end Caleb said "I'm moving out"
Bruh when he said I’m on the game it had me dead that second one was so funny
Also... Anime characters that turn everything into a motivational speech then makes the plot kill that important person...
Luffy when any character dies:
Bruhhh.. Please Collab with @RDCworld
The yelling in his sleep thing got me
I pictured Rock Lee when he did that speech!!🤣😊
naruto in a nutshell
_KEY-dom Hearts_
Dude you are one of the funniest guys on YouTube, I swear.
When you playing both roles so you get to compliment yourself and act modest at the same time
0:29 the moment he said that I cringed so hard
"Oh hey buddy" "THANK YOUUUUUUUU YOU ALWAYS AKNOWLEDGE ME"
Lmfaooo I’d hate a friend like this 😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂 LOOOVVE YOU CAALLEEEEBB   ♥🔥👌
Naruto pretty much
Holy cow shit
It's more cringey than I thought
Caleb: screaming at himself   Neighbors: "Here we go again"
Sounds like seven deadly sins to me
Literally every scene of my hero
Is this why Sasooke left the village?
Not gonna like Calab would make an "EXCEPTIONAL" anime character  like if you agree
Haha I love these videos

Midoriya lookin ass. I hate MHA bro
Is optimus prime included in this? 😆
1:09 that giant fox plushie is too cuuute😭
1:02 you been working out

I gotta say the video almost made me tear up 😢
How do you get those stuffed animals in the back at 1:07 ? No I’m serious.
Can u do more brawlhalla
I really wanted caleb to start screaming 'I am trash!' back at himself lmfao
Gosh that’s so annoying when anime characters do that
Ahem Eren
Ahem Deku...
Watching Black Clover be like.....
This is why I hate MHA.
Yo that's how I sound when I get anxious
Deku💚💫😭 is typing...
Naruto Talk no Jutsu lol
People really be doing this irl tho
Anime has always be taking things more dramatic and more serious about little or some basic stuff, they make that to make anime better.
*Cough cough* YUGIOH
I say big MY HERO ACADEMIA VIBE BROO
Hey guys look it’s ash ketchum
Had me dying 😂😂😂😭
Hey, I'm here for the interview
Villain: *swings sword at hero* Hero: *long-winded speech about everything he believes in and is fighting for* Villain: "dude wtf just fight no one cares"
The end of the scream got me lololol 2:30
I love anime when they tell them to shut up at moments like this..
nah bro, thank you for all this amazing content, you're suck an amazing dude, I'll do better for you, I wont let you down, Everyone wants to be like you because you're such an amazing person
Tenya Iida who?

Yooooo, whered ya get that fox! I MUST have it! A friend as good as you shouldnt habe any trouble point me in the right direction eh?
Them: you're exceptional! Me: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
The only thing that would make this better is if he sprayed some water on his eyes to simulate the stream of tears that accompany the speech
This is basically deli after getting punched by bakugo
YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAL!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just want to know where the big fox (?) plushies are from 🥺😍
🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
I’m not first😔... But one day, I will be. I will train my mind to sync with my notifications until I’m drained, I will train my fingers to be the faster, that way I can one day be first. I can do it. I’m exceptional, and I will one day succeed. If not this time than next time, and if not next time than the time after that. I will not let myself down! I will not give up! I will make you proud!😖 I WILL, one day be remembered as LEONITUS, the first comment🙏🏾
Factsss
The hat’s shadow covering his eyes is the cherry on top
My guy sounding like Midoriya and Naruto combined 😭😭😭
young midorya
100t hat wavy
Caleb, i can see the mark of the stoner in your eyes and can tell you been smoking some weed lol
Dear friend,...         ...we need toilet papers.

Caleb and RDC got the most accurate anime skits on YT😂😂😂 Straight comedy lol
Bruh, Caleb’s playing For Honor.  “I meant to dodge! I’m trash! I hate this game!”
Play more among us
"WHY DO I PLAY THIS GAME, I'M TRASH!" Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to remove the cameras from my house, ok? You hit a little too close.
Why is this on too well
The look he gave to the Camera was like "oh god not again"

2:22 me vs the voices in my head
I don't even watch anime and this shit funny asf
“YOURE NOT TRASHH!!!”  *Wears 💯 Thieves Cap*  Iunnno bro............ He might be........ 🧐

The only problem is. This only works when someone speaks Japanese.
This is how villains are born.
Lmao it’s Sakura like if you hate her and dislike if you hate her
The game cube controller got me😂😂
Anime character: Im here for the interview Caleb: Whats your superpower? Anime character: I can make anything into a motivational speech Caleb:

Isuku Midoria be like:
That be true, tho.
YOUR NOT TRASH!!!!  SHUT UP!!!!!
Is he using an N64 controller around 1:10?
Mood swings be like that.
Anyone notice he's wearing a 100 Thieves hat. Hiko fan?
Mydoria from boku no hero :
King Kaiyo - Melodic Oddwin - 19

Sad Naruto music intensifies
When he said your so exceptional I died cuz anime ppl stay using that word.
Talk no jutsu
I can't believe Disney hasn't copyrighted this video for showing scenes from the Kingdom Hearts games
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Naruto saw this video and low key got butthurt
Daaaaaamn😅🔥❤️
Definitely Asta
It's like when the main character is getting whooped by the villain and is about to catch that final move. And they just be like, "I'm going to be a hero, I can do this, I will make my mother proud." Then the boss music starts and the villain gets beat down.
Bro who aint screaming saskue during the five kage summit
Hinata from haikyuu:
I want to say this is an exaggeration but.....

This video be speaking facts
Feels bad bro someone stole your video https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSHB3guL/ (don’t click if you’re not CalebCity—don’t give this guy views) I told him to stop but then he just became even more of a clown. I tried filling out a TikTok report form but I either need to be you, your employee, or your lawyer which is kinda dumb. Sorry your content got stolen man.
Naruto be like😭
Deku is typing
Death: *Wait a minute, is that the MC’s ode to a friend? More souls for me.*

Guy sensei in a nutshell

"When your friends are TOO down for you part 2"
This is hilarious
When u been subbed for 3 years
Man really had enough and broke the 4th wall. Props to you.
This is DEKU all the way u cant tell me different
Caleb you are truly amazing in taking an essence of anime shows and converting in those  brilliant sketches. Someone would call them just a parodies of popular culture but I disagree. It is way harder that it looks. Bravo my man. Kudos to you! You are one of my favorite comic channels.
Just imagine Caleb and Dashie doing a skit together🤯🔥🐐
Midoriya flashbacks
Youve got school to do. so finish three more of these. then do your work.
He screams better than 99% of english VA

I wish I had this Caleb, in my head sometimes.
If attack on titan was a rom com.🤣

"Cause I am you are we are........."     EXCEPTIONAL!!!
Imagine having a motivational speaker as a conscious.
Caleb City Among Me
MHA in a nutshell. That anime is so annoying
lul this is why I don't watch anime, cause of shit like this that bugs me
I had a roommate who would routinely shower while singing at the top of his lungs at 3 am. I was so mad that whole time.
Dude, i dunno If it's just me but you look like you need some sleep, go on, we can wait, rest a little
Nice feet
@ Naruto & Deku
😂😂😂😂
*Evertime something happens in Naruto*
The way he slowly held up his keys and looked at them for a moment was wayyy too accurate lmfaooo
His neighbors probably moved bcuz he yells all the time even at night.
Io, Giorno Giovanna, ho un sogno
so basically deku
this is so danm true                                       why the hell are you still reading this?
I wonder what the teachers when they see this man giving himself motivational speeches during exams.
🤣
😘
😂😂😂 🌟 🌠 ✨ 💫
I don’t remember this episode of My Hero Academia... is this an OVA?
Plsss do superhuman interview 3 plssssssssss😁

feel like ive heard these before
I wasn't expecting him to look at the camera like that at the end and I was half way through devouring my bomb ass sandwich
Anime characters...?  I thought this was expected, normal friend behavior ... ☹   Fuck
The first part reminds me of Usopp leaving the usopp pirates to go with Luffy
The camera angles of the giving the motivational speeches 😂😂

Deku headass 😂😂
Only thing that would've made this better is of he turned him over on the couch and it turns out he's not even talking or awake. His thoughts are just that goddamn loud haha
His neighbors: 👁👄👁
1:38 all the simps in my girls dm when she says “ feeling ugly today”
i am dead at laughing hahaha
Video Idea: One person explaining sexual ideas/slang to another person who doesn’t know anything ab sex. Put jokes like “you gotta choke her, break her back, etc.” and have the other person shocked/astounded. I feel you could make this idea funny af in video😂
1:18 OK calm down Deku.
Bakugou:  Beats up Deku and spends years calling him worthless   Deku (for some reason):
*Krillin...*
It would be very uncomfortable to be in that situation
"YOU'RE EXCEPTIONALLLLLLLLLL!!!"
This is so Izuka Modoryia
The way Caleb 2 looked into the camera when Caleb 1 was crying felt like he knew I was laughing and wanted me to stop
I thought the white shirt guy would be giving the speech to never give up looking for the keya
Gave me chills
Deku vibes
"Thank you" "oka- "THANK YOU!"
reppin' that 100T merch 💪🏻💪🏻
Remember kids,   “YOU’RE EXCEPTIONAL!!!”
Hunter x hunter in a nutshell
Take it back!!!! 😂😂🤣
Deku be like:

Only way to avoid this ever again is to just remain positive around this guy... forever... and forever and forever.....               And evermore
Oh look. It's deku.
Ima laugh if that girl was the main charactor
For realz
I laughed so much my cheeks are paining xD
This is how anime villains are created
When you watch MHA
This made me think of Haikyuu ngl, Hinata be giving those motivational speeches to Kageyama once in a while lol
Lol my girlfriend does this exact thing
Yeah fam lets go 100 thieves
This is exactly why I stopped watching super hero academy whatever its called. Green haired kid cried every 5 minutes.
I need the flip side to this: anime characters that turn EVERYTHING into a reason to bully someone.
İ think its time to update that end card brody
Best Dub I ever saw
The way he be putting the cap down looks like the anime stuff really dope
Bro it's just keys
Sakura on the beat😭😭

How come I feel like there should be you say run in the background
Your friends that are to down gor you ahhhhhh that was funny
The sequal to this is Whenever Anime Characters On Mind Control
I'm here since vine <3
This one got me good. Funny AF
It is refreshing to see this dude making it to the top of the explore section with just a camera and  his average lifestyle in a time where YouTube is hijacked by wealthy lame motherfuckers. I mean look at the explore section right this moment, all the videos are like a tour of my multimillion-dollar house, I bought a $100,000 thing, first person to do this gets $100,000, I surprise my girlfriend with $100,000 thing, we built a $100,000 thing, we destroyed a $100,000 thing... And the rest of the videos are famous singers and Famous TV people. Who the hell watches that shit?!
Fun fact: cotton candy was invented by a dentist
When life gives you a hundred reasons to cry, show life that you have a thousand reason to smile:-))))
This is naruto and sasuke's relationship.

This guy will never run out of ideas 🤣🤣
1:11 - 1:50 Rock Lee
Deadass was 318-319 am when i saw this
My friend does this sometimes, but without exaggeration
caleb never misses
Hilarious 😂
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭I CANTTTTTTTTT
0:44 introverts when someone thanks them
Make a gaming channel and do collabs with rdc please. Loved the among us gameplay
I felt that stare at the end
Whenever he stares into the camera, means he is really disappointed
bruh. "I've been looking for like 20 minutes-" Me with my new fresh hand sanitizer that freakin' got lost after 13 minutes of being in the house
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” *www.soul.fish*
Naruto uses TalkNoJutsu
LMAOO jit throwed
I thought the piano at the end was L's theme at first lol. It would have fit so well
Yo am i trippin or are those his feet at 2:20 😳😂
Fairy Tail is quaking
That direct eye contact caught me off guard
If I must be honest. Anime speeches are mostly cringe than motivational
1:10-1:50 simps when they females self pity their self
Yup. This is in everrrry anime. Btw anybody ever tell him he sounds like a young Obama?
Nah this is rock lee😂😂😂
Caleb has consistently taught me to not let my homies crash on my couch over the years
0:27 yo the way he does that second look “damn this shit again”
:15 taught me that Caleb shops at Costco lol
😂😂😂
Bakugo: The bage hat Caleb.  Midoriya: the black hat Caleb.

1st thought was attack on Titan lol I hated that crybaby ass shit!
I really can't stop laughing at the second one
periodt ur acting skills ugh
I love the accurate delivery of the speech. They always have to scream it at the top of their lungs for some reason.
"Why are you screaming?"  Black Clover Fans always ask this
This is me when I say something bad to someone that is nice but I can't tell them I am sorry because I will get too nervous and then it will become akward and start to mutter I will feel really bad
My friend: I'm so trash.  Me: Your not trash, your a f***ing landfill.
Me:*laughing at this vid at 3 am  My brother: "shut UP!!!"
This would be a really good mindset if only the annoyingness was toned down.  Always check on your friends and spread positivity.
This be deku every 5 minutes man.
The first clip is kinda sad tho
If this was my roommate or my friend I would slap the living sh*t out of them
So accurate
I, Caleb City, have a dream that one day I could be as heroic as the one who found my keys.

You know, sometimes you just need Caleb to remind you that you aren’t trash. You are exceptional, even if you don’t wanna hear it. Thanks Caleb :)  Please stop yelling

Naruto is typing....
Caleb: thank you for supporting my videos for this long- Having subscribed last week: Well all I can say is that it's been a pleasure supporting you from the beginning. Being a part of this community has almost been a personal pride of mine, and it's been a joy to see your artistic craft grow and evolve over the years. V.V  jk jk x,D congrats tho

2:22 he looks into the camera like he is so done with this

I see that 100T hat 👀
This is how rock lee reacts every time might guy says something
Lol 😂😂😂
until you realize he's just talking to himself
Yo, u need to become a voice actor. wtf u r actually good.
Naruto been real quiet lately
_Me when I want an allowance_
It's just keeeeeeys... Why are you screaming? 😔
so no one gonna talk on how he slept with a hat on?
one of them is my hero academia
Yeah Gon started rubbing off on dude
Dude where did you get those fox plushes. They are so fucking cute.

Aw man I was hoping he would beat his ass up and he'd be like "I'm taking this for you, familyyyyyy!" or some shit
Kido from adventurous life of saki k
Kingdom Hearts 4 looks great

Lol...you always get the anime character reactions on point...
2:09 college life.
No cap, I had a roommate JUST LIKE THIS 🤣🤣
When you’re friend is trying to hype you up but you just wanna rage at the game lmao
1:09 me watching mob psycho and mob starts to doughbt himself once.
Bushy brow from naruto be like:
that one character who wants to be stronger and is always getting into trouble and being weak but will never be as strong as the main character
Deku *Cough *Cough
You're not trash...you're EXCEPTIONAL!!!
I love that he captured all of the anime camera things
Eran and Armin in the first season
He's done this so well 😂 it proper cringes me out when characters do this 🤣
He got that 100 Thieves hat
this is how I gotta be w the folks I date.
no one gonna mention the 100 thieves merch he rockin?
That is how it feels when your watching anime speeches🤔
Naruto: This mf spitting😂
Caleb has literally never made an unfunny video till this day
Dude i actually hate you, i just watched, "When your dramatic friend slips down two steps" and literally my entire body is cramping up from laughing.
Deku every 10 seconds:
Yoooo he got the anime scene down and everything, all he had to do was speak Japanese.
Chrome like shit
I didn’t know you post full episodes of Naruto like this
Fuuuuuuuuug, I'm this anime character 😅😭🤦‍♀️
This really explains Midoriya in the entire  first Season.
Which you like better calebcity or lenarr young  Like :for calebcity Comment: for lenarr young
Is he acting like asta
I thought his feet were crusty and ashy at 2:10. But then I paused the video and zoomed in and saw that he's wearing socks 😂 😂😂😂
The Ash Ketchum glistening tears behind the hat is sending meeee
This!!! This is exactly why its so hard for me to watch anime now. I cant listen to another 14-15 year old and their motivational speech. If I try to search for josei or adult anime, I get some borderline hentai bs.
I thought he was gonna hit us with that one piece music...
Not monologuing at 3am 😂
Calebs the funniest guy in the world
He has an Atari controller🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🖕
Now I want him to make a "If anime villians didn't fall for the motivational speech" video
The most accurate guy ever
1:32 me trying to cheer my friend up while thdyre having an episode
Caleb at the end was like 👁👄👁
One of the many reasons I don’t watch many anime’s.
This is pretty much naruto and sasuke in a wrap minus the filler.
This is basically Naruto anytime he fights *anyone* in the series. Like we get it bro, you wanna be hokage. Stfu and stop telling everybody you meet about it
Caleb: *deadass almost starts crying* Me: shocked.gif
Nice 100 thieves plug!
Ya'll cant lie, Caleb kinda cute
That's how Naruto be

This is the shit I HATE about anime
Naruto talk no justu
Jesus Christ saves from sin. Romans 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Hebrews 9:27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Isaiah 64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Revelation 21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. Romans 5:8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3:16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Romans 10:9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. John 5:24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. Ephesians 2:8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8:1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 2 Corinthians 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. .....................

His neighbors probably think he is a bit messed up in the head from all that screaming and fighting with himself as well as looking dead serious into space as he mumbles things XD
Haha this is great. I feel the same way when a character starts going into these almost worshiping compliments. So awkward this will never not be funny to me.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
The head covering the eyes are on point👌🏽😂
Naruto to everyone
I’ve watched every single video 4-5 times and I hunger for more

Is this Sakura?
Oh, a decent video on trending that isn't a rap song, an over dramatic music video or a breakup/getting back together video. Let's not forget those "we're pregnant" videos.   I suppose I can't blame people for liking that tra...stuff though. To each their own.
Give this man a show like Chappelle
Facts in it's true form
1 like let's this man sleep for another night and not wake up to yelling

Oh you noticed? This right here is a genuine, pristine youtube algorithm comment. There's none like it.

*Every Fucking Attack On Titan Episode EVER*
2:22 Caleb’s “I’m having an epiphany” theme song
When sasuke tries to leave the village again
The hat over the eyes 😂😂
The fucking 100 Thieves merch made my fucking day, I didn't expect the hat.

Oh cool, ive been waiting for the new season of Fairy Tail!!
amazing
Basically my grandma in church
100 Thieves? You joining?
Something else for you. If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.    God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16    God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, he loves you, open your heart take a chance receive Jesus as your savior.
Guess whos back back again ❤️
I hate the people that are like this in real life too 😂
Lmfao the way he escalated
*One Piece All The Time*
Thats nice but upvote this if  *onlyfanslol c0m* has the best discord for only fans
Naruto
You sound like zenitzu🤣🤣
0:34 *i love how he hides his eyes just like in animes when they about to get serious*
The manga was better
Istg😂
Honestly that Anime character needs to be apart of our subconscious, maybe less lengthy go hard, but to hard for positive mind set and stomp out the negative. 3am portion is what happens when your mind is stuck on a re-run thought haha
BRO WHY DO THEY DO THIS its like when you get a new phone but you drop the phone ur friend:YOUR NOT TRASH
LMAO that was me yesterday before my drivers test
At 0:26 he's going through PTSD
LMFAO
Why is this real ?😂😂😂
Garra be like:
Man, his neighbors must feel confused and grateful at the same time
Jesus died for our sins on the cross , was buried , and rose again on the third day and because of this you are saved.
Now you gotta fight
Rock Lee and Asta be like:

Shut up shut up is all I hear!
Can we just appreciate the fact that he was recording at 3:20 in the morning
also known as the "insecure-friend-who-took-crack-for-the-first-time-syndrome"
Caleb can probably write the script for a Shonen anime with these speeches
The best ting since slice bread 🍞 lol 😂 (I’m horrible at putting comments ). But in other words this was 🔥🔥✨❣️
that hat angle shot is perfect
Your are my friend ahhh Japanese “

Love when he breaks the 4th wall by looking at camera 😂
The Pharoah's internal monologue as Tea and his cheerleaders tout the power of their friendship for the hundredth time: "I'm the literal King of Games, with the power to bend the odds in my favor. Let me do my thing."
Narutoverse b like😂...
Plot twist: the first 2 scenes were genjutsu created to motivate his friend while he slept, unfortunately that left him vulnerable because he has to be asleep for it to work
this feels like a fever dream
Wet
It’s the wits lips for me
You’re not traaaaash!!
literally deku every time he beats up a god and breaks his legs, so somebody has to carry him
Lmaoo the gasp 😭😭
Me @ my friends

*YOUR EXCEPTIONAL*  Bob put that in a t-shirt
IM ON THE GAME 1:37
I wish I was this good at talking to myself
is this about mha
Hey everyone, Am Tulane Allae, I  Have being in a relationship with My Boyfriend for 3 years, he broke up with me, I  did everything possible to bring him back but all was in vain, I wanted him back so much because of the love I have for him, I begged him with everything, I made promises but he refused. I explained my problem to someone online and she suggested that I should rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back but I am the type that never believed in love spell cast, I had no choice than to try it, I mailed the spell caster, and he told me there was no problem that everything will be okay before three days, that my ex will return to me before three days, he cast the spell and surprisingly in the second day, it was around 4pm. My ex called me, I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was so sorry for everything that happened, that he wanted me to return to him, that he loves me so much. I was so happy and went to him, that was how we started living together happily again. Since then, I have made promises that anybody I know that has a relationship problem or child problem would be of help to such a person by referring him or her to the only real and powerful spell caster who helped me with my own problem and who is different from all the fake ones out there. Anybody could need the help of the spell caster, contact his email or number if you need any help contact him too on this. You will see in conclusion you have to just trust the process, Dr Wiseone is a good real spell caster so call him or add him on Whats-app: +1(270)2623873 or email him on his email address: Drwiseoneherbtemple@gmail.com you can email him if you need his assistance in your relationship or anything. He is ready to help you. Or visit His website on https://drwiseoneherbhome.wordpress.com
Rock lee, Asta, Nastu, can anyone else name a few I don't know many of those characters.
The hat and screming 😂😂😂😂😂  Aaaa l'm on the gaame shut uuup
Magnificent

One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
I got some Armin vibe out of this
Tbh it’s kinda just sad, dude probably never had any friends and is just now getting a friend for the first time
Amazing, just amazing

https://youtu.be/P3VcBXe6pag
* Random Quote from the video *  comment section: Stonks↗️↗️↗️
When you take shots at naruto
crin
I know right? Like those scenes where like the love interest is like: IM SORRY!! I wish I was better... When I was a kid I was bad at everything! I had no frie- Me: Damn Bro Stfu! I know!! That's why you are my FRIEND!!!
Do not boast about tomorrow, For you do not know what a day may bring forth. Proverbs 27:1 “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 2 Corinthians 12:9 "Therefore, as it is written,  “He who glories, let him glory in the Lord.” 1 Corinthians 1:31
The crazy thing is I know people like that irl it kinda sucks but it’s hell motivational
One piece looking good
Naruto: 👀
I like how he changed from boruto to Screaming Asta
Me: _mildly insults self_ *Every mom within a ten mile radius:* 1:11
*Its super effective*

GUY SENSAIIIIIIII 😭😭😭
So this is what deku would look like in real life
I’m dead ☠️☠️☠️
This is exactly how deku acts Everytime someone saves him lmaooo
EXACTLY why do anime characters especially in naruto always have to make those speeches
Reminds me of Ash Ketchum
When CALEB looked at the screen 2:23 😭😭
1:33 my subconscious mind vs. my conscious mind
He represented it perfectly
Sound like deku
me @ my mom when she finds my shit
And then he become his rival
Deku if he was a real person
It’s the way his hat his covering his eyes
Deku n nyone of his friends
XD always found hillarious how anime chars always make the most mundane things so dramatic to the point that i am always wondering if the authors actually know peole or if they have no clue about how human interactions actually are lmao
😂
I told my mom she’s exceptional and she slapped me in the face
"Don't say that!" How his fists are balled up really sealed the deal, hahaha!
Yareyare
Video Summary: You’re EXCEPTIONAL!!!....Alright boom that’s all I got!

Why is this Elizabeth from Seven Deadly Sins???
This is hilarious
This is my new Favourite video
I literally read the title and "all might" blasted in my head lmfao
I wish they would make an anime from the POV of a side-side-character of them watching them make a speech and them asking "the fuck is he talking about".
MDRRRRRRRRR
Lolololololololololololololololol
1:39 When you're so exasperated u just start making screaming noises 😂
Is it even an anime if no one cries?
Seven Deadly Sins
https://youtu.be/W5PWBkrMahU it’s not season 4 of attack on titans
Boku no hero academia live action
He broke the 3rd dimension
my boy trending that’s wassup 💪🏾
Please accept jesus as lord and savior everyone! The rapture of the church is coming according to the prophecy of Israel becoming a nation. Israel became a nation in 1948, Jesus said he would come back after Israel becomes a nation again. A biblical generation is 80 years. Meaning he should come back and set his kingdom in Jerusalem in 2027 or 2028. But before that, After he collects his believers, there is seven years of tribulation, also called the great tribulation. These 7 years will be hell on earth and the mark of the beast, which is the Covid-19 vaccine or the new amazon palm chip(look it up it just came out) will take over. It will change your DNA and make you humanoid and you will be unforgivable by God because jesus died for humans not humanoids. If you decide not to take the mark, they will execute you but you will be heaven if you accepted jesus in that time period. You don't want to be here when that happens so accept jesus now. The great tribulation is coming in 2020 or 2021 if you subtract 7 years from 2027 or 2028. Right before that jesus comes to get believers so believe him today! Don't get left behind.
Sir 😭 those brown socks look like an animals foot
Caleb should be a motivational speaker.
🤣🤣🤣
Become a voice actor😂

1:28 Bakugo and Midoriya 24/7
On September 27 Azerbaijan launched missile attacks along the entire line of contact with Artsakh targeting also the peaceful settlements, including the capital Stepanakert. Nowadays Artsakh is under attack by the Turkish-Azerbaijani alliance and terrorists involved (BBC, The Guardian, Reuters, Forbes, Al Jazeera etc published details, proves and facts of this involvement and the direct connection with Turkey).   The Turkish military experts are fighting side by side with Azerbaijanis, who are using the Turkish weapons, including UAVs and warplanes. Meanwhile, Turkey provides full political and propaganda support to Azerbaijan at the highest level of its leadership. The military actions provoked by Azerbaijan with the support of Turkey are a gross violation of international law.  Saudi Arabia has officially banned Turkish products. It is time for the world to follow its example. 51.9% of products exported from Turkey were bought by importers in Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Iraq, United States, France, Spain, Netherlands, Israel, Russia, Romania, United Arab Emirates.  Show that you care and want to stop terrorism.  The world needs your support. Please, sign this petition.   https://www.change.org/p/worldwide-don-t-finance-terrorism-put-embargo-on-turkish-products
Literally every scene with Lee and Guy
Why is it only a select demographic of ppl that make all these anime videos. Not even the ppl who make anime make as many “anime reference” videos.
If this aint Naruto before, during, and after the chunin exams🤣😂
Naruto: believe it 👊😁
Not even gonna front i got a friend like this.
Asta and Deku: >_>

JESUS IS COMING Believe the Gospel and Repent ⬇️⬇️⬇️  “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9 | KJV  REPENT: feel or express sincere regret or remorse about one's sin   THIS WORLD IS FULL OF SIN JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY !!! JESUS COMING BELIEVE AND AND ACCEPT AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR TRUST IN HIM TODAY GOD LOVES YOU SO MUCH JUST COME BACK HOME AND LOVE HIM BACK  DENY YOURSELF DAILY AND TURN FROM SIN DAILY         #christian #jesus #faith #love #god #bible  #christ #church #christianity #fairtrade #gospel #hope #blessed #jesuschrist #truth #handmade #prayer #pray #scripture #life #holyspirit #worship #peace #godisgood #inspiration #religion #bibleverse #encouragement #motivation #goodnews

i was watching anime yesterday and i can say that this video is very accurate lol
1:03 Bro, where did you get that cute fox pillow plush thing? I want one
usually I think you make these go on for too long / take it too far. But this one is just completely spot-on. Love the "looking down with hat covering eyes" repeatedly
How living in the UA dorms with Midoriya must be like.
I can't believe I can laugh this loud
Sometimes I doubt if they're the same person
Is that a 100T hat i see 👀
YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAAAAAAALLL!!!!!!
*its just keeeys. Why you screamin*
2:02 when he checked his phone, it was same exact time for me, pretty creepy mayne
Scary, when he checked his phone for the time at 2:05 it was exactly the same time as I am watching this.
Always thought, that anime characters have some issues.
I can feel the anger in the movement
Man nah he ain’t do it right, after a friend talks down about themselves the main protag straight haymaker in the jaw leaving the ground. Talking about “Shut up! You were always better me! Take it back!” 😂😂
The stare into the camera after the 3rd time really got me 😂
Dudes when a girl calls herself ugly on instagram.
第一次玩油管
Me in the mirror... everyday: 1:32

I love how the moment he said thank you twice we knew what we where getting into
Me:  Sees CalebCity is #10 on trending.  Also Me: *YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAL!*
This guy does everything just for a video
Now that I think about it, I would hate it if anime was real.
Bruh this is too accurate😂😂😂😂The way his cap covered his eyes😂😂😂
I don’t get it...why is this My Hero Academia scene on trending???....
Wonder what his neighbors think when they hear *YOU’RE NOT TRAAAAAASH* 🤔
Thats how anime works
This is the backstory of that friend who would kill those neighbors taking the house parking spot
Sakura after every mission

This is too accurate man everyone be gassing up their friend only for them to get dropped by an important character

Looks like someone has been watching my hero.
I laughed sooo hard when he was on the couch with it 🤣
hahaha
Motivational speeches in anime makes me wanna drop everything and do what they’re doing. But motivational speeches in real life be awkward
Warning; Here is how it will play out  1. If Jesus Christ comes back to take his church and found you not saved (not believing at him as the savior through believing he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and that he risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now) you will be left behind and there will be great tribulation you will suffer on earth and that will be God's judgement.  The only way to be saved at tribulation after left behind by Jesus when majority of Christians have disappeared is to not take the mark of the beast on your forehead or right hand and you will be killed or starve to death.  2. Death always occur you can die at any time and the huge issue is if you die before Christ returns and you were not believing at him as the savior( that is not believing at Christ that he was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and risen again on the third) your soul will go straight to Hell for eternity, at Hell you will burn but not consumed.  Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.   Believing at Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting Christ will send you the wrong direction.  Hebrews 10:4, 10 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   Any other form of sacrifice be it animal sacrifices it can't save you but we are only saved through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that.   Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Believe and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now.   After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.  Romans 6:6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.  Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag.
Elizabeth 7 deadly sins 😂
It was very funny and enjoyable❤❤❤❤👏👏👏👏👏👏👏  Please subscribe me and watch my videos as well❤
Broo this is every one piece arc all over again

That’s for sure how you let a death flag in
thats low key me tho
Me with my girlfriend
This screams Haikyu lmao
Basically every friendship powerd Anime
Yo Calebcity... um I have like an “idea” for a sketch.   You know when your Apple Watch tells you that you should breathe for a minute. Be like ya know “bruh, I’ve been breathing today *breathes deeply*” then like some Apple person comes in through the door and starts choking you or some shit sayin “you sure bout’ that”  It would probably be a short sketch but like ya know, WHO CARES... anyway this probs won’t get noticed but whatev, LOVE YA CONTENT
Caleb I had this question for a long long long time          Ya like jazz?
Why is this Armin in EVERY EPISODE of AOT 😂
Its like Deku vs Bakugo except no hands were thrown
So basically Natsu from Fairy Tail
If you read all 8.5+ comments I'll give you 2,000$ PayPal Only.
Day 2 of watching this vid
Naruto
This is something Kenta Yumia would say. Points to anyone who can tell me which anime that’s from.
What it really feels like to be a side character
Idk why but this is so accurate with a lot of animes
*cough*Deku*cough*
you killed it on this one . hahahahah
Footage of Rock Lee
You should be the live action Deku
You and lenarr should do another colab vid
So true caleb
Who tryna make this into an alarm tone lmao
This reminds me more of when your best friend is just a lil cry baby bitch and you have to tolerate it cause you're their best friend and that's what best friends do, unfortunately.
*Janken has entered the chat*
Its true that we give speeches on the simplest of things...  *Thank you for point out how flawed we are without being harsh about it. Ill make you proud, Caleb!! Ill stop giving motivational speeches everywhere but its just that you inspire everyone SO MUCH! you have made me a part of the fam and i can never forget what you did for me! Ill go out into the world, with this inspiration and with the energy you gave me, I'LL SURPASS ANY OBSTACLE AND BECOME THE BEST IN THE WORLD. I BELIEVE IT!*
No one: Caleb breaking the 4th wall: O_O Me: and I oop
Deku in every fight be like
"Thank you..." "Yup. No problem, I got you bro—" "THANK YOU...!" "😐"
Now I understand why some people don't want any motivational speech when they're depressed
Pokemon
Thats deku
This is every Rock Lee and Might Guy interaction ever.
Izuku midorya is crying rn
Umm why is he wearing  a 100 thieves 🧢 is that just some apparel or he hinting
"Why do i play this game? Im trash!" Fuck that hits deep. Every time i die in anything i play lmao.

I’m dead bruh
Love your motivational 📼's, there amazing!👍👏♥️💯
Bruh I am watching Fairy Tail and that happens all the time 😂😂😂
ur not funny anymore ):
when he was screaming in his sleep that was some Asta shit lmao
This literally is Armin
You know, sometimes I completely forget Caleb is acting both roles
This is a one content keep up the good work
Me: “You want to watch tv with me.” Anime characters : “As a kid, I watched a lot of tv. The many characters inspired me to be the person I am today. Today, go watch some tv and see how a character can inspire your life.”  Me: “I’m hungry. Let’s eat.” Anime character: “We should eat not just for sustenance but for yearning. We must yearn to learn, inspire, and improve.”
Imagine being his neighbour and hearing muffled  anime monologues every day      https://youtu.be/_boXEW3y6Qw
What I hear when someone says good job... and how I react to said complement...

What Pain says: lol no pain no game die nub     What you hear: Do you understand pain a little now? If you don't share someone's pain, you can never understand them. But just because you understand them doesn't mean you can come to an agreement. That's the truth"
#10 trending in us
His trending
I dont know why but I think it would be funny if there was a like a cross over video of every anime trope you have done and then they fight the villain that usually has some dumb thing.

Man is this like aggressive positivity. or like nuclear compliments?
2:06 the whole naruto and sasuke conflict in a nutshell
Naruto: How can I be Hokage when I can't save one friend? Me: The same way Neji died during the War and you went on to become Hokage anyway. Naruto: 😲
We not gonna talk about him repping that 100T
If he this motivated then the other dude gona die very soooon.....XD
It hurts more being called “exceptional” than “bad” or “trash”.
Be honest. We all need a friend that supports you like that.
Mans is saving the internet
Whats the piano music at 2:22 called?
Why do you have to be so motivational?  Its just a game.

Why is the MC hiding his eyes? Is this the type of anime I think this is?
1:40 The fact that his reaction was just bare screaming SENDS ME
Should’ve dropped sadness and sorrow, that’s how you know shit bout to get emo
Oh God, the ACCURACY

Deku
Yo! classic looking at the camera was a sick touch bruh! keep making hit vids please

Anime is like....a good, fun, worth watching soap opera....  Can you relate 👇
You forgot the "I'll NEVER FORGIVE YOU" part of the speech.

One piece characters in a nutshell
Why is this so accurate?
Is this an episode of My Hero Academia? 🤣🤣
I’d like to think that in Caleb city every house is a different dimension
I’d definitely buy it but I only have a limited amount of money and a non stable income, and I need some new clothes man :(
this is so accurate what the heck 😂
anime characters do me doing that 😂
Camera man: Ayo zoom in zoom in I want that angle   Calebs teeth: rrfrfrlfvtutXdityjk
This is one of my biggest pet peeves with anime
Nobody meme and timestamp comments: Everywhere Original Comments: Gone, reduced to atoms.
Didn’t know the new season of my hero academia was already out lol
Been here since 300k, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. Good job, bro 👍🏽. Respect the hell out of your hustle to get to this point!  Got fucking action figures out here now 😂.
I'm just here to see his tensed face
Naruto: *sweating*
This has krillin written all over
deku:
Wanba do a collab with longbeachygriffy??? Would looove to see that!
These speeches remind me what a disappointment I am
The hat over his eyes...  so accurate.
That 100 thieves hat is hot though
I choked while I was eating bro 😂😂😂😂
I feel personally attacked by the last one
Super hero interview part 3
Thank you so much Caleb! 😂
It's funny but I'm not gonna lie,it would be nice to have positive when you're bad at something instead getting clown on lol
Literally my teammates

this is inaccurate. everyone is supposed to have giant eyes.
Your bed look comfortable af
This is like full on Midoriya energy.

Great video man never fails to make me laugh 😆
When the main character starts to give you a speech about how much of a great friend you are that only means one thing you probably gonna die so the main character can use that as motivation to whoop the villian ass.
I literally laugh every. Single. time. he starts screaming in his videos.
Dude Wasn’t Ready For Tht “Second Thank You”😂😂😂
Kachan and Deku be like
I swear bruh LMAOAOAOAO

Deku be like:
Me: hits a wrong note on the piano and says I’m trash   My mom: 1:33
0:26 you can already tell from his face that he's dealt with this kind of shit before and is not having it.
This is like the opposite of depression lmao imagine if that little voice in your head was like that and not a negative nancy
Your vids are the types that should always be on the trending page. Tired of seeing celebrities on there.
Haven't even watched the video yet but just looking at the title i know it'll be good
Lmao but those are the ppl you gotta look for
This reminds me that anime villains train for years and years and when the protagonist knows the true power of freind ship they become overpowered
Midoriya🤦🏽‍♂️
1:33 : me in the mirror after  every time I cause some minor inconvenience
Bro why do have love this guy so much

Holy crap 1/5 of the views are likes🤣🤣🤣
Maybe the real keys were the friends who annoyed us along the way
elizabeth to meliodas 😭
This video made me think about ken ‘s- the digimon emperor brother getting hit by car... why I don’t know lol
Yelling *“YOU’RE EXCEPTIONAL”* is actually the hardest thing I can imagine.

lmfaooooooo
The sub was better
naruto is overrated idc
Paul George after the playoffs loss
Is it bad that I just pictured ALL of these scenes as Deku🤣
This is Deku all day!!!! All he needs is the tears
The speeches sound like something Gennos (from one punch man) would say 😂😂
Its the looking down for me
That took an unexpected turn.
Luffy whenever female #8364844 gets hit by wrongful ruler #353576357
Deku is that you
Nobody :     Iketani ( from initial D ) :
When the female character talks to the male character after they do something a little nice for them:  "You're always there for me, you take up all my burdens. Even when I'm at my lowest you're always there, I'm so pathetic even when you're doing all this for me. You're so strong protagonist-kun yada yada yada..."
I feel like I'm watching an episode of naruto (and fairytail)
ok so deku and naruto ansxnj
hahahahahahahahahahahha yo this mans content is always funny  man !
The he looked at the camera 😂😂😂
When you can't see his eyes, you know shit is real lmao😂😂
Me realizing he is referencing Haikyu 🤣😂☠️👌
The female character when the male character helps them a little.  "You were always there for me and you take up all my burdens, yada yada...."
This is every character in Haikyu in a fucking nutshell tbh
This is how I sound whenever my friends buy me food lol
i like the 100 thieves hat though. didn't know you're a league fan
So Caleb made this just to flex his 100T merch, I see you Caleb
You’re on trending? Not bad!
Where was captain America
YOUR EXCEPTIONALLLLLLL
Oh god he even did the "eyes covered up during the serious talk" thing
My guy sound like rock lee
Straight outa naruto
Attack on titan Eren ....well no every damn anime 🙄
This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that even breaking just one of these commandment makes us guilty of breaking them all.   The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace; except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..  So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved .   The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27); ‘it is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ .
Remember to those who wanna live in the anime world. Gotta deal with this bullcrap.
Classic Caleb Anime
Naruto use to pull of this shit  even during a battle nd it would drive me crazy....talk no jutsu
the face he made after he said thank you twice had me rolling
So basically deku every time he talks lol
It’s Peralta and Boyle.
this was beyblades
Lol
deku in a nutshell
THIS VIDEO FELT LIKE THE OGS
😂😂😂😂
It's okay, you can say Kaito Momota in any class trial 🧍‍♂️
I hate almost all motivational speeches in anime for this reason; their speeches are inadvertently annoying and they usually oversell their message with stuff like screaming at the top of their lungs, punching the ground full force while crying, etc. And all it does is make me shake my head and cringe.
85% of naruto and it's fillers 😂
Is this a Naruto Uzamaki diss?
The deadpan look at the camera. It gets me everytime. 😂😂
I feel like he watched a lot of Bleach for this video's inspiration.
https://youtu.be/Uxeaq8kO6VU
I’m getting flashbacks to that scene where Hinata is screaming and crying at Kageyama that he’ll stay in the court longer than him someday and idk why.
So like all of Fruits Basket?
🤣
1:40 made this video for me
Wow this is the 1st time I've seen somebody else in your vids besides you. Proud of you. I know getting Deku to cameo wasn't easy. 10/10
This Parody of Asta from Black Clover is SPOT ON
Lee from Naruto

If u play outro on 2x speed its tuff
I wonder what his neighbour thinks about him lmao
If you are reading this comment and do not have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, please know that it is no mistake you saw this message. Hard times are coming. The mark of the beast as warned about in the book The Holy Bible is soon here. ID2020 with mandatory vaccines, quantum dot tattoo to verify vaccine compliance and cashless society/ cryptocurrency have been planned out for humanity, ushered in by the new world order elite ( *not with good intentions*) Soon the great tribulation will be here as warned about also in The Holy Bible. A time that the world has never seen since even the beginning (* not good*)  (Matthew chp 24:21 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be) A powerful world leader will also arise only to deceive the world. ( Revelation chp 13:16-And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.“Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.”) The world's only hope is a Savior sent from God our heavenly father, His Son Jesus Christ who died for our wrong doings (John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”)   It's not too late for you if you are reading this but soon it will be. Please call on the name Jesus Christ now while there is still time. All you have to do is pray and ask Him for forgiveness of your sins and ask Him into your heart by believing with sincerity and He can begin a personal relationship with you. Please see the book the Holy Bible for more information  or leave a comment. Please remember it doesn't matter who you are or what you have done, He loves you more than you could ever know. Please remember this when times get tough.

Naniiiiiiii!! This is super motivational
Why do I get major Deku vibes
Deku in a nutshell
Naruto type beat^^^
You can say naruto it's okay
This is why Sasuke left the leaf village
Skit suggestion: " If everyone talked like they do in ads and commercials"
It could become perfect, if he started crying while his eyes were hidden under cap...
This eren and medoriya ..I swear😂😂
If deku was a real person.
Gon?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Honestly, I can see why Bakugo hates Midoriya so much.
Meeeeeeeee haha
For one second, he sounds like 'Craig Middlebrooks' from Parks and Rec.
1:05 I have the same fox + this reminds me of one of my friends :):
Two words. Gon Freecs.
This is so great.
THAT SHIT HAD ME DEAD WHEN HE LOOKED AT THE CAMERA
Caleb's neighbors: He's screaming motivational speeches now?? And here I thought he ran out of things to scream..
Rock lee all the way 💀
Me on MDMA
Ok but not only does he immediately put his hat on when getting outta bed but other bro sleep with a hat on 😂
Sad part is this so real
Why does Caleb look EXACTLY like Malcolm X?  Can someone confirm if they're related?
If this isn’t Deku
1:40 the way he shouted back just to try and even it up 💀
Naruto..
To the person that reading this:  You’re very intelligent and an awesome human! Stay healthy during quarantine:)  My dream is to have 10k. i’ve been struggling, please help:)

Moe is a snake
"Why do I play this game I'M TRASH"  big mood.
i miss caleb breaking the 4th wall
Naruto and Deku
a wave of cringe hit me so hard lmao
The "gasp" when he opened the drawer is soooooo anime.
Let’s be real we all know this deku
LoL why are you screaming 😂
ILL DO BETTER GUY SENSEI
I swear there was a video just like this...
😂🤣😵💀
Anyone know the background music playing at 1:27? Asking for a friend
Would've just shot his ass, idk what y'all doing.  Y'all act like this guy ain't going to die somehow by some poision effect, and have that long ass death with their own personal sad ost, and come back at the important part as a spirit and help the main character.
I’ve never laughed this hard from a CalebCity video, and that’s saying something 😂
This basically just MJ on last dance
those feet. freaking dry.   pause 1:53
0:50 is Caleb joining 100T
Deku in a nutshell
Bro what was so funny was when he looked at the camera, like bro I’m done
Hajime no Ippo, when Ippo is getting the shit beaten out of him:  Ippo: That guy is amazing and so strong!
i swear this is armin from attack on titans, elizabeth from sds and deku bro
Had such "friend" in high school. The edgy cringe was intense. And since he found out that I was also watching some anime, he promised to always be there for me and protect me (i didnt need to be protected lol)  He always used to sit on top of some shit like container or tree or stuff like that, wearing a hoodie (assassin wanna be) and look down like he sleeps but he isnt. Through his long ass front hair covering 80% of his face he was starring at me and people around me. Always looking angry. He simped so hard I thought he'd kill my parents if they'll ground me. Damn.
Did 100 thieves recruit you?
I see Caleb is on the 100T squad now.... awesome.
So spongebob and squidward?
So no one's gonna talk about how he sleeps with his hat on lmao
I've watched all Caleb's videos... So now I'm like a fiend when a new one comes out
I like how he is actually annoying. Are we sure that he isn’t an anime character?
Idkw but the 100thieves hat is really distracting
that 4th wall breaking looking face 😂
ahahahahaha
Gosh I thought I saw anime characters that turn everything into a JoJo reference for some reason
16 hours after vid release I get notification THANK U utube
I feel like one day... you will be hokage!
lmfao
This has some real "beat up my friend for shit talking himself" vibe
Thats one piece to the max
Character in every anime: *Eyes have left the chat:*
This is why I hate one piece Naruto / BORUTO or fairytale
Anime guy- YOU'RE MY FRIEND!!!! (voice echoes) Friend- Where the hell did that echo come from? (looking around the room)
the hat covering the eyes is literally the most accurate thing I've see all week
I see you with the 100 Thieves hat on, I see you
Talk No Jutsu but it's not an enemy it's a friend
Im literally dying 😭
Dude, you are MORE than a FIGURINE! Don't BELITTLE YOURSELF by making yourself a FIGURINE! TAKE IT BACK! TAKE IT BAAAACK!
Bruh, I’m glad I’m not the only one annoyed by those cringe motivational speeches.
This sounds like every Naruto episode
wheres the part about him wanting to be hokage
Bruh. I be skipping the motivational speeches.
Sounding like joe biden lol SHUT UP MAN
Lmao. Izuku Midoriya anyone? 😅😅😅
Bro this is every anime
0:40
I wished the videos were longer I could watch these all day everyday
Peoples dreams never end!
All my family watch him and we didn't know that it was like a common secret ...
which episode of haikyuu is this😭😭
This is low key making me hate anime again
Oh shoot, a Deku sketch
AOT be like:
He got the look down at the floor when speaking nailed
Maan, I cringe most of the time when such scenes come in anime.
I love parasyte because migi just piss on these types monologues and straight tell the mc that he doesn't care but for its own life
my hero in a nutshell
The coach from Haikyu🏐😂
caleb with black hat: Dude, where are my keys  caleb with white hat: I think they're in the drawer  Me: Wait, are they the same person?
100 Thieves
This is what genos off of one punch man
Sugawara: I'll send you some receives   Hinata: THANK YOU! YOUR EXCEPTIONAL!!!!!!
This is like genous
“It’s just keys! Why are you screaming!”
This is literally one piece all the time
😂😂😂
"Why do I play this game I'm trash"  Hit me right in the feels
the chin beard looks like pubes.
Everything straight from MHA 😄
I am kind of liking too much of those speeches not going to lie
1:50 hopefully those are socks!!! Otherwise this man got slave feet
https://youtu.be/4uPao0h4TJ0
Yoooo 100thieves !!!
This is just Deku
its so weird seeing you look at me
0:27 He knew
The way he said I’ll make my family proud killed me
how about you make one of when an anime character does that shit when they pass by you and its just white in the background, so you just get blinded by it
Did you mean: Izuku Midoriya
Naruto be like
Alternative title: Deku
I immediately thought of Gon from HXH for some reason
Naruto 101
This is what Armin is like to Eren and Mikasa
.... i suppose the collabs with Griffy rubbed off on him a bit too much....
"TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAAAIID, TAKE IT BAACCK!"
Cue All Might - get off of me kid
when the hat covers  the eyes you know stuffs about to get serious
yeah man, you already i've been here since the 3 subscriber special

Deku in 2 minutes and 30 seconds:
Flexing that 100 thieves  hat  😉
RDC x Caleb?
"Its c..cool"  "Its keys"
Eat your cereal
the real keys were the friends we made along the way
The "take back you said" bring me flashbacks to the weak character protecting his friend to later be the saikyou no hero i mean Deku type
We need a part 2
If my friends were like this, we're scrapping.
My Hero Academia in a nutshell
You’re awesome my guy

Flexing the 100T hat
Rean Swazcher of Class XII this is about you.
“THANK YOOOOOOOU!!!”  “YOU’RE EXCEPTIONAAAAAAAAL!!!! TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAAAAAAAAAID!!!!”  “I’LL MAKE MY FAMILY PROOOOOOOOUD!!”  The fact that my ears were telling me to stop listening but my eyes and my heart said continue means that Caleb did a good job.
The hat covering the eyes really got me
This is the difference between rw and the anime world
been with yea since 15_k
Nearly broke my front tooth while watching this video and laughing so hard  that I leaned forward a little too much and hit my front tooth on my desk but everything is intact thank God. so I definitely had to say something about how funny this shit was. This was awesome keep up the funny man it's really great stuff. ✌🏾
Freaking genius 😂
Fruits Basket lmao
We just accepted it as regular shit too.
Why is this like naruto 😂
Love the video and that 100 thieves cap
Caleb then gets tired of his friend and so he cocks his gun and shoots him
The 4th wall break at the end. Masterpiece.
I just realized i scroll down in full screen O-o
this is me LOL
this is just deku at the end of every episode
That one cute blue-haired girl in food wars. :/                              No... Food wars itself                                   Jk food wars is bomb
yo that shit was funny af
This giving some strong Naruto vibes. Goku just like fuck all the BS let's get straight to it
He did a young mydoria
Steven universe...
i was fully expecting the dude to hit the dramatic anime character with a bat. XD
TAKE IT BAAAAAAAAACCCCCCKKKKKKK
It's my birthday today. Anmie really be like that 😆
It...it's cool, It's keys...  This got me 😂
Naruto broken down to it’s basic fundamentals
What kinda couch is that?
I feel like he's just venting his frustration and making it a youtube video.
I mean, I'd be annoyed, but I'd also appreciate it 😂
So basically deku
YOURE EXCEPTIONAAALLL  AHHHH  I MEAN IT
Cool it deku
I Bless you with the blessings of a full beard
I feel personally attacked by this 😂😂😂
I kinda expected him to start motivational crying at the thank you for supporting him.
This is like Deku and All Might
Dude obviously needed a motivational speech and you didn't give it to him after all the times he hyped you up smh
Naruto talk no jutsu:
LMAOOO "TAKE THAT BAAAACKK" 😂😂
Listen im not defending bakugou’s past behavior but I too would get fucking annoyed at someone screaming praise at me 24/7
thank you  yep got you alright br-  THANK YOU
The power of friendship is too strong
This is what every anime dose
I do this to annoy my friends
mc: Yo could you lend me that soda? sc: Here ya go. mc: I'm sorry, i'm a failure, I promise i'll be better. you have really opened eyes friend.
Maybe the keys were the friends we made along the way.
Never really looked at Caleb's comment section but this videos comments are pretty lame. Why are people even doing skits of mha in here lol 😷
This made me want to subscribe twice, lmao
Lmfaoooo that crying at the end!
That 100 Thieves hat looking fire👀
0:26 His "wait what" face 🤣 1:12 How long has he been there? 🤔 2:22 His "I....I can't" face 😂
For the fact that he put a hat on a 3 AM just to differentiate between characters shows dedication.
bro this is actually how it goes down sometimes 🤣
Basically Deku and almost every my hero character
Plot twist: The guy in the black clothing is the same guy that started punching everyone for parking in his friend’s spot
This is basically the ending to every fairy tail episode
hahaha I rarely see him look straight in the camera during a skit  lol
NOOOOO YOU"RE EXCEPPPPPTTIONAAAALL!!!
2:28 ....  What is up with ur mustache my man.
MHA in a nutshell
I wonder if caleb gets stuck in the last personality he records as lol
Yo I need info on that fat fox plush though 🦊
My man Caleb needs to colab with Prozd
this is like deku talking to all might Imao.
This gives me intense Rock Lee vibes
Frickin might guy
This is Deku from my hero academia😂
this is tanjuro
caleb when you were saying thank you over and over and we’re drooling you should have pored water and made it look like you were drooling a water bath lol.
Naruto Vibes, talk no Jutsu. "It's super effective" - Poke'mon
I really want to have one but I'm poor
I feel like he did something different in this video but I can’t pinpoint what it is. It is hilarious regardless, though
No one CalebCity: YoU ArE eXcEpTiOnAl
Why is this so accurate tho??!!😩😩😩😹😹
The beard makes you look like a typical villain, but besides insulting you I fricking loved the video hilarious, literally laughed the second the first joke started
I was tearing up at that key speech
Should’ve just ended him when he was screaming in his sleep.
my tummy hurts
I felt this
This does remind me of one time i was drunk and trying  to find the remote and couldn't so i called my friend and fucking pinpointed it and he wasnt at my place that day
i've been waiting for this kind of video at last ALL HAIL CALEB
😂😂😂😂
The hat covering his eyes at that angle was so accurate tho
You look like you lost some weight. Hope you're doing ok 💛
Please notice me Caleb it would really make my day
what was he screaming about in the end? I couldn't hear what his friend said over his screaming
Alternate title: That one emotional friend    Also I was expecting him to make a motivational speech at the end XD
The fact that this man was so annoyed he looked into the camera 2:22
When konohamaru talked to Naruto:
"YOU'RE NOT TRAAAASH!!" rofl
What an odd moment this is when it happens
He did such a good job I didn’t even wanna watch it
This is kaido from Saiki K. to a tee
Litterally anyone who meets Luffy in One Piece
how anime’s drag out and ruin most fight scene:
HXH be like
Might Gai and Rock lee be like
Rock lee be like
"It's cool. It's keys."
2:20  Whats going on with them feet
Oh my God I got drunk last night and did this exactly as he did. I’m so embarrassed I feel like you are making fun of me.  WAIT Σ(-᷅_-᷄๑)  ARE YOU PSYCHIC (΄◉◞౪◟◉｀)
All that’s missing is that swing from Naruto
Villain Backstory
This is hilarious man
caleb ur da best yt u post orignal content i luv u
He should've been on the mic with people listening like, "yo, what you watching in the background? I hadn't seen that one. "  "Hey bruh, turn yo TV down." "Why this man got 2 tvs in the same room? " "You idiot! That's probably that man's laptop or phone."
HxH and One Piece be doin this all the time
Crying at 3am about upcoming exams is actually not limited to anime characters
Nobody:  Naruto Starting a fight: Rasnegan Barrage! *misses*   Naruto: ''you dont have to do this''
Caleb a 100 thieves fan tooooo!!!!
Midoriya Izuku AF, honestly. (Not hating on the character)
“You’re nootttt trashhhhh!!!!” 😂🤣😂😂 BRUh I lost it LMFAOOOOOOOOO
accurate
Pssh Anime characters, always so dramatic
I थॉट धे वर डिफ़्रेंट पीपल lol
One piece be like
Bro having his head down while he talked was the Cherry on top
This channel is lyfe
this one is my fave so far
Nice 100 Thieves hat
i swear, caleb has subs that have notifications on just to come here and dislike when a new video drops
You know he really means it if his hat covers his eyes     Also, I make skits if you wanna um check em' out.
Naruto and Sauske if they lived together
*Naruto
He forgot "If you give up on this game I will NEVER FORGIVE YOOOOOOUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!"
I thought the last piece was going to be an motivational thanks too
thank uuuuu <33 , ur videos always make me laugh when im having a bad day 🥺🥺🥺🥺
This is literally midoriya from My Hero
The look down with the hidden eyes is so accurate 💯💯💯💯
It"s naruto and sasukeee. Right ???
The 100t product placement though... #heist
early
that fire ass beat
MAXIMUM cringe lol!
Literally any shonen mc
0:17 the way he opened the drawer tho
"TAKE IT BAAAAACK"😂😂😂
This man even covered his eyes, genius
Rock Lee in a nutshell
Literally Naruto
this is why most anime’s are shit
Neighbours: He's giving himself motivational speeches now.
This is Midoriya 💯
Babe babe wake up new CalebCity Video😩

You're not traaaaaaaaash!!!! 😂😂😂😂

Tomioka: okay I won’t kill he-  Tanjiro: THANK YOU! YOU’RE ALWAYS THERE FOR PEOPLE AND NEVER TALK DOWN ON OTHERS! I SWEAR TO BE AS GOOD AS YOU ONE DAY! (crying)  *Tomioka: my nigga i am depressed.*
Sakura
So accurate 😂
this is me trying to be purposely annoying, and wow. I'm annoying 😅
One piece be like
Caleb really do be gettin them anime gasps on point!
LMFAO 😂😂😂
Doesn't Spongebob do this sometimes?
You shouldv’e folded him that woulda made it more funny
I was waiting for a "Now I'm bout to slide you, I'm bout to slide you!" 😆
This reminds me of deku
Deku and tanjiro Everytime somebody says "hello"
Rock Lee 😂😂😂😂
Nobody’s going to talk about his feet on the couch
mums that turn everything into a life lesson
Midoriya and Naruto
Bro why he looking down the whole time lmao. So accurate
The 100 thieves hat 👀
Gon be like:
Hey video is good and accurate and all but how do I cop those fox plushes though 👀
Just wanted to say, I haven't been watching your content for long but you're one of the youtubers I enjoy the most.
XD why is this a fact?! High-key every anime
basically speedwagon to johnathan joestar everytime he takes a breath
Lol one piece background music
Jankos vibe
Since 13
007
Attack on titan lmfao
3rd time watching this     *every nine minutes*
Why is this Midoriya to all might?
This man has me dying every time! 🤣
Literally allmight and deku.
He even covers the characters eye until they start crying
2:31 Caleb is like look at this dude
Mark is wikied
0:49 deku to allmight
Is anyone gonna talk about how he has a 100 thieves hat? Hmm jus me?
This is like Izuku talking to All Might haha
This is me and and my friends in the library...
Naruto in a nut shell  I WILL BE HOKAGE, BELIEVE IT!!!!
lmao it literally sounds like that one character from one peice
The cap/hair covering the face is so accurate.
That rem motivational speech though was best episode ever imo
Omg that's me in my head 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣☮️🧡
Can someone get this Anime Protag therapy? Like, the dude really needs some help.
Talk no jitsu in its finest
Ahiru no Sora
i legit have a friend like this
IKR
1:09 my will to live vs my depression
This is pretty much all of naruto
Armin
This hurts to watch.
So it’s basically Naruto when his rasengan doesn’t work.
I see you with the 100 Thieves hat!
At 1:55 I had to double take like YOOO Caleb you need help bruh?! Them some caveman ass feet till I realized it’s his socks 🤣🤣🤣
That weaboo that took it personally
Image these two guys playing Dark Souls
Props to this man for his editing and cinematography.
“ do do do”
why you throwing shade at lee like that
He has no doubt watched my hero acedamia
Its so fucking true
*Naruto and Deku have entered the chat.*
What parents expect kids to say all time
ok but i wish i had a homie who said that to me when i talk down on myself
He genuinely didn't know how to handle the situation in the end🤣🤣
“YOU'RE NOT TRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASH” yo I’m done 🤣
‏ههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههه
pls do more Anime stoff. hahahahahah. this is DEKU HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH
bwahahahahha
Sounds exactly like naruto annoying speeches
Yo I'm done with the third one 😭😭 dude was screaming at himself at 3am
Who else still think Caleb has twins?😂
Caleb don’t miss
This how my friends see me. Gon stop
I've only watched 4 anime and this is still so tru
sometimes i forget that there aren't two characters and caleb plays both of them. he's that good.
So just to make sure, this is CANON right?
Real life version of asta from black clover
“The little did I know” kills me everytime 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I always enjoy guessing which Caleb is gonna do some stupid shit at the beginning of the sketch.
the way he opened the drawer though
The fact that his eyes are covered by the hat is so true. i know this isn't anime but this is like kingdom hearts when Sora talks to Riku
The first speech seemed like something from onepiece😂😂
Wake no grey screen at the end? Hmm
T H E    G A M E  ! ! !
I LAUGHED THE WHOLE VIDEO THIS IS SO TRUE 😂😂😂
Gurren Lagan inna nutshell
Why doesn’t this man have his own anime yet?
😂😂😂
Didn’t realize being Naruto’s friend was so hard. Kinda understand Sasuke now
When you’re roommates with Deku
Please don't trip celebs 😂
😂😂😂
Why is this so true tho😂
Guy Sensei: You know Lee what should we eat Lee: Ramen Guy sensei: I think we should eat Ramen! Lee: GUY SENSEI HOW DO YOU DO IT YOU HAVE SUCH A WAY WITH WORDS!! I PROMISE NEXT TIME ILL DO BETTER *flash back “hey I want to be a ninja the best ninja in the whole village even if I have no ninjitsu * I MADE A PROMISE AND I WILL DO BETTER NEXT TIME
The keys made me think of Sakura when she realizes how useless she is
Maaaan 🤣🤣 the exclamations, the head down while pouring you're heart out lmao. Literally crying
This is so accurate...he should edit himself with a lil sweat coming down his face.😂
the fact that he took the time to put his hat on when he got out of bed kills me
lol
I promise I’ll do better ... damn
Nobody:  Deku:
Yo this guy is funny he should make skits of funny stuff
"YOU'RE EXCEPTIONALLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!" 😭😭😭😂😂
I didnt even have to read the title to get this lol
All of My Hero Academia would be 10 minutes long if they didn't do this
Deke in a nutshell
You're so good at this, I hope you never stop.
one of your best ones,im a gamer
It's the type of characters or maybe people that I want to skewer on a barbed stick then hang them on a cold metal wall to defile as a sacrifice to the chaos god of excessive pleasures
Next up: the protagonist that cries about everything
You are the only black man I would date if I had the chance 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Caleb is one of the few people in the world that can make me physically laugh out loud.
I see you with the 100T cap!!
😂 😂 😂 😂
I miss vines
Bro why does Caleb sound like deku in the begining?
Bruh I’ve seen like 4 anime’s and this is Genos, Midoriya and Gon to a tee.
😂😂😂 This Was Fire Foo
THANK YOU     *DAMNNNNN*
That touched my ❤️ it's good when you talk to yourself about how great you really are and not let short bringings like the game baffle you ... Subscribe to my channel for more comedy soon 👌
Dichen Lachman is hot.

🤯🤯🤯🤯🔥💙😂
Thank you for making good content your not trash you're a good person you're my friend YOU'RE NOOOOT TRAASSSSH
Im dying. That is so true
I feel like I seen this anime already.
Caleb can't I get a free action figure?
This guy is so original i fucking love it
Every fucking 2 seconds in Naruto. Correction: Naruto's trash ass every 2 seconds in Naruto.
Damn I wish I had friends like this lmao
Hey I inceptes computer Twitter Munn. She could be in charge of me.
A lot of people are mentioning Midoriya here in the comments but he isn't really like this.   Did you guys miss the part where they actually fought?  He helps out everyone.  Heck, he helped Todoroki out more
You’re exceptional!!!
Krillin ass boi, hahahahahaa. Good shit
Midoriya to bakugo
ive seen caleb go from a shitty, run down house. To this baller ass chad house
Every Ff and Kh game ever
Deku in a nutshell
For yu have different personalities
I won’t even be friends with them anymore fr
The stare at the end before the outro feels like he is extremely disappointed in me
can you imagine being Caleb neighbor when he is making videos? They got to hate him
I hate moments like this it just ruins the anime so much
Lol
AND YOUR MY FRIEND  🤣🤣🤣
I am so getting ya figure.. But it will take like forever to come to ma country from USA...anyway,  amazing video as always
If this ain't Gon and Killua then idk what is
I GOT 2 ADS IN A ROW!!!!! ASDDHKF
I love watching ur vids my guy
So this was the arc where his friendship with Cameron was truly established, before he started hitting random people on the streets?
Plot twist, the motivational speeches are coming from Cameron. Caleb hasn’t been able to get rid of him since he tried to kill Caleb’s neighbor for parking in Caleb’s spot.
Shots fired Deku and Naruto
Always when it's about games somehow the videos include Caleb being mad towards the games.  Or something bad always happens, that could be the reason too
Jesus Christ 🤣
I haven't laughed that hard in a good while. Damn the creativity on these skits.
I just realized how he was probably thinking about how annoying crossing over his own voice so he had to argue with him screaming at himself
... Put the pillow in the description
Yo bro, you find your homie screaming motivational speeches in his sleep, you best go comfort him and let him know he ain't alone. If you don't, how can you call yourself a real homie?
pp
My hero in nutshell
I cried laughing
you're the best
When he looked at the camera, I was very uncomfortable
This is just...  amazing.
Can you heart me bro?
Keep goin 😣 From anime World 😏💔
My Hero Academia in a nutshell.
When the nigga started screaming about the keys it brought me to tears literally like sad tears idk why, shit was funny tho good shit Caleb
Yup love yourself first Caleb you're good person! Yes such inspiration!
Naruto be like-
The way he screams being overly dramatic be having me dead😂😂💀
😹😹😹😹😂 The truth in this is so heavy
Have you not been sleeping or are your allergies acting up? Either way, feel better.
Ok but can someone tell me where the fox plush is from it’s cute...
Caleb at the motivational Caleb: GET OUTTTTTTTTTTTT
We’re all thinking deku right?
Midoriya be like:
Yep, I got the Deku and Naruto vibes I wuz looking for.
Did you mean: Izuku Midoriya?
:)
I started cringing first 30 seconds oh boy, gonna be a great time 😂 😂❤️❤️
Deku: **Is trying to win a fight against Todoroki** Todoroki: **isn't using his full power** Deku: *_TRY YOUR BEST!!! ITS YOUR POWER NOT HIS!!!! YOU CANT EXPECT TO WIN THIS THING WITH HALF YOUR POWER!!!! I WANNA SEE YOU DO YOUR BEST!!!!_*
Naruto being like 👁👄👁
Deku: **trips on a rock in front of All Might** All Might: You okay, young Midoriya? Deku: ALL MIGHT I PROMISE TO DO BETTER YOURE SO AMAZING I SWEAR ILL BE JUST LIKE YOU ONE DAY!
Naruto af
This reminds of a certain series.
I never knew I was an anime character 😂
this video is exceptional
Bruh the smash click is so distinct I didn't even need to see the controller
Hi
I hate when they do that
Alot of people are saying BNHA, but this is really more like Haikyuu!!
This mans just saying the whole bible
😂😂😂
Motivational speeches in anime are why i dont like anime because they just do it too much
Caleb's neighbors at 3am being motivated 😎📈
Deku
Lol
I can't breath 🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂
TAKE IT BAAAAAACK
Nah this is Naruto
Koichi kun you are truly a reliable guy 😂
Lmfaooo these videos give me life
New house?
I feel like I'm watching One Piece
0:25 the drama starts here 🤣
Naw that’s just how girls talk.
why did i think of my hero acadamia 3 seconds after reading the title ?
This is basically Speedwagon every time he’s with Jonathan.
Caleb 1: *dealing with constipation* Caleb 2: You've pushed through harder things in life! You've got this!
😭
Lmao this is actually so good
I mean at least he’s being nice ya know
bruh shouldnt attack my hero academia like that...
It's not an anime  motivational speech without the tears and the closed fist.
No one   Fairytale: the power of friendship!!!!! Random boost of power
Sasuke and Naruto be like:
YOURE EXEPTIONALLLLLLLLLL  WRAAAAAAAAAAAAGH
If this isn't naruto
Me: *Playing fetch with my dog, dog brings ball back*  Also me: “You see, this is why you are such a great friend. You are always there for me, always listening for what I need, all for nothing in return but my company. Your selflessness and cheerfulness are unmatched, and I will forever admire you. *YOU ARE EXCEPTIONAAA—”*
😂😂😂 is this me?😂😂😂💀
The SECOND he started shouting “Thank you” all I could hear and see was “Arigato! Arigato gozaimasu!!” with a few tear droplets floating in the breeze against an intensely colored background. This thing needs an anime trigger warning.
🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🕺🏾😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💆🏾‍♂️😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😐I literally laughed beginning to end
Oh,so you finally watched Naruto.
Did he literally wait till 3:00 a.m. to make that ending for this video XD this dude's going places
Was watching naruto when I got the notification and naruto was in the middle of some talk no jutsu.
😂
😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
This is a black rock lee
asta in a nutshell
This is me all the time
YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAAAAALLLLLL... TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAAAAAAIIIIID
“It’s coo. It’s *keys.”* 💀
2:20 deku be like

Love you Bro!
I can bet you anything that I can turn food into motivation
Izuku in a nutshell
When you realize I just bought all the youtooz left
You really gonna call Deku out like this?
1:50 Are we all just gonna ignore Calebs Big Ass Feet
The look to the camera at the end stole my soul out my body fam lol 😂😂😂
I am not your daaaad
Ok I need dayquil to wake him up and nightquil to make sure he sleeps without all that screaming
Yo CalebCity you should've made one part where he slaps him and he starts to apologize so dramatically
I like how Caleb is wearing a cap even at 3am lol
I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who that kind of shit in anime was fucking cringe as hell.
I'ma say what we're all thinking: DEKU
POV: You’re Sasuke
No one gonna talk about how a cap magically appeared under his blanket.
Imma head out, makes video in 10 seconds
i love how he has a *100 thieves* hat on at 3am.
That one weeb roomate:
I guess the real friends were the speeches we made along the way
Lololol I don’t even watch anime but the couch scene is hilarious.
😂😂
Reminds me of hunter x hunter (Gon) 😭
Man so true 👍👍😂😂😂
Its just keeeeeys
DEKUUUUU
Why did he open the drawer like that
Is it normal that I do this in real life??? 🤪🤣😂😅
This reminded me of MHA so much.
the brim covering the eyes 💀💀
Gon to killua :  Also  Killua to gon:
“You’re not TRAAAAASH! You’re EXCEPTIONAAAAALLLL!”
"its good to see a student i once thought has a friend who would do things with great lengths for his sake" ~iruka sensei
This is naruto to sauske
I'm fukin dead
Alternate title : How Naruto's enemies see him as after fighting him
It really do be like that though.
Lowkey crying in both senses
Alternate title: That one character in nearly ever One Piece arc.
Naruto-Sasuke vibes ?! Anyone?
Kingdom Hearts be like:
I know a lot of anime does this, but man this is basically every character in Seven Deadly Sins
Lmao ❤
Naruto is proud
Him motivating himself while he was on the couch got me crying
Imagine him when something important really happens like does he just not care or does he start crying about how great a friend he has
This is how my overprotective friends be when I call myself trash
FAIRY TAIL BE LIKE
It’s okay you can say Deku from My Hero
0:23 Caleb 1: Thank you... Caleb 2: Yep. Gotchu.. Caleb 1: THANK YOU... Caleb 2: -__-
Can we congratulate caleb for posting 4 days after his last video
Man SHUT UP 😂😂😂😂
*YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAL*
“It’s just keys” 😭
When makes a speech he kinda of sounds like deku
This was so accurate 😂 the voice crack had me rollin
This is channel is one of the og/best channels out there that we have to protect!
Deku.
You know, I was actually expecting at the last part of the video. for you to hit yourself after the third time.
Yah you came back with it bro this was good
It really do be like that tho

*deku*
Rock Lee be like...

NARUTO *Vibes*
You are a very intelligent and adorable human! 😁🌈
This is exactly why I didn't like Elizabeth in seven deadly sins lmao
This mans neighbors wondering what the f goin on.

Haiku in a nutshell

Optimus: My fellow Autbots....

Caleb throwing subtle shots to get in 100T
That one friend you hate and like at the same time
asta / naruto/ deku type beat
Your poor neighbors 💀💀💀
Anyone getting Midoriya vibes from this.... No ok
Don’t know bout y’all, but I just took the most motivated shower ever.
All Might: Hey kid you okay? Deku: I PROMISE I WILL BE AS GREAT AS YOU ONE DAY ALL MIGHT! WHEN I SAVE PEOPLE I WILL ALWAYS DO IT WITH A FEARLESS SMIL-
So basicaly naruto
All I could think of here is Deku lmao
Lol I was dying! Mannnnnn the accuracy.
Why you gotta wear a hat at 3am lol
That camera stare though
Yup I've watched enough anime to confirm this is realistic af. I'm not fond of it in the slightest
He really into his acting
Naruto be like
Is Caleb okay? https://youtu.be/HBspxazENC8
I feel like anime is a everyday documentary in Japan
is that great having friends like that?
You forgot the part where they power up into a new level after*
FINALLY! THANK YOU
Izuku Midoriya be like😂😂
naruto and rock lee in one video
Naruto would like to know your location
*insert Katara touching her mother's necklace*
This is literally me
You been watching Haikyuu!! Huh? 😂
Were these videos always in 4k 60?
His hat is supporting rouge company  The event 100 thieves
Deku in a nutshell
*Rent a girlfriend main character in a nutshell*
The second part w the games was stupid 😂 funny
This is almost exactly like watching Naruto giving a motivational speech to Sasuke
0:23 Caleb:THANK YOU Other Caleb:ahh shit here we go again
"oh shoot I lost my keys, let me go check the pantry"
"You're not stupit! Don't ever say you're stupit!"  -that friend
is your throat ok?
I kept thinking this as Chrome and Senku from Dr. Stone XD With Chrome obviously being the one giving motivational speeches.
This is... Surprisingly accurate 😂
bro how the fuck is caleb so funny THIS IS KILLING MEEEEE 💀
My hero  in a nut shell
*Looks at jojo, looks away*
This shit is hella funny
This is why I like Goku lmao. You never see him do shit like this 😂
You know they about to go in on a speech when their eyes are hidden
Name an anime character you hate. I'll start, Takami Chika
“DAYUM” 😭😭😭
THAT'S SO TRUUUUEE, ALL THE DAMM TIME 🙄🙄🙄
Lol
This feels like a Deku callout post
I only hear Naruto this entire time
This must be Cameron's origin story
1:08 basically me when i fail from one inch to Victory.
Basically black clover lol
i just watched hxh and naruto in 3:08 minutes?
I rii here dying laughing and dead mad of how this bui so annoying🤣🤣🤣
I swear to God, I don't understand how you are consistently killing EVERY DAMN SKETCH!  #Genius #Legend
Caleb sounds like that dude that says, His gear, wack, His life, wack.. 😂
IT'S JUST KEYS
i nearly lost it when he screamed THANK YOU!!!
What did my uncle tell me again?! Lmao
Dude I feel like every anime I watch is exactly like this
This is the opposite of having an anime villain in your house.
This definitely needs a sequel
Basically what the title says
Why does it always happen in every Anime
BRUUUUHHH THIS SHIT ACCURATE MY GUY 😂😂
Caleb you should Make a gaming channel
I'm gonna need a Playlist of all the sounds he makes
One of the most annoying tropes in anime that and expo dumps
*Deku right now* ...you’re right. My motivational speech was trash Caleb. But I promise... 𝗜 𝗪𝗢𝗡’𝗧 𝗟𝗘𝗧 𝗬𝗢𝗨 𝗗𝗢𝗪𝗡 𝗔𝗚𝗔𝗜𝗜𝗡𝗡𝗡𝗡𝗡𝗡𝗡𝗡𝗡....!
Is this midoriya?
It got to the point where he started to get mad, instead of feeling appreciated.
Absolute madman
Anime captain America be like
Lol anime moments
Anyone notice that 100T hat 🔥
Why he coming for midoriya like that tho😂

https://youtu.be/ejZvQrSLxNM Rahasia ayah dan ibu dari anos voldigoad

After watching this guy for years I can say these types of videos are much funnier after you actually watch anime
So this is what its like being friends with Naruto....
Clearly Ozda from black clover
What do you think their neighbors think when they hear this stuff
This is actually so accurate
Is this an attack on Naruto?  And no, i wasn't trying to make a pun with "attack on" titan.
You could've just said the video is about Midoriya
Naruto flashback
100% Deku 😂😂😂😂
We lookin at you Uzumaki
1. Whenever anyone does anything for me. 2. Whenever any of my friends say anything remotely negative about themselves. 3. Whenever I’m up at 4am, wondering why my parents are disappointed.
Anyone: *Does anything*  Deku: *ON THE VERGE OF TEARS.* "THANK YOU!!!!!!!!"
lmao nice vid
I bet this guy loves when he has to scream lmao
Imagine if u save his life.
Hey you,stop scrolling.....     YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

Nobody: Anime characters: *cries in motivation*
Naruto vibes

It's the hat covering the eyes for me
1:04 BABY FOX PLUSHIE 🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️
Basically every time Asta speaks in black clover

Elizabeth from 7 deadly sins
2:22 Wassup homie
Literally eren In a nutshell
2:22 😳Is he uh looking at us???
Guess I'm an anime character because no way am I letting people talk bad about my friends, especially my friends
ngl this is kinda wholesome
This man really gave me some Deku vibes geez
I finally figured out why this doesn't happen in jojo, they all have PLOT ARMOUR
Bakugo: Isn’t angry Midoriya: What’s wrong friend, don’t worry whatever your feeling sad about don’t worry about it as everyone thinks your the best person so you don’t have to worry about anything
He's so done that he broke the 4th wall
Next request: anime characters talking so far between each other, or anime characters talk without facing each other (back to back)
Such truth.
Me at my friends all the time
Is it sad that youtubers are my only friends right now?
he caleb can i have it for free
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Why do I play this game? I'm trash!"  That's literally me when I'm playing Smash XD.
Wait he's in 100 thieves?
Okay but why is nobody talking about the cute huge fox plushies at 1:01?
Calebcity, I love you channel man, u give me hope that HUMANITY still exists dudeee, you single-handedly make people's life worth living boyyyy, promise me u will always be proud of yourself, PROMISE IT, SAY IT, GODAMMIT!!!! DON'T EVER FORGET THAT !!!!!
Honestly, I would pay so much to be Caleb's neighbor xD
That was funny😂
You should do a video about how Batman obliterates his enemies then says “NOW TALK”
This video is too true i cringed
"YOU'RE NOT TRAAAAASH!!!" really hit different
izuku midoriya....thats all ima say
that eye contact surprised me
Ngl I wish I had someone to cheer me up like that when I suck at a game xS 1:02
burh this is too funny 😂😂😂
His feet lol 😭😭😭
The hat covering the eyes is proof that this true (3k likes hey's that's awesome!)
The yelling got me good 😂😂😂
I think this is his best one!
Like every Naruto  character ever
My hero academia
I knew it was coming, I saw the title, and yet I still lost my shit when he started the speech. The music was perfect.
Yo y'all know me
At the end his friend become his enemy

You forgot the “Ever since we we kids...” tangent that comes with a flashback sequence
Deku
Talk no jutsu
This is why I only watch certain types of anime of what I like
Broo post dam u need to post ahgghgghhhhhhh
this the kind of dude who has a heart attack when he accidentally spills a grain of salt on the ground
Lol
This video is so cringe it’s TRUE😂😂
This is one of the best ever.
😂😂😂😂
Better than people who turn everything into an unmotivational speech right?  I used to know some guy who you could say anything and it would remind him of some fucked up story of something that happened to him XD
That's deadass Deku
100T Hat ???
Caleb been watching too much griffy 😂
Calebcitys new vid..... If the people in the medicine ad can here the guy talking about the side effects of the medicine
00:43 when he looked up in the camera kind of lingered on his face below the eyes - that it’s a nice attention to detail   (Or you were too close to the camera lmao but it works either way)
Nobody at all: Naruto:You’re Not Trash😂
how does he not laugh doing these? 😭✌️
Basically rock lee
Good video. Made me laugh.
This video should be called “Naruto in a nutshell”
1:41 had me sleep
Sakura?? Lmao
Bruh.
That figure is so cute 😂
This 3 minute long video has all the positive vibes I need for this day.
He forgot the part where the friend says they’ll do everything together.
My boy stressing about the exam he has tommorow.... On Saturday morning
Naruto be like:
The chick in the bear & the boy XD
When he found the keys:   (anime grunts)   👁👄👁 “thank you”
Naruto, you got something to say?
U forgot the part where they punch the ground and the whole ground cracks.
Ha! I still remember that my friend start giving emotional speech right after I buy food for him hahaha
Turn to your Creator for eternal joy and peace now and forever! call upon the name of Jesus Christ for your salvation. seek for Him and  Live for Him amd you will have abundant life now and forever.
Yo your mad funny Caleb I just wanna say yea keep it the good work I can relate on almost all your skit it’s funny asf

This is so accurate.
Nah, thank you Caleb.
Asta in the black Bulls house
The power of friendship in anime
every character in my hero
What's wrong with someone lifting your moral. I won't mind him keep talking even if I'm just playing a game
This had me screaming at 5am xD
I love how he’s been using the same soundtrack for so many years
Naruto vibes, we needed some of them good vibes tho LOL! Still funny asf xD!
Get this man an Emmy or a Tony or something.
So is nobody gonna talk about his dirty ass socks
Just realized CalebCity has the same voice as Adam Driver
I thought this was actually my hero academia for a second
Nobody: Anime character starts crying: Me: what tf you for
this is sooo good!
this is why i stay away from shonen.
"Alright that's all I got. BOOM 💥"  He should end every video like that now. It was cool
Those are some expensive thermostats you got there Caleb
Caleb sick for waking up at 3 in the morning, fully dressed, and then putting on a hat.
Dude you gotta do the super hero interview 3 lol.
I love the outro beat so much. I need the instrumental lol
I hate that so much. That's why I stopped watching MHA, for everything it has going on, that show is too damn happy, and almost all the characters be the motivators instead of just one. I'm not asking for edgy angst, but I just need an episode to end without some motivational stuff just once.
What is the AEO Damage stand for in the figure? I only know of AOE Damage lol
Fairy Tail in a nutshell
*TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAAAAAIIID*  *TAKE IT BAAAAAACCCCCCKKKK*

I find it cute and wholesome when characters talk about how much they appreciate their friends. Idk :/
This also sounds like CalebCity’s comment section on YouTube. But Caleb, you ARE exceptional!
That's how it is man just like that you just can't find your keys!
3:20 a.m. oh yeah we would have the box are you going to run me that fade this early in the morning you tripping like that s*** oh yeah
As a weeb, this seems accurate
This is the reverse of a Long Beach griffy video
Freak
Did Caleb really wake up at 3:00 in the morning for this skit?  Yoo 66 likes
When he started waffling when he was asleep i started too die 😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂
i’ve watched your videos enough to know it’s a wrap when the piano starts playing
That's Naruto simping for sasuke level video.
*cough* genos *cough*
How is good at the second part but that third one when you looked at the camera oh my God it was almost like you were saying who's man is this
( me at 3am nursing the baby stopping her from waking up the house dead tired ) I'LL MAKE MY FAMILY PROUD OF ME. I'LL  SUCCEED BECAUSE I HAVE TO! !!!! I  AM NOT TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!
I just everyone here to know that you're exceptional.

Reminds me of Deku from MHA
Dude was so annoying he broke the 4th wall
Caleb bro your Remarkable acting never ceases to amaze me my dude. You’re going higher than the stars one day keep it up 💯
This is facts! It happened in Hunter X Hunter, Soul eater, The promised neverland, and My hero academia😂😂😂🤣🤣
When you love food wars but your roommate can't stand the extra drama😂it's not the nudity that bothers her, just the emotions
:D today’s my b-day and I woke up ready for a new video to drop and this made my day 😂😂😂
Yo this is 100% true lol. Like Titans and My Hero lol
2:23-2:29 keep putting your finger over where the sound comes out and keep taking it off and listen.😂😭
Yoo this joint was funny😂 one of the better skits recently imo. Keep up the grind Caleb
CalebCity: When your friends are too down for you (before)

This gonna be all of us trying to repair our social status when pandemic ends
Man, if I had an anime friend that pumped me up like this when I felt down, my depression would be gone af. PMA is cool.
Naruto in a nutshell
Ahahhahah YOURE EXCEPTIONAL
Wow I’m actually early but I’m pretty late
1:10 / 3:07  Anime characters that turn EVERYTHING into a motivational speech.
Take back what you said!!!!!😂😂😂😂
Im getting re:zero vibes
In the begging i immediately thought of Sakura
I wish i had this type of friends  Or any actual friends at all. 1:40
Definitely Black Clover comes 2 mind
If only the presidential debates where like this
Deku type beat
Definitely talking about my hero
Rock Lee in a nutshell
Like when you upload you make me happy when I watch them thanks for being a good youtuber
yes
At 1:50 I thought those were deer feet lmao
Ewrin turning a suicide charge into a motivational speech be like:
Armin from attack on titan😂
This is 100% Haikyu. Couldn’t finish the anime simply because of this.
Only goku can't do this he is throw hands first
Might be your best video XDD
that's literally every disciple in every anime
what do you think of steve in smash?
This is like Deku talking to All Might
i wasnt ready for the feels
This would make a great idea for a comedy/parody style anime
bought <3
Thank you Caleb you are the best 😂😂 he literally does it all himself.
It’s always hard to believe that’s everyone in his skits are just him
this is so on point im crying actually crying REAL TEARS HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
That one girl in class who insults herself and all the simps start building her up
It's been so long since you've made a 3 part video
This was so retarded I had to skip through it 😂  Instant like
Man this shit is relatable
Haikyu?

This is like Genos when talking to Saitama
I need that fox plushie!
Naruto, smh my head
Naruto. XD
My boy white shirt Caleb fixing to be sacrificed for character development
you, griffy and rdc are the funniest youtubers NO CAP. every video you make is too good man.
Soldiers: so it doesnt matter if we listen to you or not?  Erwin: nope Soldiers: ight imma head out.
I wonder if his neighbors worry for him or just wait a couple days to see what he’s working on
That stare into the camera at the end man..........the agony
This is like almost every anime character💀
Naruto in a nutshell
The real hilarity is that this is so goddamn true and it annoys even me in my favorite shows. Naruto was the biggest culprit of this. Everything was a damn flashback with waterworks to go with it.
😂
his youtooz is going to the jar
Who's randomly found celeb city one day and watching him ever since
This nicca oc 😂😂😂ur exceptional
BTW BAKAGU ABOUT TO DIE
W youtooz
I really like anime but I hate it when the characters turn things into a motivational speech.
This happens in every episode of My Hero Academia, it's why I stopped watching lol
Caleb your so cool
Love this sketch. That anime main character def seems like he'd be a whiny type
“YOU’RE EXCEPTIONAL” “AAAAAAAAA”
Every anime ever 😂
That look at the camera sent me
midoriya
_Smirk_ . "You just don't get it... You'll never be strong. Because you are alone... And I have my friends. I HAVE SOMEONE TO FIGHT FOR."
We’ve been here from the start! Congrats man
Anime characters  *glasses are now white*
Caleb#1: *screams while in bed*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Caleb#2: *looks at camera* You're probably wondering how I got here
Kenpachi trying to explain why ichigo should just start fighting niggas for no reason  Edit: Mayuri’s speech on perfection also😭
2:28 he look like he wanna jump him 😂😂😂
Real life Deku and Bakugo.
This is literally every emotional shonen  protagonist in every shonen series lol
Deku when Bakugo threatens to kill him
1:51 this time demons possessed him
This is just me irl
At this point why are u even his friend
Caleb: a shit here we go again
Even the spit is on point
It’s either main character that’s a little kid or some little girl that looks up to the big brother. 😐
You could watch one anime and understand all of these comments
Forgot to put the part where all anime characters know how to use genjutsu making everybody see hour long flashbacks within a second
As a secondary thought, we're all laughing at this dude, but we all wish we had someone supporting us and telling us we're good enough like this.
NICE GUYS trying to hit on woman
We need to legit make a gofundme for Calebcity to get a crap ton of Tiles. He is always losing stuff lol.
Isnt the dude wit no eyes from a hentai
i died when he looked at the camera 😂😂😂
To be real, it would be nice to have someone be that passionate about you (and your abilities) when you feel like shit at a game.
Lmfao
We all have that one friend who do this
Yo, my mans is a 100 Thieves fan.
lmfaoooooo
This is clearly the prequel to when he becomes evil and starts beating up random people and trying to kill that one guy for taking his friend's parking spot.
That spit leak at 0:49 🤣
Bro I'm sorry but this was annoying Af
This is so true XD         P.s Love your vids! 💛
Deku vibes
Deku:

People still watch Anime even though Caleb has displayed every reason it’s trash
Deku and shota in a nutshell
The way he stared at the camera😂😂
TAKEE BACKK WHAT U SAIIDDD This dude reminds me of Asta from Black Clover😂😂😂
I've never watched an anime. This was still funny
Yo lowkey should have become a voice actor

You mean every time in Naruto, Fairy tail, and Bleach.
At the end I swear my man's was Rock Lee doing his famous speech agianst Gaara
Asta anytime he opens his mouth:
I probably need this friend, supporting me everyday, giving me speeches
Cough   MIDORIYA
Midoriya
"Its keys"
Where the sakura flower?
Where the sakura flower?
Elizabeth - seven deadly sins
Narutos lonely swing appears
I like how he's casually wearing that 100 Thieves hat...signing?
He woke up in 3 am just to shoot that 30 sec clip
LETS GO IM EARLY...*gets notification 5 hours late*
My hero academia in a nutshell
"YOU'RE NOT TRAAASSHHH!" 😭😂😂
He dont even wanna hear it
Miss u Caleb welcome back♥️
LMAO
Firee
Powerful motivational speeches "close eyes" "crunch fists" "just shout on top of your throat"  *I FELT ALL THAT*
Bro what are those socks 😂
it's okay, you can say *deku midoriya*
Asta smh
This is my little cousin
0:38  1:12 Ngl, They legit be doin that
I can't tell if he's acting or not....... 🙄
Bruh, at the end when the dude just trying to sleep and breaks into the 3rd dimension.
This is me irl tho
All might: *coughing up blood* Deku:*screams like a damn maniac*
This is spot on 😅
This is sooo true
Gon
Get  a Keysmart next time and you won't have to go through that
Basically Gon and Killua, bit Killua isn't gay.
I just cant help but think of Deku
Lol so real
Deku
the "uh" at 0:19 was the most animeish thing on this video
The fact that this is so true
Lmao
I swear Caleb is one of the best content creator 😂😂💀😁
Lol so true 😆 😂
This is so accurate lol
That’s just rock lee in any situation with his friends 😂
omg the fox toy 😭😭
Anime protagonist: YOU’RE EXCEPTIONAL...I MEAN IT!!!! Me: wow...thanks man. I’ve...i’ve never been told that b4 bro 😢😢
help i’m lost again
At this point he’s describing every movie ever
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why the last one sound like Deku 😂
"YOUR NOT TRASH!" "SHUT UP!!!"
He has cute pillow plushies 💕
100 thieves collab?   Or you just like the merch.
basically my hero academia then
aye where's Caleb video? Don't tell me he jus uploaded a Naruto clip 🙄
This gives me genos vibes
Lmao yo Caleb be killing me
Shut up! - how they want to respond
I Giorno Giovanna have a dream to give motivational speeches
Honestly wish my friends were like this.
LOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Mostly female characters who feel like they are a burden
so this how it feels huh.
Someone animate this
D E K U
Thank you. I am now complete.
If you guys can’t tell, Caleb watches a lot of anime
Only thing missing is going on the ground and screaming "THANK YOU! I AM SORRY TO HAVE PUT BLAME ON YOUR NAME!" or something like that lmao
“𝐘𝐎𝐔’𝐑𝐄 𝐄𝐗𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐀𝐋”
Every naruto battle that contributes to the plot be like:
thats so true
great video man lol. litteraly the trashiest and cringiest moments in anime
Ngl I felt that last one
Bruh this is me ,I feel cringey.
What was he doing at the end tho?
I COULD DOOO THISS !!!!!! Lmfao
"YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAL, TAKE IT BAAACK"
Eren, is that you?
Every Naruto episode
I'm the one that keeps making speeches... :/
Classic Calebcity 😂😂😂😂
VIDEO IDEA (When you play a game that is pay  to win)
That little gasp when you find the key was spot on, your acting is exceptional!
2021 we simpin for the homies
I don't know about you, but I could use a person to tell me I'm exceptional...
This wasn’t a video making fun of speeches, it was actually a video to show his love towards his viewers, all along.  We thought that after seeing his channel, his videos, for so long, that we would know that this was simply a parody, but we are better than that, we are smarter than that.  Caleb city is an exceptional friend, and we all need to realize this, maybe he has been trying to tell us this the whole time, but we never realized, no more will this go on.      Wait... am I in the video?
You're exceptional!!!  Shut up!!  You're exceptional!!!  Shut up!!!
"YOU'RE NOT TRASH!!!"
*COME BACK TO THE VILLAGE SASUGAY*
Is that 100 thieves merch i see👀
NOBODY               NARUTO
That's definitely naruto😅..
The funny thing is I knew a guy I used to be roommates with who used to talk like this in his sleep 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
............. Naruto
Why do I hear the dialogue in Japanese
100 thieves hat jeez
1:24 oh my god he SNAPPED this is the perfect parody. "Exceptional" is a great touch, makes me feel like I'm reading weirdly specific subtitles
"I can do this I'll make my family proud!" I was floored👏🏾👏🏾🤙🏾👏🏾👏🏾😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😭😭🤣
i need someone to scold me with kindness too.
If I buy a YouTooz, will he give me motivational speeches too?
Basically Deku in the UA Sports Festival against Todoroki
I won't stand for this My Hero Academia slander bro...
So you just gonna act like you weren't deku and bakugo
100 thieves hat  MY BOY!!!
Caleb: You are EXCEPTIONAL!!!   Neighbors: oh he started doing motivational videos now?
I thought it was going to be a 3 minute speech
Yo the speech just started I'm at 0:33 and I deadass got chills already The hat covering the eyes and the extremely emotional language is so spot on, I think I saw this scene in one piece like 5 times
Sinbad be like
The only character I thought of was Deku
Pack it up deku 🙄
Where's the classic scene "sad Naruto alone at the swing and everyone staring and talking about him"
You're welcome
anime character: gets his food eaten from the fridge   *this reminds me of the time where we had no food to eat*
The Youtooz is that one guy who got max lvl and can finally use that sword
All I could think of was Deku and Bokugo😭🤣
This is too damn accurate
Man get some sleep. Your eyes need some rest.
Damn boi he got that 500:1 like ratio doe look at that positive engagement babey zoo wee mama
that second thank you really cracked me up 😂
Relatable, i think we all got that one weird friend.
I Will Buy Calebcity Merchandise! I Haaavvee Tooooo!! Lol
“YOU’RE EXCEPTIONAAAAAALLL!!!!”
you Jim’d the camera lol
🤣🤣🤣 man they do that to make the episodes longer
This is literally My Hero Academia in a nutshell.
Amazing <3 Much love
Naruto IRL
Can someone name one anime that does this
"TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAID..TAKE IT BACK!"
Literally Naruto
bro you cant tell me he didnt say aint this about a b.... 2:23
The faces this dude makes are hilarious 😂.
You broke the 4th wall
This is just incredible 😂😂
I love how annoyed he is from him. I always say I'm trash when I get mad but I never have anyone to tell me I'm not trash.
Is this Attack On Titan
1:07: Me playing against a Falco in Slippi
Just another reason why I hate anime
When he looked into the camera I lost it
why at 8am i haven’t gone robbed yet
My hero academia live action
This made me Smile😄😊😄
Him:  You’re my best friend... Me:  No you’re not... Him:  Yes and I’m gonna make it up to you one day. Me:  WTF
he pulled a longbeach griffy 😂
This is literally Naruto irl
swear this fairy tail
All might: Hands Midoriya a tissue Midoriya: You are the most compassionate person i’ve ever met
Naruto be like
That Caleb boy next door needs help
BRUH you looking at the camera TOOK. ME. OUT.
How many episodes has he raged at a video game? XD
Deku and Almight in a nutshell
Deku be like...
🤣🤣🤣
3.4 Million subscribers and all he did was talk to himself
Giorno Giovanna in a nutshell
I love your vids bro but I live in poverty day by day would like one but not going to happen 😩👍
The fact that I can’t see his face most of the time he’s talking makes this 10x more accurate
1:15 are those socks or ashy ass feet
Did he sign to 100thieves y’all?
The way he opened the drawer with two hands made me uncomfortable
Lmao 😂 he never miss
This is a low key flex that he has a friend
It’s just Keys !! 🤣🤣🤣
Hey i had a friend like that that everytime i failed at something or i was very down he always gave those motivational speeches, he even did the head downwards thing. Poor guy got hit by a truck during one of his speeches about me wanting to get a drivers lisence but failing time and time again. he said "Everyone can drive.... EVERYO---" and then he got hit. R.i.p dude, eventhough i forgot your name.
Myheroacademia.avi  Just once, I'd like a fight scene where they just shut the fuck and punch each other.
Imagine if this was in a love romance anime I wonder how calebs motivation character would be and how it would affect the anime
This is exactly how I see Deku
This is why I hate deku!
BUT HE REALLY MEANS ITTTTTTTTTTT
2:10 ILL MAKE MY FAMILY PROUD!!!   *begins crying hysterically*
This is basically naruto
2:20 when the anime character gets tired of hearing the motivator he breaks the 4th wall and looks at the camera
That youtooz looks dope
AOT characters when they about to die or have been saved.
Deku does this all the time no cap
“You’re exceptional”  “AHHHHHH”
I died when that paino started playing @ 1:15
😂😂
this dude put on his hat just to check on his friend
Reppin the 100 thieves!!
This is definitely My Hero Academia characters lol
Every anime
Tis I.
We don't deserve friends.
This is hilarious!😂
When the main character does not want that much inspirational power :
(Naruto)
That’s subaru 😪
🤣🤣🤣
This is funny because this is literally how they act. 😂
Monologuing while crashing on the couch with the spare blankie 😂😂
SAVE A YOUTOOZ FOR ME PLEASE IM GETTING MONEY FOR MY BIRTHDAY IN 19 DAYS DONT SELL THEM OUT YET LEAVE A SINGLE ONE TO ME
LMAOOOO
Ok boi, chill! Iz just sum keys.
Naruto: allow me to introduce myself
Cue chihayafuru 1, 2 and 3.
This is what we call LEGIT
Even if I saw it on instagram, I will come back and watch it here 😂
I knew it this was going to take a turn when I couldn’t see his eyes
Lmao yoooo I’m weak you’re exceptional had me fucking dying
hi
Anime character: *finds a tooth*  Also anime character: *i can remember when me and my friend lost our first tooth when we were young. I miss him. I will kill the one that murdered him, even if it costs me my life!*
Bruh. This is gonna be out of no where but its nice to see someone else with the same amount of facial hair as I do. Solid
I'm sorry but this is Naruto
It hurts how accurate this is lmao.
Tht like to dislike ratio thoo 😁👍🏾
It was only a matter of time before the CW got Caleb
This like - dislike ratio is one of the best I've seen
So basically Naruto
1:41 lmboooo when words don’t do it for you
Filler style: TALK NO JUTSU!!!
Bahhahaha this is so funnny lmao
Naruto monologues
Him screaming on the couch lmao
I wish someone would say to me *“YOU’RE NOT TRAAAASHH”*
This is Deku
Fellas we gotta do better and motivate ourselves and our homies (which in his case is the same thing IG) every day
imagine saying "you are such a good friend" to yourself
I’LL NEVER LOSE (A FIGHT) MY KEYS AGAIN!!!
This reminds me of attack on titan
This is wrong. Where's the motivational background music ?
Luffy watching like 😐
Damn this gives off big Tatsumi vibes
"I was looking for the keys but I already found them... you were the key to my life"
Why is Caleb always having his ass beat in his games XD
“No, YOU’RE breathtaking!”
Its been some time since i had a good laugh xD
This is every “slice of life” anime summed up in 3 mins 😂
I heard "I can't poop because of exams tomorrow" at first.
When you scold your little sibling for being annoying and you told him his adopted  Your little sibling be like 1:45
Really expected him to say 'I found  the key and that key is our friendship '
This is less main character and more Hinata talking about Naruto lol
“I promise I’ll do better”   Sounds like 100 Thieves every year
Accurate. And I LIVE for it.
no wonder sasuke was so annoyed with naruto
Nailed it!
Shadow over eyes. Perfect. Also your neighbours 😂
legit he sounded just like naruto except without the "I WANNA BE HOKAGE ONE DAY BELIEVE IT"
AYO THE PIZZA HERE!
Alt title: Naruto @ Every single character
*ahem naruto* *ahem fairy tail* *ahem black clover*
He just didn’t care about the 4th wall at the end
Antagonist Confirmed!
0:49 I saw that LUL
I cried
https://youtu.be/oUmOpSHZGGA
Nature and sasuke relationship
Random Dude: Hey want a free jacket? MC: That Jacket, IT WAS THE SAME ONE MY FRIEND HAD BEFORE HE DIED! HE LIVES ON IN ME! HE IS LOOKING AFTER ME FROM THE GRAVE!!!!
2:22 that made me feel like he was actually watching me...
Now if this was in Japanese he’d be all the way on point 🤣🤣🤣
Accurate
are we not gonna talk about this mans feet? 2:20
“YOURE EXCEPTIONALLLLLL” needs to be a ringtone lmfao
Justin Y is somewhere here...
Bruh, you get people like this in real, all dramatic and making promises and stuff, when real problems show they're no where to be found
There weren’t any flashbacks so I don’t know how accurate this is
That’s on you for picking Naruto as a roommate😂
Everyone needs one of these guys, but a little less melodramatic. I too am a motivational speaker and i know others can be too, EVERYONE IS A GOOD PERSON IF THEY JUST *TRY* , I LOVE EVERYONE AND EVERYONE SHOULD LOVE EACH OTHER, WE ARE NOT BETTER THAN THE OTHER, IF YOU ARE DOWN AND CAN'T CONTINUE ON REMEMBER YOUR FRIENDS  AND THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU THEY WILL GIVE YOU STRENGTH TO CONTINUE NEVER GIVE UP, YOU ARE LOVED.
MC: YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAL!!  Keanu: You're breathtaking!  MC: NO! YOU'RE BREATHGIVING!!
I literally do this
DANG, I finally realise how saitama must feel about genos.
2:22 i fucking died gg
Yo if this isn’t Midoriya...
me @ all your videos: this is your best work
Immediately, I died.
THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA KILL THE SPEAKER AND THE SPEAKER WAS GONNA MOTIVATE WHILE BEING MURDERED
It's amazing how he can make the conversation in his skits so natural. Love his work
killua with gon lets not cap
"Yo I was supposed to post today, one sec."  *Pog*
Not gonna lie, a friend like that is someone I will protect and care about the most
I love how he screams in sorrow that he's gonna make his family proad that shows how much of a failure his family think he is.
This is accurate
Re zero kara 2ed s  :)
POV: this is your roommate
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 this is so legit
You are eksepshenaaaaaaaal!
0:25-0:26 that second thank you... and the head movement is so accurate lmao
naruto in a nut shell
I promise I’ll do better🥺👉👈
100 Thieves!
Still, a better love story than Twilight
100 thieves hat? Which game fam
Lee and Naruto vibes
Me being introvert but got a friend
So this is why Naruto and One piece have long arcs
You calling out Naruto huh lmao
Thanks man you distracted me from my existential dread with a good laugh
You're not TRAAAAAAASH!! SHUT UP?!!!   DED
if your friends wont hype you up like this who will
And when he was trying to sleep oh my god😂💀
deku
I see that 100 thieves hat
The Take back what u said! Part. Got me😂
Getting mha, one piece, and a little naruto vibes rn
Naruto in a nutshell
Oh my gad!!!🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂
This is 75% of Naruto
First person that popped in my head was deku
The video you talking about is literally below your post
Pokimane: calls herself trash   Her “followers”: 1:32
Ngl, it would make my day if most of my homies were at least a QUARTER this motivational for me
did caleb wait until 3:18 AM just to record his phone??  dedication
Deku in a nutshell
*You're Not Trash Your Exceptional*     I felt that in my heart 👁🌊👄🌊👁
This is so anime lmao
My Hero
This literally happens in every anime
The yelling reminds me of Asta
This literally the entire naruto anime 😂
Your not trash
When he looks at his phone to see the time and I look at mine. And it’s the same time 😳🤯
Deku be like 😂💜
Caleb never disappoints
Imagine if one of these characters ran for president...
2:59 Killua every 10 seconds
Caleb: "bro, why are you screaming!?"  Everyone in Zoom call: "But Is he wrong tho?
This remind me of Asta from black clover
Is it me or does he sound like Asta when he yelling?
Damm Fucking spot on again honestly this is gold shit bro lolz
Completely random fact:  In 1567, the man said to have the longest beard in the world died after he tripped over his beard running away from a fire.
Caleb can you resell the youtooz on your store or something? It won't ship where I live
Oh look it’s Deku from that hero academia show
I watched this at 3:44am
YOU'RE WELCOME! I SUPPORT YOU BECAUSE YOU DESERVE THE SUPPORT. YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE FOR US!! YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAL!
This should’ve been titled “What’s it like to be Dekus Friend” lol
Caleb ur the best😆
If Naruto were a real person.
#oddlyspecific
They juss keys!
Kakashi Hatake. (Naruto)😂
Caleb: Shouldn’t have helped him find the key in the first place
Bro you just made my day
Who do you main?
Bruh the end where he's just like you seeing what I'm seeing
Take bacK WHAT YOU SAAAAAAAAAAAAAID
I spit my porridge over my keyboad waaaah but thanks for the good laugh :D
Weebs be like
When they grit their teeth and hold back they tears with one whole arm you know what's up.
Ok, but that is me verbatim when I’m trying to sleep the day before a test.
oregairu in real life
When I heard him through the wall I lost it 😂😂😂
This reminded me my parents when I tell them a joke
I already laughed in the title 🤣
This is deku my guy
DO MORE 4TH WALL BREAKS
One day I will be first to comment on a youtube video I BELIEVE IN MYSELF I BELIEEEEEEVE!!!!!!! I WILL NEVER GIVE UP AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
2:00  The first thing he does after getting up is wear a hat lol
Nobody :   Deku @ anything :
Anime villain: "Hah, you can't defeat me. I am using my ultimate power that i've trained myself over many years... This immense power is beyond your understanding, to demonstrate im gonna punch you with my right hand that have been imbued by the power of darkness. Behold the mighty power of the dark lor..."  American hero: "Hey, is that the bad guy?" (Shoots gun)
Idk if this is Ask Ketchum, Yugi Moto, or Young Naruto.
Bruh I wish he continued to hide his eyes like in 0:44 .
If you are looking for a relatable anime comment, you have come to the wrong place. However, if you looking for a great muffin recipe...   Ingredients  2 medium eggs  125ml vegetable oil  250ml semi-skimmed milk  250g golden caster sugar  400g self-raising flour (or same quantity plain flour and 3 tsp baking powder)  1 tsp salt  100g chocolate chips or dried fruit such as sultanas or dried cherries (optional)  Method  STEP 1  Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line 2 muffin trays with paper muffin cases. In a large bowl beat 2 medium eggs lightly with a handheld electric mixer for 1 min.  STEP 2  Add 125ml vegetable oil and 250ml semi-skimmed milk and beat until just combined then add 250g golden caster sugar and whisk until you have a smooth batter.  STEP 3  Sift in 400g self-raising flour and 1 tsp salt (or 400g plain flour and 3 tsp baking powder if using) then mix until just smooth. Be careful not to over-mix the batter as this will make the muffins tough.  STEP 4  Stir in 100g chocolate chips or dried fruit if using.  STEP 5  Fill muffin cases two-thirds full and bake for 20-25 mins, until risen, firm to the touch and a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean. If the trays will not fit on 1 shelf, swap the shelves around after 15 mins of cooking.  STEP 6  Leave the muffins in the tin to cool for a few mins and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
1:02 where did u get that fox pillow i want one ☺
This is the reason why Sasuke leave the Village
I feel like this happens way too many times in My Hero Acadamia 😂
So basically how every supporting character in an anime?
Friend: hey mayn you want a drink from the shop? Main character: I WILL HONOUR YOUR SACRIFICE. I will avenge you.
Video title: When positivity aggravates you. LOL
He's a cool man
When the pep talk doesn’t even follow from one point to the next, so u check the subs and it’s on the same non sequitur nonsense
The way he covers his eyes gets me.
No one:   Jonathan jeostar:
Ayo... this lowkey one of his best skits 😂😂😂
Props
i-i-its cool, it keys
Thank you for doing this, it is so cring man
*Coughs* Naruto be like:
Hmmm interesting
I hope most anime studios will watch this and think twice before creating such characters.😂😂
I've never seen Caleb look straight into the camera lmaoaoao
2:22 This look man😂😂
Stg, I did not think that was your socks at first. Shit legit took me outta the video 🤣
oh shit Caleb is a 100 thieves supporter?
When Caleb looked at the camera I died🤣
Looks like Narutos side characters🤣
Friend give motivational speech.  Caleb: SHUT UP!!!
Most of the times when I watch anime, such instances were enough to make me to dismiss to watch the anime. But definitely not this video!
*THANK YOU*  *THANK YOU* 😂 *TAKE IT BACK*  *TAKE IT BACK* 🤣
It's always these side characters bruh😭
Do y'all ever just be watching this dude and then realize... Its tHe SaMe PeRsOn 👁👁👄👁👁    Okay but fr, do y'all even remember the first Caleb vid you watched years back? Like how did we even materialize in this this dude's subscription 😂
I want that foxes
Power of friendship
This is soo good
I love how caleb screams out of annoyance
“YOU’RE NOT TRASH! YOU’RE EXCEPTIONALLLL!!!! YOU’RE EXCEPTIONAL!!!!!!!”  “AHHHHHHH!!!!”
Naruto and Sasuke be like
Why there is not a single video on YouTube with zero dislike
😂😂😂fr
Bro Caleb is so done he had to break that  4th wall
Take back what you saaaaaaaiiiiddd
This is Genos from One Punch Man😂😂😂
Caleb never fails at making me laugh
When you know exactly what characters he talking about 2:23 That face says it all.
I would love to have this toy, but I live in Brazil.
2:02 it's the same time here
When he opens up his phone and you realize your awake and watching this video at the exact time and date.
cough cough naruto cough hinata cough goku  cough and shonen main character except Eren cough.
Second
Dude, I freaking loved this shit!!! <3 This was awesome!!
Jesus christ the acting and delivery of this anime trope. Stop being this good.
Especially the clinch fist and the close up view when they’re wiping the tears away 😂
This is like Naruto using talk no jutsu
I got deku vibes from this
*Insert You Say Run from My Hero Academia here *
Is this deku
That's who I want to be.  *THE HYPE MAN!*
this is actually a big reason some people don't watch anime i reckon hahahaha
Naruto, one piece basically every Shonen
Who else thinks he's been watching MHA???
lee and might guy
Facts anime characters be making up weird speeches all the time everytime they do that I just say for f***** sake let it go and when they start crying I just say you're gay get the  f*** out of my side and i just stop watching the anime.this gives me some Hunter x Hunter anxieties  PS: I don't discriminate That one Guy: equality Me: if you're gay you're gay it's 2020 we don't care how gay you are
The camera angles are on point
Cool figure... I wanna buy but in my country, that's too expensive for a student... Huhuhu
why are you uploading NARUTO's episode??
The man just wants to play some melee
Fucking Deku
not realistic...  forgot the sadish motivational music and 14 flashbacks to that one moment, when his friend picked up a pen for him or smth
Bro white shirt guy is the side character that dies oh no oh go
Daily reminder hes talking to himself.
alternative title: deku just pisses me off
the cring
Fuck this is amazing
The way he had his dead down....accurate 🤣🤣
When you realise he calls himself a good friend and is giving himself a speech.
I love ur work man
Another great vid man keep it up bro
Did Caleb change the date and time on his phone when filming this? Cause depending on his time zone this video might have been uploaded before or just slightly after that 3:18 Sat Oct3 time.
You missed a "you got mustard on your cheek" skit
What a simp
Why did this give me mob psycho dub vibe
TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAAAAAAAAID
I become this friend when I’m drunk 🥴
I'm in this video and I don't like it. This is what I get for watching anime since 2004
Its just a chill fight scene and then *bam* talk no jutsu
Sending this to Deku
Bro he love you
U r gonna turn into an anime character
Naruto praising Sasuke despite his mediocre attitude.
100T
hahaha this is just like the voice inside my head.
This is all might and deku
pov: you're dekus roomate
Lol
THE FUNNIEST VIDEO YOU'VE EVER POSTED💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Tbh I stopped watching other YouTubers but not u
Why he put his hat on when he woke up 😭😭
Love how when he starts, his friend's face says this happened before.
Jesus love you yo
my mom
🤣🤣🤣 (dead) Caleb city was an imposter
Saying anything in japanese makes it sound motivational
Kazuya from rent a girlfriend 😂😂
Ok, maybe the 1st time is believable because he would be like  “Im so grateful i know you man” and all that
This the most accurate thing ever
Your videos are amazing
All I get from this video is flashbacks of Deku
"You never give up"  Naruto: 👀
THANK YOU!!!!!!
We are all thinking deku
1:00 I bet $100 he was playing 2K.
100 thieves Caleb?
YARGHHHHHAGHHH
Where is the subs...i want my subs dude.Just imagine a pizza without the olives on😢
Thaaank youuuu I promise I'll do better!!!😂😂😂
Why is this so true 😂
Iroh from avatar
I can’t stop laughing 😂😭  The acting is too good, thank you     ...THANK YOU!!!
I like how they behave if is the first time it happened
I cant believe Caleb made me relate to him while also feel embarrassed by him.
This is farby the most annoying video Caleb has made.
Should have had uplifting music playing in the background out of nowhere as the “MC” started talking and the “friend” should have been like *where’s this damn music coming from?!*
Brought out the Gamecube controller 🤣🤣
Man I feel this way when watching Oregairu
All this video is just Naruto and My hero academia.
This is Ussop in One piece 😂😂
HE EVEN COVERED HIS EYES LIKE THEY DO LMAOOOO
2:22 🎶Day after day seems like I push against the clouds🎶
for anyone everyone who disliked this video,       You're not traaaaaaassssssh! you're exceptional.
0:26 I don't know why, but this is particually funny to me.
i see that 100 thieves cap 👀👀
He's been watching too much shounen😂🤣
Optimus Prime at the end of every Transformers movie
This is... Incredibly funny.
Sakura:
Why tf is this so true tho
Then we proceed to a dedicated episode for backstory
“Alright that’s all I got gone”
I can't breatheee 😂😂😂 "I'lL mAkE mY fAmIlY pRoUd!!"
lmfao
The power of friendship much
WAIT NO ONE GOT FOLDED LIKE OMLETE

What you thought would happen if you mixed random things together as a kid Video suggestion
Mannn shut up I'm on the GAAAAME
I’m getting real naruto vibes from you.
Bought one already thanks it looks super dope and I will love it and take care of it forever :3
I’m literally crying laughing😂😂😂
This man just told himself to shut up.
Lol I feel like I'm watching an anime 😂
lmao that's me
Hahahahahahaha!!
This will make you lose friends lol!!! For the ppl giving the speech!!!
Am I the only person who cringes when they do a emotional speech?
This is the literal meaning of "Chaotic Good"
That's definitely Deku😂😂
How much time was he standing there?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
I swear this is just Deku
from *"YoU aRe A gOod FriEnD"* to *"i'Ll mAke My FamILy ProUd"*
Naruto when his friend tries to kill him:
I can only imagine what the neighbours might’ve been thinking when he was screaming
I'm so glad I stayed up
*Deku and Kacchan in a drama*
Ash Ketchum/Luffy Crying under the hat visor vibes
this video is my life. I support my people and ride for them to the death. my loyalty is unmatched and my inspiration is top tier. THANK YOU!
Its mha all over again
100T Caleb????
We have a professional anime voice actor right here
This is so accurate

“And you...you’re such a good friend!”  ~CalebCity
Caleb even got the hat to cover his eyes! 👌
Naruto in a nutshell
I wish anime shit is real
Why did I stop watching anime, again?        Oh right
XD
The 100 thieves cap just made it even more realistic
LOL deku be like
people put their keys in a drawer?
GOLD!!
The way he closes his eyes when he screams really emphasises the anime
Everytime i think caleb is out of ideas, Everytime i am wrong, everytime i laugh my ass off, everytime the video is perfect. EVERYTIIIIME!!!!! YOU ARE THE FUNNIEST GUY I KNOW! YOU HAVE NO MISTAKES! YOU ARE THE BEST!!!!!!!
I be wanting to like your videos twice fr.

SHUT UP SASUKE
The spitting, the look in the eyes Never knew that anime could be replicated so well
Naruto vibes
This is how me and my cuz are cause we lose hella shit. I mean the finding shit part games we aight
I hate characters like this 😂😂😂😂
Me and my mom whenever she buys me a pizza/loans me money
One of the things that I don’t like about anime perfectly displayed
Become a motavational speaker please
Go to sleep bro
Shounen shit animes in nutshell
Every video this dude makes always makes me laugh😂😂 there's very few YouTubers that can make me laugh every single video
I just woke up my roommate  Thanks
Lmao that sleeping one has me crying rn😂😭
Everytime I subscribe to someone I feel like they slowly become unfunny... I used to die to celebrity, longbeachgriffy and mbbants. I still laugh but not as hard
this is facts
So is it confirmed caleb is a member of 100 thieves?
Lmao👌👌
Bro quarantine got erryone schedule like FUGG IT
Bro....that second THANK YOU....got me off gaurd so bad lmao😂😂😂
No one seeing that this is literally one piece.
How is this SO CRINGY BUT NOT CRINGY at the same time😂😂😂😂
I want to be this friend, just in a more tasteful manner
this is literally two minutes of deku from mha
He uploaded it at 3 am est. and 145k people have watched it by 5:30
Bro I found your videos a couple of weeka ago and I just wanted to say thanks for all the effort you put into them. Some of the funniest stuff I've seen 😂❤️
Haikyu!!
😂😂😂😂🤧🤧 ngL I'm in real life tears
i understand why there's villains now
That 100T cap pointing to something?
He does the whole anime looking down where you can’t see their eyes and they start crying HILARIOUS
dude if theres ever a role for a character who is always concerned please go for it. Theres an oscar in the end of that line akjdjsjdjsjdjsj some comedy award at least
I was feeling sad recently and damn this video rlly helped cheer me up.
lmao this is Midoriya
The "THANK YOU!" apology shouts are both deadass accurate and taking me the fuck out 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"I can do this I'll make my family proud"😂😂😂😂😂
The title of this video is "Goku's speech before he gets a new form"
He’s definitely talkin about... Deku.. Ash Ketchum.. Naruto... Rock Lee.. Then like 5 other My Hero academia characters mostly😂    Inspiration for my YouTube n content too bruh thank u🙏🏿
This is so painful yet so funny.
Im dying 😂😂
Alternative title: If deku was your roomie
If this is not my hero academia I don't know what is
That moment he stares into your soul by looking into the camera....
You know they gonna start crying over a speech when you can't see their eyes
boku no hero in a nutshell
The real key was the friends we made along the way
midoriya say wha
Bruh and then when the villain attacks, the main character defeats him once, and the supportive character realizes that to become stronger, he has to beat the strongest. So he leaves the main character to join the bad guy XD
It’s the yelling at the back of a couch at 3 am for me
ahahhahahaha this is classic
Is this naruto in a nutshell?
Everyone from Re:zero telling Suburu, then he cries lol
Naruto at literally everything 🤦🏾‍♀️
Lol. This would be so cringe in real life 😅
Seeing this at 4:30 am saying you posted 2 hours ago
Lost episode of My Hero Academia found after who gives a damn.
these videos need you to be creative,cuz you made so many different stories without repeating.👍adorable
All you needed was a single glistening tear and it would be 100 out of 10. Still absolutely hilarious xD
Friend: gets heavily wounded and falls to the ground MC: "Don't give up! You can do this! You are exceptional. I believe in you" Friend: "Bro, shut up and help me!" MC: "Nu"
Bruh the camera transitions, acting, crying is too accurate I can't...
Really gave the second hand embarrassment experience you get while watching those
Am a the only one who gets more depressed when someone complements me or talk to me inspirationally??
لقد علقت كلبي في مؤخرتي والآن لن يتوقف عن النباح ، يرجى تشفير هذه الرسالة وإرسال المساعدة
You can't just post full episodes of Naruto like that.
THIS GUY ALWAYS MAKE ME LAUGH NO CAP
You killed this its too funny 😂
Shounen
Any kids crying rn?
If only he added tears 😂😂😂
The screams before sleeping had me dying.
Cool
1:00 me tryna love myself vs me tryna hate myself
Lol caleb was so over it 😆
Re:zero in a nutshell
Another amazing skit. When you looked in the camera, I felt the pain lol
talk no jutsu
I though I was watching my hero academia for a second there.
I know some characters that act like this
Bro this is so true
The 2nd part reminds me so much of one punch man🤣🤣
Dissapointed he didn't turn the thank you in the end into a speech
His neighbours wondering wether to call the cops or the national help service
It's weird how I didn't realize how weird this was untill you did it irl.
Dude, I wanted this topic for so long!!! This was what I needed.!!! THANKK YOUUU
CALEB CALEB  THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THIS VIDEO  YOUR CONTENT GIVES ME LIFE IT GIVES ME A REASON TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING  THANK YOU CALEB
This sums up naruto almost perfectly lol.
ive been here since 400 subscribers. keep up the great work man
1 is Ida v stain
The expression at the close is 2020.
You can’t say he don’t love his friend
100% Midoriya
I kept a straight face until Caleb cried then Caleb looked at the camera.
Believe it
Where are the exaggerated tears? The snot from nowhere, the tightening of fists that make a sound when you do it. Hahaha. I'm still in stitches from the video
This mans acting is John wick level
Ahhh yes the inspirational Naruto moments.
100 thieves hat 👀👀👀
Now I know why talk no jutsu is so effective
I used to watch these videos without the experience of anime and found them hilarious but now  that I've seen my fair share of anime, the comedy increased 10 fold
Why he open the drawer like that 😂😂
hitler but anime
And over here we have My hero academy season 1-3, 2020, colorized
I need a friend like this
1:39 just ended me when he screamed back at him.
Thanks Obama
We know his trying to sound like deku🤣🤣
When he screamed: "YOU'RE NOT TRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASH", i felt that
Nobody: ......  Naruto:
is this the new bleach trailer?
I felt like I was looking at ash ketchum
TAKE IT BAAA- i really felt that
Deku every 5 seconds lmao
1:12 why this reminds me of Sket Dance so much lol
:))))
Bro it's sad hes as funny anymore
the 100theives cap doe
I think I'm not well... The two characters that you showed are both in me...I do this almost everyday..
I think It's all right to have a friend like that,  as long as he doesn't grow a Sharingan just because I forgot to put out the thrash
Probably how God feels when people pray to him 😂
So accurate  with the whole no eyes appearing because  theres a big ass shadow covering their eyes
This video is straight fax
That's true
It really be like that tho 😂
Me looking at my demons at 4 am like 2:22
Bruh when he said “THANK YOU!’’ 👀, I LOST IT 🤣🤣🤣
Lol
It's all fun and games until the motivational speeches turn into death threats
The 50 people who disliked don't have friends so make those 50 people our friends 👍👍🙂🙂
i feel ashamed that i was up at 5 am to watch this an hour after it was uploaded
I wish there was someone who acted like white shirt caleb in these shows, would make them so much funnier.
Lmaooooo
Isnt this just my hero academia?
I feel attacked as a One Piece fan.
Lmao
Naruto and Deku
*looks at camera*
What about the giveaway winners?
2:22 my man's hit the Jim Halpert on us 💀💀
The build up to “YOURE NOT TRASH” was exceptional
I patiently waited for the gray filter when the music came which never happened ;(
😔
Everytime im with a weeb friend they always have a motivational speech when i talk to them
_Naruto flashbacks to that one swing_
Asta
The pain in his eyes as he looked at the camera looked so real 😂
Deku
Now i know why that sasuke guy did what he did..
Yo this shit so accurate🤣🤣🤣🤣
Brooooo this is literally gonnnn medoriya😂😂😂 “I’ll become better so this won’t happen again” 😭😭😭😭
Deku be like
I just noticed Caleb's camera is smooth asf. He walking in 60 fps lmao
The way he just looks at the camera at the end kills me
Looks like hinata
I know it was accurate because of how annoying it was. I fast forward through these sections like there's no tomorrow
"Take it back" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think they do that so the ep will be longer
this the type of friend you need
The gargled shouting crying is amazing.
My man BARELY made the video and still put it out less than an hour of making it. And it's a banger. Effortless.
true hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Meanwhile in a submarine in the JoJo universe: bro ur underwear is showing (in sign language) YeEeEeEaAaAaHh Manly handshake
When he said "Aaarghhhhhhh"  *I felt that..*
TALK NO JUTSU
Am i the only one who is waiting for a house tour
"Honey, our neighbour is screaming again..."
Naruto LMAOOOO
I’m watching this at 5am and I screamed like a crackhead when he said “SHUTUP”
This was moist critical when he was a college freshman
YouTube getting real comfy with these double ads............................................
Alternate title: When you have an over-loving girlfriend/boyfriend.
https://youtu.be/ZNmNZGMT_ks
0:26 that face says it all
https://youtu.be/ZNmNZGMT_ks
How many animes did he diss in 2 minutes
Deku and Shoto in a nutshell
Bro newest anime = Anime IRL, starring CalebCity  But that 100 thieves hat tho
Izuku midorya in a nutshell
yep banger vid
Bro if this isn’t Rock Lee when he messes up.
Takeee it BACKKKKK
I guarantee you. He is the only person happy with corona. He is so happy he has multiplied himself to share the joy.
You’re not trash, you’re a good person, you’re my friend😭😭😭😭😂
He isn't screaming at night, he is just thinking out loud😂
This is some real healthy self talk tho.
That "Thank YOU!" at 0:25 got me dead
I want that youtooz so badly but I can't justify spending anymore money 😭
This video was uploaded 1 hour ago. Has only 124k views yet 3.7k comments. This shows how great and influential Caleb City is.
"TAKE IT BAAAACK" if this literally ain't Deku just in the latest chapter 💀
This is a sum of all animes except their actionparts
Bro this is my little cousin
Lmaooo lets be honest here. This was an excuse for him to flex his voice acting skills
Ok so I don’t think that everyone don’t noice that it was posted at 2:00 am huhhhhh
the way he stared at the camera lowkey feels like he is staring into my soul
That moment when the gang wars end XD *crips*- "you a good person!" *bloods*- "nah man you is"
Yhe head tilting down with the cap hiding his eyes LMFAO. Gotta zoom into the hands clenching and the teeth LOL
This is basically hinata from haiyku
Where do i find that huge round fox plush xD its so cute
2:07 The scouts after erwin convinced them all to commit suicide against the beast titan
What happens the day after watching anime
This is so real lol
"YOUR NOT TRASH!!!" "SHUT UP!!!!!" I'M WEAK 🤣🤣🤣
Idk why but I rewatched part where he says "you're exceptional" twice it felt like he's saying that to me
*This video is weeb approved*
Bruh
Omfg I love this 😂 The way he keeps his head bowed to cover his eyes 😂😂😂
I love how these spiral out of control real quick lmao
It was a miss opportunity to turn the end card speech into motivational speech
I bet there insnt any way that this can be more accurate
That one person in that one squad who nobody invites but always shows up 5 minutes early
Rock lee
Ah yes the times where characters just look at "you/the screen" into the fourth wall asking you to stop this since your the one making them do this through watching them
When this man was born his first words were a motivational speech to his mom, doctor and the entirety of the hospital's staff.
Every Shounen protagonist:
This motivational friend reminds me of...of my friend. :'(....Dammit.  *sadness and sorrow plays intensely*
What animes is this referencing cuz the ones I watch dont do this shit lol.
This is so true🤣
the way this man looked at the camera tho lmao 2:22
*Motivational* _(moh-tuh-vey-shuhn-al)_ *To scream at one person in order for them to change their mind about an opinion.* _Synonyms_ *Nagging, provoking, backstabbing, mental homicide, verbal violence.* _Brought to you by our sponsor, Youtooz_
Brooooo it's fucking 3:55 where I'm at & this shit got me dead
Deku deadass
It's always a good time when CalebCity uploads!
deku from bnha
This is Asta from Black Clover.
So happy you didn't put in Nakama in any line, it doesn't fit in parodies
Midoriya , this is midoriya
That's the type of ahit kazuya would say just to motivate chiziru
TAKE IT BACKKKKKKKKKKKKK
I like this video before I even fully start to watch it 😎💥
Breaks the fourth wall
"Bro shut up we're in a fight right now"
1:36 in white shirt covid 19  in black shirt America
Real crime is not having your phone on the charger while you sleep.
Why 3a.m!?
One piece in a nutshell
Good stuff!
100 thieves cap nice
This is the majority of anime

rock lee type beat
Nice early upload
1:38
2:15 Math teachers be like: it's 3 what, am? Pm? apples? Coconuts? 3 what?
SHUT UP BRO!

*haikyuu vibes*
He's the same Caleb that supports you WAY to much. The same Caleb that kick Caleb's ass for parking in Caleb's spot
Bro why you still up
The hat with the stance....is familiar...  “HIS HAIR WACK, HIS SHOES WACK, HIS FOOT STANCE WACK, THE WAY HE NEVER SMILES WACK!”
Shit was hilarious, also that statue looks dope
When you’re rethinking your friendship
hahahahahhahahahahah
I cant not breath
Damn now I know why I do this everyday
you forgot the amine motivational music
I got my youtootz ordered!
Obito: *kills naruto's friends* Naruto: *Stop it. Get some help.*
Sometimes motivational's are great, but to hear them consistently can become....yeah. Makes sense.
The best or nothing 🥂🤝
sometimes my friends talk to me like that and i dont know how to act
I should animate this 👀
Dang it if only I wasn't so weak dang it if only i was a little bit stronger if only i wasn't so dang weak DANG IT DAAAANG IiiiiiiiiiiiiTTTTT aaaaaahhhh
Who else heard him touch his keys in his pocket at the beginning??
If you have a friend like that, Keep them       Keep them away.
Nah this be hitting deep😣😢😩
This has to be luffy and his crew
More like my girlfriend
This had me crying laughing in the middle of the night
Covid 19 is  white shirt
Anime really be like that sometimes.

Talk no Jutsu is too powerful.
WHEN HE YELLED BACK I CRIEDDD
U da man bro love yo vids watch every on hahah !

Yo...I can't this dude be having me done..🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When he looked at the camera
I understand why bakugo bully’s deku now
This is not even exaggerated, this is so accurate.
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
URRRRR EXCEPTIONAL
Somebody needs to do this to their friends in public.
Honestly 90% of anime. We learn to deal with it.
Man ... How is this guy so accurate in all his videos???
Ya Geno's and Sairam basically
Naruto talk no justu
This is deku every scene he is in almost.
Dang it he has me beat in both attack&defense even hitting him at 100% is enough i should just...give up....    no i refuse to lose if 100% isn't enough I'll just have to to hit him with something beyond 100%
Why?!!!!! Whhhhhhhhy?!!!!!!!!
I like the way he stands when he is giving the speech lol
My hero academia on low budget
Haha
How is this content FREE
This is literally every episode of Naruto Shippuden. 🤣
This has to be the most dramatic wholesome video caleb has release lol
🤣🤣🤣
I expected caleb to knock him out when he was screaming YOUR EXCEPTIONAL, i think i want his skit to be violent all the time and its bad for my health.
My manager when I'm thinking about quitting.
everybody know this abt deku right?
Your youtooz looks fire as fuck
This is why no one likes deku 😂
the yootooz looks sick
If someone doesn't pick up Caleb for an acting gig I'm gonna be mad 😤
I thought Caleb was gonna turn around from his sleep to show that he was actually screaming from his dreams.
Ahh, the KEYS to everyone heart
*insert Obama rewarding Obama meme*
Imagine disliking this😑🖕🏾
Tim warp
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
*3 hours later* a body has been found bet no suspects to be seen
Man thought he was Iruka sensei with that “you’re exceptional”
Love the video 😄 keep up the good work ☺️ 😁😆
Search it
"I'll be just as good as you someday" I'll be just like you one day  Hmmmm...........
BNHA Season 5 lookin like a banger
Time warp
In anime world we call it "Talk-no-Jutsu" - Trademark Naruto move.
If only right?
25k likes in a fucking hour yo wtf lol
Alt title: Deku.
I feel motivated
the first one is future trunks 😂
Talk no Jutsu
Midoriya: *sweating*
Naruto been real quiet since this video dropped
The not showing eyes is super iconic 🤣
Idk this reminds me of Naruto
When Caleb woke up at 3am hearing the faintest muffling voice. Yeah that's me too.
Me: bumbs toe.  Also:How can I be this stupid? ...  Anime character: You're exceptional.
The staring directly into the camera at the end is what killed me XD
Basically Hairo from Saiki K
Damn, when I saw the title I didn't know you were auditioning for Deku
One of the most funniest youtubers if not the funniest 💀💀
😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂
Caleb looked at me like this 😑 I looked at him like this 😂
Has anyone ever gotten a heart from Caleb? Anyone? I have never seen those  Peace and love to everyone😊❤
0:29 I like how he's trying not to laugh xD
Reminds me of My Hero Academia
It's Deku.
That's the most Rock Lee thing I've seen someone that's not Rock Lee (or Guy) do
I like how he broke the 4th wall at the end🤣🤣
Deku season one
0:20 dude I really appreciate that anime gasp of emotion.
lol
This is so accurate
Who else Is watching this early in the morning 🌄
Sakura everytime she sees Naruto going after Sasuke.
Basically Naruto in 3 mins😂

You been watching Re:Zero season 2 my man
Aye bro @calebcity I didn't realize u went to marine boot camp with Michelle.  I just finished watching the Vid and this popped up

For everyone watching: YOU’RE EXCEPTIONAL‼️‼️
The Seven deadly Sins and Naurto every 3 minutes.
You are so funny
Naruto has entered the chat.
Man think about how good your self esteem will be if you had a friend like this
I for sure had to hit the like button because this is spot on
I'm just surprised how his neighbours cope with him,  They be like, "damn this guy's talking to himself at 3am"
YOU ARE MY FRIEND!!!!!
he dont miss
One peice
This guy shouldn't be doing YouTube. He should be doing movies                                                    Like the damn comment
When youre up in the literal middle of the night but caleb updated

That one side character who follows the main character
Shave g
man i wonder how ur neighbours feel
It’s like the opposite of my conscience
I’m like this with all my friends. I want them to feel the same way anime characters make me feel
R.I.P headphone users at 2:22
Deku x Bakugo live action
Lmfao on point with every anime
Either asta or midoriyia no in-between
If rasengan doesn't work, go for talk no jutsu
Lol 😂😂😂
I SWEAR THIS REMINDS ME OF ASTA FROM BLACK CLOVER
Caleb should get his own Netflix movie
So Caleb... are you getting a Tattoo of a Green Leaf on your Forehead?
PART 2 of this “taking a $hit in the bathroom Motivation speech.” Idk why but It would be wonderful for me.  Everyone agrees right or is it just me?
Hey, I could use someone who would make a speech about how I should be sleeping properly
Y'all are laughing but I would love a friend like this.
And that's why the hero's  friend always joins the villain side
Imagine caleb is your brother
My first thought was "He just finished watching some MHA didnt he" but it couldve been alot of other anime too, i dont like anime like those but i can name a few it couldve been. Fairytail, mha, sometimes Naruto, (cuz its not always over something trivial) and thats all i could think of actually, those are all the shows that have that that ive seen. Ik 7ds has charcters crying every 5 secs, or just all the time, and its really annoying to me tbh, like stop crying, yall are fighting high tier beings in your verse and are going through all this horrible shit, but yet youre all still the type to cry over literally anything bad happening like its not commonplace in your world.
this guy is probably now regretting every single life experience he's ever had, which includes that person.
I was imagining him in anime graphics all this time
This is literally Fairy Tail
Uncle Iroh maybe

"YOUR NOT TRASHHHHHHH" The words you will never hear from your true friends. Lmao  Also real quick I love that outro track.
Plot twist: he's the "friend who's too down for you" video
The good version of the evil anime best friend
Deku in a Nutshell
Never been this early.
Why do u look either high or tired
Why him yelling reminds me of Asuna on Black Clover
i was expecting a generic captain america style speech parody, but you totally nailed it anime protagonist style. from that first choked-up "thank you!" at 0:25, i started laughing out loud because it was so on point and immediately recognizable. and the camera's framing (0:41) focusing on the lower half of your face even when you look up from under your cap is perfect.  keep thriving, caleb. you're so talented and deserve all the success you've worked for. i hope you're proud of yourself for all you've accomplished and shared with us. i'm proud of you.
it gets me everytime he look us right in the camera lenses 😭
This is why I dont like Mha, fairtytail and naruto     U cant watch one ep without hearing nakama or comrade
Alt title: Deku and Kacchan if they were roommates.
Lets appreciate the fact he woke up a 3 am

that "boom" at the end was 👌 no wonder your exceptional
Every weak-willed, crybaby mc ever.
Why are there no knobs on your cabinets? Lol
His Phone says 3:19am on Saturday, October 3... & this video was posted over an hour ago & it’s 4:17am on the same day while I watch this, WTF is going on? lol
Naruto in a nutshell
We wit you bro! "You always there when we need you, aaaaaaah!" Lol
Just waiting for the flood of tears
100 thieves merch though
lol so true
Oh man i can already see the Mha Haters. So fking cringe. Cannot even argue properly. Degenerate Weirdos
I hate how accurate this is. Great work
Oh god, someone finally understands the cringe I had to put up with watching anime.
You’re EXCEPTIONAL!!!!!!!!!!!
It’s like when playing among us and your trying to get them to trust you and you do a speech
im choking
Sometimes when my dog has been in the cage after walking her and given her favorite treat I feel like this is what she say's and I'm like 1:35
Definitely Deku
Pretty much every one piece scene lol
Thank you for making videos
God i hate these characters
Just shoot him already.
Lmao the truth nowadays xD

This what happens when you watch eng dub

THANK YOU  (Cries a river )
100 thieves leaked?!?!?!?!? Are you joining 100 thieves?
This whole video is based off might guy and all might
You can really notice when the anime starts
Some anime shows really be like this :D good vid
Please tell me I wasn't the only moron to stay up until 3 a.m. bingeing all his vids cause I had nun else to do.
Man, that first one was super uncomfortable because it just sounded like me when my self esteem is shit.  Maybe this will get me to stop unnecessarily apologizing for little things now that I hear how ridiculous it sounds.
All I'm hearing: "KAAACHAAAN! KAAACHAAAN! SASUKEEEEE! SASUKEEEE!!!!"
I lowkey want a friend like that
2:23 the stare of disipointment
character development of a yandere character...

This is out of topic but like in some of Caleb's videos he has some black Nike shoes that have a strap can someone tell me what the name of the shoes are?
😂😂💀💀💀💀
This is legit almost every character from Haiykuu💀💀💀
This is so true though (my hero academia)
Every episode of Neon Genesis Evangelion. The kid that's Always afraid, and Never wants to go for the  Kill. Even when the enemy has a very high body count.
I hate encouragement lol
I you the best
YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAAAAALLLL!  AaaaaAAAAHHHHH!!
Every shonen protagonist ever
When you are that drunk at the party
2:00 The blanket covered his head the whole time and he puts his cap on to replace it. Never shows his hair hahaha
This reminds me of my parents turning every conversation into an lecture.
Well I'm watching naruto now  And this is so RELATABLE 😂😂😂
U got me laughing at 3:12 in the morning 😂
Isn't this just Captain America
Deku in the first couple seasons on MHA😂
Like a game at the start of these videos when I'm tryna figure out which character is about to go crazy
I was here since u start making vines bro❤
Armin be like😂
Aaahahahahaha! Anime is dumb.
October 3rd?? Bro how long does it take you to record and edit these
Just imagine what would happen, if this was a hentai character
Yo this is mad hilarious, legit, but this is also how it feels my dude. Like, genuinely, this feels like an internal monologue to some of my friends when I mess up something small or they do something small for me. Anxiety hits hard my dude, keep doing you G
and thats how he became a villain
Sooooo... basically most anime?
Bruh your shit fr always the best cant sotp laughing watching these damn videos
Somebody hook him up with an anime dubbing gig
So Naruto???
Basically every shounen anime
The fourth wall break at the end was phenomenal.
Lmao got me dying
CalebCity rocks! My favorite shots on the internet! Superb composition and editing. Rock & Roll Keep on kicking ass
This made me wanna watch Naruto again lol
We waited 3 minutes I think
Deku be like
damn i was just watching naruto so this hit extra hard
Go to sleep🥱😴
Can u make a video titled"when the anime opening tells u someone's gonna die"
I swear we need an anime called "The daily life of side characters" gag anime or some where it's just about side characters and how they deal with overreacting mcs lol
God doesn’t want anybody in hell because He loves us, but you must understand why we deserve hell and why those who refuse to live under His authority will go there. He gave us the law (Ten Commandments) not to make us righteous, but rather to show us our sin (Romans 3:20). We’re not sinners because we sin, but rather we sin because we’re sinners. Sin is the nature of our flesh that we are born with due to the sin of Adam in the garden. For someone to be justified before God they have to be sinless. We’ve all sinned (Romans 3:23), and the the law demands death for those who sin (Romans 6:23). God is righteous, so He must punish our sin, which is what He did through His Son Jesus Christ on the cross. Jesus is Holy and sinless, yet He received our sin when He died on the cross, so that we can be righteous before God (2 Corinthians 5:21). When He died on the cross, He said “It is finished” (John 19:30), which means He paid the full price for all of your sins (past, present, and future) to be forgiven. He was buried and rose again from the dead. God will forgive anybody who puts their full trust in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. We aren’t saved based on our good deeds, but only by the grace of God (Ephesians 2:8-9). His precious blood that He shed is the only reason why we can be forgiven of our sins (Hebrews 9:22). If you confess that Jesus is Lord and believe that God raised Him from the dead, then you’ll be saved (Romans 10:9). You are born-again with the Spirit of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17), and are not only legally justified before God, but also are accredited His righteous (Romans 4:24). Believers live for Christ now, so get to know Him through His Word. I recommend reading the book of Romans and the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), and watching Pastor Joseph Prince’s online sermons!
ahem Fairy tale, Naruto, Plunderer, Magic Girls, and Bleach ahem   what did you say something?
Side character: Here man...have a cola   MC: *cries in honour*
I feel you're pain bro them anime characters are annoying as hell
Naruto has entered the chat
Bro i need this guy in my house.
1:40 every caleb video ever
This is too funny!
The way he stared into my soul o_o
Believe it?
LMFAOOO
"And you, you're such a good friend!" "Oh, alright thank you-" "THANK YOOUUUUUUUUU" "DAMN"
dude should have did the screaming motivational speach at the end
Absolute BANGER
I lost it @ 0:28 😭😭😭😭
I loved this
That hunnet thieves merch
This is obviously fake, there were no exaggerating tears shooting out from your eyes
“You gone listen to this monologue today!” don’t ever matter what’s going on around them 😂
I aint gonna be able to let him live down them brown socks tho
The way he uses the hat to cover his face is so good
*sasuke exists* Naruto:
Me: Looks when it was posted less than an hour ago. I think I'm early. The view count: 80k Me: Bruh!
I almost couldn't finish the video. The cornyness was overwhelming. If it was longer than 3 min I would've  tapped out
This the earliest I’ve ever been ‼️‼️‼️‼️wassup yall ‼️‼️‼️‼️
Reason y I can't enjoy shounen💔
Lmfaoooooooo
For some reason I hate such characters and this explains why...
*This will get 100K Views tomorrow.*
Awesome. No notification
My Hero Academia summed up in 3 minutes and 8 seconds
This is just Optimus Prime
This definitely that new anime RE: Dark zero
1:15 got me good
Same energy  https://youtu.be/b8niIoZ_ifU
He talk-no-jutsued him
Lmao the way he had his head down He is literally Impersonating Deku Naruto
Bruh
AHAHAHAHA
I just helped u find your keys not save your life
Did you just do this vid today?
this is so cringe I love this
Nobody:  Naruto Uzumaki to literally everyone all the time:
THANK YOUUU! I PROMISE I'LL DO BETTER! I could not stop laughing. That was awesome
His best friend is himself.
1:10 I have a friend EXACTLY like that, i got to watch my toungue when i hang with him
deku literally every two seconds:
He just drank too much coffee.
Plot twist: he is the actual hero who lost all his friends and family and refuse to face reality
The sad music really just pulls it all together
2:22 twitter clip in the making.
T
Nah bruh he made the whole video at 3am he look tired asf and its 4 am where im at and this came out 40 minutes ago
Deku in a nutshell:
this is some classic acting bro
me at my friends when they insult themselves: 1:17
Who else watching this at 3 in the morning?
Caleb mastered talk no jutsu
Thanks caleb, the perfect content i needed at midnight 👍👍
*Damn he's so Exceptional* ‼️
When that overrated pro gamer blames himself for losing the game then cry  His fans be like 1:32
that passionate dude from saik k
He actually look tired bro
100 thieves cap goes crazy
😂
Damn bruh he Doxxed his feet
"Thank you... you've always been there for me! It's only because of you and the friends I have today that I'm who I am now. You give me the strength to carry on when I was in my weakest. I promise you, I'll repay you by becoming hokage and attaining world peace!!!"  -Naruto, to his ramen
The cap-face down is ACCURATE
This is soo true even in DBZ 😂😂
The way his eyes are being hidden by his hat just makes it so much more dramatic
Deku:
Im tired
It was like naruto and sasuke all the time
One word: Rock Lee
You forgot that after each one they get some crazy power boost
Damn 48 min ago 🤩
Reminds me of that special kind of drunk.
this guy deserves atleast 10M suscribers for all the hard work he puts in these videos.
My man copped that 100T cap
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You're a funny man
Hahaha that was good
The way he was looking at the camera in the end just tells that he wants to go back to the real world rather than in the anime world
I’m watching this at 3 am and I can’t sleep 🛌
No one:  Deku every episode:
He's whole life is miserable
Basically deku
Love the 100 thieves merch tho
Me: Sad and lonley CalebCity: *Im about to end this whole mans sadness*
2:05 ngl that light hit me for a split second
That was actually a pretty good "generic" anime (deku type) character
You can say bakugo and deku it's okay
Ah Naruto most powerful jutsu, the talk no jutsu
One piece characters
He uploaded this video at 3am so I can hear a guy scream at 3am in the video and in real life
Suddenly remembered about Mako Mankanshoku from Kill la Kill
One character even though, there are many, One character comes to mind:  Rock Lee
This just made my morning. Thank you man. Much love: stay chilled ❤️
I think Caleb is talking about Deku.
Can't wait for the edgelords to use this as a way to bash on My Hero. 😒
Me: Yo...do you pour the milk before the cereal?  All of the bois: What? No!  That one white friend: gives a speech like the lion king
Yokota
Did 100 Thieves sponsor this video?
Every shounen ever.
I need a friend like this . . .
Really me tho lol 2:15
He needed the sparkles in his eyes 🥺 with the tears rolling down his face 😭 while sticking a thumbs up 👍🏼 and then optimistically smiling big 😁
love the new mha season
"THANNKKKK YOUUUUU!!!!!" 😂😂😂
They both did keys, I guess?
11/10 content
damn
Swear, this is like 49% of Naruto. On my big toe bro
Asta from Black clover 😂
SASUUUUKEEEEE
Iconic
1:50 lol I thought that was homey feet. He just got on some thick ass fuzzy socks
Name me 4 that do this?....
This Alphone from FMA lmao
The way he covers his face with his cap while looking down is too live action-ey
thats my parents exept they make it a 5 hours lecture
Bro how are we even watching anime, it's so stupid?
Lol
Id take Caleb look at the camera as Season 2 of CalebCity.
This is me to my friends. I always try to make everything deep and motivational 😭
Hey calebcity video idea: If licking doorknobs were illegal
This is literally Rock Lee
Honestly we could all use a friend like that lol
This is actually funny
When you have that teammate who is trash but can't be toxic to him because you might be reported for toxicity.  you be like 1:12
2:00 When the time/date in the video matches the actual upload time/date lol #inception
Sorry but the last speech hit home....i have to man....i have to
When he starts crying at the end. It gave me flash backs of when their was no toilet paper in the bathroom.
I watched this at 69k views, I'm cursed
Impeccable
“YOU’RE NOT TRAASHH, YOU’RE EXCEPTIONAL”
Caleb literally just shoot last nights..😂
@naruto
You know it's authentic because he's looking down
There sure are alot of calebcity references in this episode of my hero
D E K U 100% of the time.
The power of BELIEVE is just too strong on anime
The hat over his eyes was a good touch lol
Looking down with the cap obscuring his eyes gives me major Season 1 Ash vibes when he frees Butterfree.
Youtooz link https://youtooz.com/products/calebcity
Who else was dying laughing while he was crying 🤣🤣
When you revive your teammate and he give you a speech
Deku’s bitch ass all day. Also that 100T hat is 👌🏼
them screams aint playing bro
Lmao
full metal alchemist lmao
I cried very emotional 😢💔
yo,to 100 thieves caleb?
The way he closes his eyes while saying "YOU'RE NOT TRAAAAASH" is really anime hahaha
One piece be like....
Thank you I needed this video lmao
Caleb woke up in a sweat at 2 A.M because he forgot to upload this video
True
Well, I waited that one second
Honestly name one show that doesn't give to many motivation speeches  The closest I can think of is dragon ball
Nice 100thieves hat
My Hero Academia kick? I feel it
Did they sell out already? Page not found.
Less goo :P
This Hairo from Saiki K?
Deku in a nutshell
No one: Speedwagon:
I’ve been waiting for this 👌👌👌👌👌
I feel like this is most characters in My Hero Academia
That’s Deku for sure😂
I love this 😂😂
Use me as a, "I bought the figurine and need caleb to sign it" button.
dude sleeps by wearing a cap
Link not working G, Hail up for another jk vid
You're exceptional
I don't always watch his vids the minute it comes out, but when I do eventually man I'm always glad I do😂😂
That "I'm done with this guy" look is just too perfect
Alternate title: 14 year old girls when Billie Eilish does anything
I wanna see what happens when he realize,...he's been talking to himself lol
I wish I had a friend like that one day
When you try to make yourself feel better, but you only find more problems...
Why does this remind me of Deku so much🤣🤣🤣
Hello RDCWorld1. I know u here
Every Disney movie ever.
Deku bakuga
Naruto?? Is that u??   Wait you're Deku nvm
Me every time my friends say they are sad
Naruto
Yo anybody else notice he wearing an 100 thieves hat
3am post? Thank you
😂😂😂😂😂
Qui in deku crying cuz he has no quirk
Midoriya in a nutshell
*SASUGA AINS-SAMA*
Caleb flexin his plush pillows tho. I'm not jealous... 😭
It's even funnier when the anime character starts crying in their motivational speech and the person they're talking to starts crying too - then both of them cry together😂😂
Should've folded him while he was lying on the couch
Man, I felt embarrassed watching this 😂
lmao i swear like momma come home with fries  Me: thank you even after ive been kicking you for 9 months thank you, so respectfull the best mom ever
0:54 "I'll be just as good as you one day"  Yup you can't be anymore accurate than that XD
Caleb chin hairs look like griffy gap.. 😐.. This video is fire 🔥 though ✊👌 #Facts
Ok the one thing we learned.      YOU'RE NOT TRAAAAAAAAAAASH!!!!!!!!
This is most of slice of life/romance anime
Ayy he repping 100 Thieves😂😂😂
We need a Caleb short film. Please.
Instantly thought of Naruto and Rock Lee smh
HHAHAHAHA this was great!!!!
You gonna put the vr vid on the gaming channel?
It's a way to stay focused
"It's just Keys" "THANK YOU, THANK YOU."  I'm dead AF😆☠
Wow. 21 mins and 40K views.
Fam, that friend is like a high level of simp
For a sec he was yelling i can do this with sudden arm movements kinda sus
Your Exceptional!!!!!
Everyone wants to be like you because you're so exceptional Shut up man Dont ever say that YOURE NOT TRAAAASH SHUT UPPPP  The polar opposite of the campaign speech. Like in a parallel universe this is how the debate went. Even got the shut up man in there
1:51 deadass thought this nigga had the crustiest feet ive ever seen but it just socks lmaoo
Caleb my guy when you gonna hit us with that phasmaphobia video
You broke the fourth wall. That’s illegal.
Imagine what his neighbours must think
Why do I play this game I'm trash   Yeah that's relatable
Wtf you can't just post the entirety of Fairy Tail what about copyright issues
Yes this is so accurate! And can we talk about how anime makes everything into a competition no matter how mundane and meaningless the activity? You could probably find an anime about becoming the best literally anything, like even the best vacuum cleaner. I don't mind the these tropes though, they are kind of endearing.
this is a real throwback to the anime villain video
This is Naruto, Asta, and natus
So early, his youtooz link doesn't even work.
P.o.v Calab makes a video at 3:30 am and your watching it
Name of background music at 1:20
Lol I like how none of are sleep rn EVEN Caleb

This is so true though.
First one: When your friend lets you cheat on a test and you get a 100
.....ay get some fucking sleep. Much love. Seriously tho.

It smells like *Naruto* in here
You make the best videos

I need a friend like this... i could use the support...

Clearly Caleb has no idea what's he's talking about since he didn't even say "Dattebayo!".
Lol 😂
This man is forever on point!!
Naruto is typing...
All of them sound like rock lee😂
This is literally rock lee to guy sensei
we up at almost 4 am watching this already
I guess the key was friendship all along
😂😂😂
I swear, every MC to ever exist called out  sometimes it's not even the MC, it's the side character coming in when MC hit that rough spot  y'all exposed lmfaoo 💀
Motivational character: because.. you're my friend! Anime chick: *basically has a heart attack*
Bruh it's like 4 am
Thank you for this nice dose of entertainment Caleb
I fuckin love your vids bruh
3am in the vid, 3am irl... did he plan this?
That hat scene is definitely Luffy with his straw hat covering his face and tears lmaooo
I can't breathe lmao he started ugly crying in his sleep and I can't 😂😂😂
I believe YOU CAN DO IT-  me: no I don't think I will :'(
This is the motivation I need for my training.
Naruto talk no jujutsu
Caleb with that 100 Thieves Cap ayyyy 100T partnership when :^)
perfect anime summarization      - nuff said
I’d go crazy talking to myself for that long
*sniff* *sniff* naruto
It hurts when someone praises you like a god when you help him and that person will bring you down to hell when you don't.
Im not going to lie, i would need this friend.
THANK YOU FOR UPLOADING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Anyone else saw that this was uploaded at *3* AM?
Anime Guy: YOU ARE THE MESSIAH!  Caleb: I AM NOT THE MESSIAH!
Bro this is soon funny
The anime shot angles cracked me up
Anyone else saw that this was uploaded at *3* AM
1:00 Already playing as Steve?
Anyone else got the vibe of Wax on Wax off, paint the fence, etc etc.
the sleeping part hit my spot.
It’s like one of those I fix all your problems and struggles with my positivity and speech girls, in romance anime. Though they usually aren’t yelling and they cry while smiling.
Noice
This was uploaded half an hour ago and its 1:48 for me in the morning
This is kinda like when you show your parents a joke and it just ends up turning into a lecture
lol
bro this shit is so funny bruh
*I know I'm not first but I'm definitely not last*
Why was this posted at 2 am
This is the entire essence of Naruto in 3 minutes
God damn 3k people are watching this at 3 am that’s whild
Well atless it motivates us to watch anime
Plus ultra, I guess?
The last one on the couch 😂
"SHUT UP! SHUT UUUUPPPPP!"  "TAKE IT BAAAAAA—"  *This sent me* 😂😂💀💀
Nice 100 Theives hat
It's 6 pm over here

This  man lol 😂😅😅😅
Bru this shi hella funny😂😂😂
Coulda just said Naruto be like
On his phone it was 3 and I watched this at 3 too. We on the same time zone
Sometimes I think about Caleb and Griffy swapping the sad songs near the end with each other
Neighbours: "Why do u scream at yourself at 3 in the morning?" Caleb: Oh it's my job
Caleb. It is 345 in the morning, and I'm still up. Thanks for the laughs, homie.
he either talking bout ash ketchup or that one kid Midoriya saved from the dude with steroids
Still not as motivational as “I already know that none of them are me.”
Every shounen anime ever.
My hero vibes
The dame lillard look at the camera😂❤️
This video is inspired by Naruto🤣💯
When you start to regret saving that one dude’s life
All Caleb's content is lit
This is Sakura
*YOU ARE EXCEPTIONAL*
Caleb would be a great actor in a live action anime adaption
So y’all tellin me this not Yu-Gi-Oh
This is absolute true and its so hilarious. Your videos always makes me laugh.
I feel obligated to troll my friends like this now
Crying like caleb did(timestamp 2:22) at 3 in the morning do be hitting different tho
Bruh this is naruto dont even @ me
The way he was looking at the camera at the end lmao
Let’s not forget the ones who just shout the power for Friendship and get a power up
Caleb never misses with this shit 😂
POG
Naruto to every enemy possible in the anime
Basically Deku for All Might
Rock Lee anyone??
Hello, fellow Nightgoblins, I see you are all gathered accordingly, we mustn’t let the daywalkers know of our meeting.
Youre such a good youtuber Caleb, THAAANNK YOUUUU
lol naruto vibes
2:05 I love how even for getting out of bed at 3 AM, it's integral to this man's character that he put on his cap
"Anime Characters that turn everything to a Motivational Speech" *Naruto has left the chat
This is like the prequel or sequel to "When your friend is too down for you."
Caleb: I am trash in this ga.. Caleb2: Masaka? That's impossible! You are my friend. You are a good guy Caleb: Tf?
thank you for making me laugh...i needed this
I wonder what the neighbors think about this...
So this is how side character must be feel huh?
he sleeping with socks on cause he know he boutta get serious
This is just the brocklee twitter account as a person
If this ain't Naruto I swear man🤣🤣
THIS IS SENDING ME 💀💀💀 actual tears in my eyes
Nobody:  Deku:
“Don’t say that! You’re not trash! You’re a good person! You’re my friend!”😂😂😂
Believe it.
100 Thieves 🧢 sponsor?
Yo, this new chapter of My Hero is hitting
Yep, the friend will definitely die, because the main character needs character development.
Lmfaoo 🤣🤣🤣
damn i here under 30 min that new
early gang                                                                                                                                    sorry lmao
Eyooooo I'm early
*The fact that he looks down and only shows he's cap and his mouth gives off 100% anime energy lol*
This is the most funniest video I've ever watched in years.
i think meant to put "I act as deku for 3 minutes".
I was having some weird-ass religious beef over a Young Sheldon episode with some atheist and then I see this video. So yeah thanks for the distraction G.
I guess i got a dirty mind cuz that last part made me double take
Don't forget the zooming out and some flashbacks.
im thinking of naruto and one piece
This man made his career talking to himself
give this man an oscar
IDK know about y'all but it be like 3 am(for me) rn and he posted and second god dang it this video has already also 50k views and its frickin 3am. I mean I'm basically nocturnal that's why I'm here but what all y'all weirdos doing that you just happen to be awake. (unless you be in a different time zone)
Faacts tho
2:01 literally how? This was 20 minutes ago and you uploaded 25 minutes ago. How sway
Deku be like
everything can be motivational speech if you have *SPEECH 100* ability and be anime character
This man never misses 😂🤣
Early finally  That means I have a chance in life And I never thought that I would b early  This is a really big opportunity  tHaNk yOU THaNK yOu soo much to myself for checking notifications. THANK YOUUUUU
This is a thing I do, to mess with my friends. lol
1:15 that face was of genuine annoyance, I kid you not
Link in description is broken, here's calebs figure - https://youtooz.com/products/calebcity
Deku be like
Yo he rocking that sick 100 Thieves hat
🤣🤣🤣
I love when he looks back at the camera. It makes me feel like we're friends who give each other *the look* when someone does something
so true
Hi there
Plot twist: motivational friend dies.  Once annoyed character blames himself for not appreciating his friend's support, and is continuously reminded of him by flashbacks he will experience for the rest of his life... or till the end of the series.
Motivational no jutsu
Is there a place call "𝗖𝗮𝗹𝗲𝗽 𝗰𝗶𝘁𝘆"? I want the destination
That "damn" hit different
Nobody:   My sister at 3 am: 2:08
0:50 is Luffy to Shanks.
just wanna say i fucking love ur vids caleb they legit the funniest shit ive ever watched. keep up the amazing work bro
Damn Caleb is also part of the 3am squad!
get you a girl you hypes you up like anime character Caleb
Just a note that your description link is faulty but I got you https://youtooz.com/products/calebcity
TAKE IT BAAAAA-
Actually early for once finally
What's missing is the part where his eyes just remain offscreen constantly.
could be better if someone animated this or used the snapchat anime filter on a budget
Ye those characters are why I don’t watch anime. So much angst
give this man an award lmaooo😂
pin this.
This is Naruto in one 2 minute clip 😂😂😂
Can't decide if the figurine/statue he showed off at the end was awesome or adorable. Maybe both?
* Clenches fists * *Leather sounds*
This is how a good friend supposed to be
Anyone else saw that this was uploaded at *3* AM
This is way too on point
This is my hero academia
alr pack it up deku
Haha haha why is this Izuku Midoriya😭😭😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
Finally SOMEBODY pointed this out! I thought it was weird as hell that I noticed this sometimes with repetitive anime’s but when I tell mah friends they just have a straight face on and say “Nah it’s just you”😑
I CAN DO THIS!!! AHhHHH!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣  💀 ☠ 💀
Midoriya at the beginning of MHA be like:
Man, and to think I was regretting staying up til 4am, thanks caleb!
Anime character breathes     Anime side characters:I prOmIsE u wOnT reGrEt ThIs!!!!
0:47 "dayuummm" 😂😂😂
When you know the rest of the episode is gonna be a flashback.
Why he up so damn late 😂
Excellent as usual
Not an anime character but Zavala does this in every cutscene basically
Whole Naruto series in 3:08 mins
Imma just say I love what he does and how far he's come doing it. 💯♥️
Baku go if he was nice and liked deku 😂
I would be an anime character that makes everything depressing
1:55 sound like rock lee 😂😂
If this ain't eren..
Midoriya in a nutshell
Bro it 3 am
Bro best skits well so is rdc but I love yours to
When he said go home I felt that
This reminds me a lot of The seven deadly sins
Why am I getting Naruto/Sasuke vibes from this video.
1:39 🤣😭 you're exceptional
Calebs like to dislike ratio shows how good he is at what he does
how does his phone say october 3rd 3:19 (2:01) if it was uploaded 25 mins ago on october 3rd 3:13
Danganronpa characters when the murderer is executed:
More like that drunk ass friend that gets in his feels. Thanks. We already know this or we wouldn’t be friends fam 😭💪🏾😂🔥
I cant wait to be shoutin as loud as this when I get my own house
Tanjiro moments on inosuke 🐗
I swear. It's especially retarded when it's in the villains presence, like if I was the villain I'd just kill him then.☠🤦‍♂️😂
Fax

The way he's looking down and hiding his face with the cap is too real lol

Do you mean: **Naruto* ?
You have my respect
Brb gonna go scream YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAL at the homies
One could say the keys unlocked the boundaries of their friendship...
MC: *squashes bug*  Also MC: I would like to thank all of my friends, relatives, and my family for bringing me to this point. I would also like to thank my cat, my dog, and my master for sticking with me until the very end. This is just... This is really just very special to me.
Yo that just reminds me of Deku from 1st season of MHA
Was just watching Re:Zero so this hits extra hard💀💀
This is basically me and my sisters exept my sisters usually match my energy
nice
I felt attacked lmao
-Naruto-   Great vid
The fact that he looks at the floor when he talks killed me lol.
Bro you gotta get some rest you look mad over worked😩
Gave it a like before it started lol 🤷🏾‍♂️
Why does this sound like naruto 😂😂😂
why he gotta put the hat on when he got out the bed
AHHHH!! 😡 🤦🏽‍♂️
If his videos where longer I don't think I would have watched them all
Hahahahahhahahahahha
Sakura when she realizes that she’s dead weight
Caleb you need to act on Netflix 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👑👑A legend 🤣🤣🤣👏🏿👏🏿
E X C E P T I O N A L
You should try braids bro.
My volume was at max when he screamed real loud...
How does he do that Idk
It actually legit be like that sometimes
I legit just saw him post on the community wall
2:05 what side characters hear when the main character narrates every single thought they have
Lol I like it.
0:39 - 0:43 *You've got a friend in me intensifies*
He legit just got up at 3am an said imma make this video
Rock Lee anyone?
i swear this is so annoying
yeah bih
11000th like
So we going to disregard his feet like that
And when the world needed him most he uploaded
HAHAHHAHAHHAHAH
When is he getting a contract? His acting is amazing and feels very real. I sometimes relates to some of his skits and I love that about him. Just need him to reach that higher dimension.
“Your a good friend”  “ you just reduce my rent dude”
At 2:00 the time shows 3:18 on Saturday, October 3. The same day this video is uploaded. This man Caleb really recorded, edited, processed, and uploaded this video all in one day!
Yo caleb, the link doesn't work
Sounds like Izuku Midoriya
I love how @2:00 shows it was just shot edited and uploaded 20 mins ago. Amazing!
Yo, your YouTooz link is broken by the way.
“YOU’RE EXCEPTIONAL!”
Naruto and dragon ball
This is THE MOST IMPRESSIVE like/dislike ratio I've ever seen, 1 dislike to 500 likes, and it's at 11K likes RN
Here before trending, real fans representttttttt
It's like 3 in the morning. Also, how did you know I was watching anime at the time?
This man just disrespected Fairy Tail, Naruto, and Seven Deadly Sins in 2minutes and 33 seconds
Yo, he checked his phone at the same minute the video was uploaded...
That 'TAKE IT BACK' sounded totally from a friend who NEVER exaggerates things and is NOT impressed when you find their keys
Almost every time naruto is fighting someone:
damn. I'm early. Hope every one survived midterms week🤞🏿🙏🏿
I'm dyin f'real LMAO
Anime? This is me in real life....
Caleb motivating himself:
Shout out to naruto
That was a fine motivation
I actually liked forward cap Caleb more than reverse cap Caleb in this one 😅
Aye legit though, those speeches be emotional af and heart warming. They be be the best part of the animé.
1:53 when a character monologues out loud
That last clip must've been recorded right before he uploaded
2:22 When you already put the plates and your parents say that was not worth it, we eating out
at 2:10 It seems like he was doing some "hands on" motivation
Favorite comedic YouTuber. Thanks for the laughs Caleb.
Wtf is up with these guys plugging their channels in every single comment reply
Bro I have to stop watching your videos at night. Suppressing the laughter is TO HARD. I literally feel weak right now...honestly your videos make my day sometimes.
When the main character is giving a spotlight to a side character for character development.
Nice video
DO AN EPISODE --------- OF THE ANIME FLASHBACKS --->>> THAT WOULD BE FUNNY, WE ALL HATE THOSE FLASHBACKS , WITHIN A FLASHBACK OF A FLASHBACK LOLOLOL
The acting on this video was EXCEPTIIONAL
That one neighbor's kid
Hey Calebcity! You've been my idol and I want to become like you some day. Im growing man I have a little over 1k subs. I make small SKITS like you. And was wondering if you could check them out some time man?🥰😇
This giving me Naruto vibes bruhh
Bruh...
Like how he was playing For Honor in the background and then the speech started lol. I wish I got a motivational speech every time I played that game lol. Great content as always.
EVERY SHOUNEN PROTAGONIST EVER
1 word....         N A R U T O
This is literally how genos acts when he sees Saitama fight like 3 demon threat level monsters at the same time 🤣
Him looking down is so true, and the screaming
I get that this is exaggeration, but I've seen roughly 24 different anime and this doesn't happen.
*The power of FRIENDSHIP!!!*
Izuku Midoriya
craig from parks and rec
Friendship: check Advice from a dead mentor: check Excessive yelling and crying: check  yep, this is Naruto
I'm confused I clicked on a calebcity video but now I'm watching attack on titan instead
😂😂😂😂😂
This is sooo true😂😂😂
Friend: is screaming at 3AM Dude: man I gotta wear my cap yo
At this point if caleb made a movie, It would probably be number one in the box office.
What's it like to be his neighbors 😂😂😂
"I can't fall asleep." *Motivational Speech Incoming*
LMAO YO THIS MAN IS AMAZING LOL
YOU GOT THE 100T MERCH IM JELLY HOLY
And days later...😂
😂
Naruto: Am I a joke to you
Stop commenting here , It's just keys
I feel like he is gonna sign with 100Thieves
That’s a very impressive like to dislike ratio
He's great at acting/talking to himself
Rock Lee in a nutshell
*Midoriya has entered the chat*
His neighbors:,
Racist Tomato
Armin be like:
Yo, like if you apart of watching this way too late gang
When you try to order the Caleb You Tooz!!!!  “404, Page Not Found The page you requested does not exist. But the homepage exists.”  WHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYY! ~ in my Caleb voice
Uploading at 12 AM is a mood
Season one and two Deku
YOUR NOT TRASSSH!!! SHUT UP!!! 🤣🤣🤣😂😂
32800th
You have  dark circles under your eyes. You doing good ?
1:43 my friends after 9 shots of tequila and I jokingly say I hate myself
My hero academia
That's is so izuku midoriya😂
Feeling major “Everything reminds anime characters of some tragic event” vibes
You're truly exceptional..
Literally team flash
If Martin Luther king was a main character in anime.
This is basically Deku to every character in MHA😂😂😂
okay but can we appreciate the hat covering the eyes thats so fucking accurate
"its cool, it's keys" "IT'S JUST KEYS"
Caleb is the youtube Will Smith😂
i love how Caleb spends 2 seconds on his thumbnails while other YouTuber's spend hours on their's
Who would dislike a calebcity video?
Its 336am.  I should be sleeping. Instead, I'm crying because I'm laughing so fucking hard 😂😂😂😭😭😭
The first character I think of is naruto
Yo I'm watching this at 3am 😂
Someone sign him to 100 Thieves and have him speak before every esports event lmao
this man just scorched my hero academia
It's not a motivational speech without background songs😂😂
😆😆😆😆
MAN, SHUT UP                  lmaoo
If this ain't Deku every 20 seconds then I don't know who is lol
This is off-topic but I really like those parts in animes where someone talks about something emotional and sad then it just suddenly turns funny because of something/someone interrupting LMAO. (Like that time in Astra Lost In Space where Charce talks about his past then after he finished telling it, the rest of the crew just cries a lot from hearing it then there's that funny sound effect ABDJKSANF). All my tears were wasted for nothing.
Am I the only one who thinks he should do a skit where it's like he's sleeping in his bed and it just gets hot out of no where for no reason and it could be called "when your sleeping and all of sudden you get hot"
From the title I thought of Hairo from Saiki.k
LMFAOOOOO 😭😂😂😂
Deku to bakugo 🤣🤣
Eng dub be like.
Youtooz link broke
Go Slide Him!!!
Eyes covered and everything
Thank you for your videos , your one hilarious dude , also you just help me realize not all videos on YouTube have to be super duper high quality to do well or flashy so thank you !!!
So Naruto?
When he said one second he meant it😂
Are we not gonna speak on how he was wearing brown socks to match with the brown pants when he was laying on the couch?
Yo caleb the link doesn't work for me I really want a youtooz so where should I go?
The way his head is down when giving the speech is so accurate.
The second thank you was so legit, wtf
The reason why Naruto is the worst character in Naruto. Naruto always screaming about hard work, and was born with every advantage.
This is so damn true... This is why watching animes is so hard... So damn cheesy...
Imagine being 17 minutes late
2:07  what is he dreaming like yo why the hell does he screams when dreaming,what is this man dreamin dude
I did something like this once. I felt like a colossal living cringe.
This vids are turning into flexes lol
Caleb, I am so sorry for not being a worthy subscriber. I watched the video 4 minutes after you had uploaded it, and I have the bell notification on. I’m sorry I’m like this, I’m sorry I can’t be as perfect as the other subscribers. I’ll try my best improve, please, I’m so sorry, you’re always there for me, producing content for me, and I can’t even watch the video as soon as it comes out. I’m always late to the video, whether it be a minute late or not even watching the video, I’m sorry I make these mistakes... I’m sorry for being such a pathetic and un loyal subscriber. You don’t deserve me, you’re way better than me, you should get new subscribers, I’m not loyal enough, I’m sorry...
Now make a yandere version
Boom
Anime: idk I never watched it
*Turns the youtooz promo into a motivational speech.*
Obscuring cap during emotional stress on point.
i feel sorry for old people who lives as caleb neighbour. all they want is peace 😂
Hey a 100 Thieves hat, what game?
Can wetalk about how good the Beerus speech was 👀
Looks like Caleb's been watching Re:Zero
Youtooz are bobbleheads without the bobble
Hollywood should hire this guy
that youtooz figure's gonna become one of those items that gets super expensive once the limited stock ran out.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Forgot the fade to black n white when breaking the 4th wall
I need a film outta Caleb, deadass. I want a whole movie.
This is literally GON 😂😂😂
*YOU‘RE EXCEPTIONAL!!!*

New Anime Idea.  CalebCity and the Quest of the Keys
Accurate, sounds like my classmates
Oh hi
Bruh this is just kuboyasu “i used to be a delinquent like you but then i wanted to change so i quit that life and left it behind me its hard being goody two shoes but i will try”
Bro😂😂This video build different
here before 2 million views
The gasps are so accurate, it makes me think I'm watching the most realistic anime.
Suppose that you were sitting down at this table. The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your ‘left’? Or the one on your ‘right’? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is ‘correct’ too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute ‘society’ with the ‘Universe’. The correct answer is that ‘It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.’ …Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there’s no choice but for others to also take the ‘right’ napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is ‘society’… Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‘right or left?’! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who ‘takes the napkin first’ must be someone who is respected by all. It’s not that anyone can fulfill this role… Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the ‘losers’. In the case of this table, the ‘eldest’ or the ‘Master of the party’ will take the napkin first… Because everyone ‘respects’ those individuals.
This goes to everyone, "You're not trash!"
If naruto was here he would be proud
When he starts screaming you throw a lamp at them
Thats Touma every episode bruh
Almost every naruto episode ever lmao One piece early episodes too
Look how much likes he got in 14 minutes
"But, why, why do you keep helping me? And how do you always know??"  "Because you and I have the same keys."
Talk No Jutsu.
Damn it’s 3 over here, he really made it and dropped this
Go slide your boy, Hammie
Liked this shit before it even started playing. Ik my mans Kaleb never misses with this.
30,547th
Random Anime Character: Don't worry, [Insert Japanese Name]. If you push hard enough, you can achieve your goals! Even if you're constipated, if you push hard enough, it'll come out!
The way he just stared at the camera looking at the never ending sins of your soul mind and essence     Have a nice day
Not first
might guy type beat
These clips wanted me to skip forward like the actual thing.       Even the Caleb receiving the speech is annoyed.
If I can't find the keys on my own then HOW CAN I CALL MYSELF A HERO
This is the best video I've ever watched
Kool
Anime turns someones death to motivation.
It may be 3:29 am but now I have reason to keep going
YOURE NOT TRASHHHHHHHHH had me dyinggg
When you mention a girl in front of your mom

Thank you Caleb. Comedy is difficult art, but you got it.
I'm laughing at how hard he seems like a yelling child I'm dying 😂
*Literally naruto 3 minutes*
*When you cant think of anytning original to write.*
You're my nakama.
noti gang.
deku
2:21 that caught me offgaurd breaking 4th walls and shit
Damn I'm early for once
this sums up every anime charecter
When he looked straight into the camera someone must have thought to themselves “Oh shit that I do act like that”
Lowkey need a Caleb cheering me on in everyday life sometimes tbh
2:28 just slip a Nyquil into his drink bro...Imma just say that for a reference to another vid he made, Hope you find it
This should air on Comedy central
3 am best time to do anything

Naruto in a nutshell.

0:19 The zoom, the eyes, the heart beating everything is perfect 😂😂
"man the gas prices are so high today."  "That's not true! You're such a good frien-"
I hate this trope so much. It only took five words for me to seethe in rage.
Naruto if he was real 😆
Low key wish I had someone look up to me as much as anime caleb looks up to normal caleb

Urameshi and Kuwabara
Bruh Caleb and Berlin could lowkey be brothers
I litteraly died when I saw him screaming on the sofa like he's in that deep sh*t lmao
Pog
I guess the key is friendship.
I just ordered your youtooz, caleb 🙌
My lil bro when I win a fortnite match for him
It's like the final battle in an anime and the good guys power through with the power of LOVE and FRIENDSHIP.
Since the days of Vine, bro has not missed with any content he puts out 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
The fact that he uploaded this at the same time his phone had is exceptional
*YOUR NOT TRASHHHH YOUR EXCEPTIONALLLLLLLL*
CalebCity is goat tier
Fairytail in a nutshell.

Bro you already know I got your Youtooz...hell yeah!!!
Watching this at 3:18 AM as well spooked me
I am inspired by this speech of keys
Like 90% shounen
xD I can't bruh!
I hope you do a video on anime characters and food, how they are devouring food instantly and how absurd it is
He really uploaded at 3am and screaming lmao
Any one else thinking Rock Lee!
That was probably the hardest ive laughed in a while bro
3 am is best time to get motivated.
First character I thought of was Midoriya 🤣
naruto is typing.......
Bro relax, you good😂😂😂😂😂😂
Best part at 2:22.
I’ve been watching for a couple years and your quality hasn’t slipped for even a second, and you give us all this great content for free? King shit
A upload at *2:15 am?* Sounds good to me sleep is for the weak! 😂
dude at the end was tryna motivate himself to nut
Forgot the dramatic tears, music and posing
I need "Youre exceptional" as a singled out audio file please thanks
Oh um btw caleb the youtouz link aint working 4 me
😂😂😂😂😂😂facts
Deku be like:
Criminal: _Literally robs the MC_ MC: The reason why you robbed me isn't because your a menace to society... *it's because I'm just not strong enough.* That's also the reason why my parents abandoned me. This is just a sign to get stronger Criminal: No...this is a robbery... *empty your pockets*
1:36 Im dead "TAKE IT BAAAAACK"😂😂😂😂😂
Boss music has started playing
Caleb: *Wakes up and puts his hat on* Me: Wake up..... SLEEPS
Deku's bitchass
This man screaming while on the couch😂😂
Sounded like gohan's speech when he was turning ssj and vegeta's speech wden he says goku is stronger when caleb started
you know its annoying when he looks at the camera
My dad and teachers irl
This is basically DBZ, Naruto, My Hero Academia...eh I could keep going but you get the point.
This post just called me out 😅😅😅
I can't breathe 🤣🤣🤣
This is internet friends in a nut shell
I love the anime videos
I can imagine fairy tale being like this
Basically almost every 13 year old protagonist.
my favorite prt is when that character wonders why their best friend betrays the later, becuase your loud assgotta preach about everything like your in a soul church on sunday
When he screamed at him tho 😂😂😂😂😂😂 oh nah not the sleep speech
peep the 100 thieves hat
Nice Deku impression
It's like 3:25am and I was about to go to sleep but then I got a notification and I was like 😏
BRO YOU MADE A CAREER TALKING TO YOUR SELF THAT IS SO AWESOME I COULD HAVE NEVER DONE THAT
I Seen The Notification While Watching Highlights Of Caleb Playing Among Us 🤣
Man, I’ll never be good as the other commenters. They are so smart in what they say. They are so great at commenting on the video that adds more insight and laughter. I’m stupid and I always have to edit my comment over and over again. DO YOU HERE ME OUT THERE! YOU GUYS ARE EXCEPTIONAL HUMAN BEINGS!
i was just going to go to sleep but caleb posted
Ah damn there’s already almost 2k comments. Must have been late.
This should be some sort of prank or something. Very funny and wholesome.
Fax
Neighbours : is this young fella screaming at himself again?  XD
"I PROMISE!" "Its just keys"
Bruh that's just parents, except it's with a simple joke😂😂
He covered his eyes with a shadow and everything damb

God this is such a crybaby deku thing to do.  God I hate him
2:22 so perplexed he broke the fourth wall
This is naruto     Fax
name an anime that doesn't do these things, i'll wait.
DeeDee: Why are you monologing at 3 in the morning? Caleb: Because I've lost controll of my life.
MC: *breathes Sidekick: THANK YOU FOR BEING AWESOME AND BEING MA FRIEND
Eyo that’s me when I lose shit and my homey finds it
Why do they always look down on the ground
Last time I was this early...                Idk what to say lol
if you see this have a good day 😂😂
MY HERO ACADEMIA !!!!
This guy needs a hug a big hug
1.7k comments in 10 minutes wow.
accurate
I guess Katara is an anime girl.
0:40 Me talking to my dog cuz I have nothing else to do
Alternative title: *Naruto*
Hello there my fellow Caleb
Naruto in a nutshell
i don't think i can survive in a world devoid of caleb's videos anymore.
Another thing anime do a lot is turn things into romantic feelings. I saw an anime do it for cpr. 'Oh no, she kissed me!' 'Why would he save my life if he didn't like me?' Like bro, who would just let someone die right in front of them?
And then everybody in the comments praising and if you say something about how they start preaching every 5 minutes of the episode they’ll throw you out a window
I'm now motivated who's down to bring world peace and hunger
This is literally Luffy.
people when their youtube comment gets 5 likes
Aren't we going to appreciate the part when he's like shocked and makes that sound like anime character's do
People: so what is your motivation?  Regular People: Success, Happiness, Wealth, etc.  Him: my friend helping me find my keys
This is basically us @ Caleb lmao
Did you record the 3am clip right but uploading?
Me in a nutshell
Alternative title: talk no jutsu
Perfectly captured all the tertiary characters' mood waiting for Ichigo and Rukia to finish their dramatic monologue
Random characters: I had an Omlet Main character: An Omlet is the source of life and understanding...
Steven Universe but more anime than it already is....
Woooo
I like how it’s 10 minutes in and there is already like 7 thousand likes
YouTube is getting really comfortable with these double unskippable ads.
🤔 idk what to comment but I’m early... Oh...found it....”I’m just here for the interview.”
Me trying to hang up on my parents.
CalebCity: Anime characters that turn EVERYTHING into a motivational speech Michael Jordan: So I took that personally
Anime character: does something  Reason:FoR My FrIEnd
Can totally see LongBeachGriffy saying "Take back what you saaaaid! You're exceptional! Take it baaack!!" to him.
I got your Youtooz 🥳
That’s actually facts tho😂😂
LMFAOOO 😭😭😭 sounds like Deku
That last one was too funny, Caleb is a trip lmao
Man, I’d be so down to see an anime of Caleb’s life     starring only Caleb of course
Man he sound and actin like Deku in the second one lmaoooo
Mans called out deku and naruto in one video
You’re EXCEPTIONALLLLLLL!!!!!!!
Anime characters would make great inspirational speakers
the figure link is broken... but OUR BOND IS BEYOND SEVERED! YOU NEVER MISS WITH A SKIT-- I MEAN YOU NEVER MISS! *THANK YOU* FOR YOUR CONSISTENCY!
So basically just Deku
pls make a setup tour or something
Brah just slideeee him.
His eyes being obscured is a nice touch
Facts yo
My mother died  "Dont worry il take good care of you as a mother*swaps gender*"
2:25 yo. This really is a big bruh when caleb looks at the camera.
I feel like Caleb's skits are like sitcom episodes
"You can! You have to! You are not trash" sir, you just motivated me more than my teachers in the past decade
Rock Lee be like lol 😂
Oh my god I'm dying
Same vibes as the guy that threatened to kill a dude that parked in the wrong spot.
POV you're motivating yourself.
Been waiting for someone to to make this
Caleb you either need to grow the beard or don’t. IF YOU PUT YOUR MIND TO IT, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE! YOU JUST HAVE TO BELIEVE
This is one of the reasons why I find it hard to watch anime.
Yo, Caleb high key talking himself up in this skit tho lmao
I was sleeping and heard a ding it was like Christmas morning when I seen caleb upload
YOUR EXCEPTIONAL TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAIDDDDDDDD
I was actually planning on going to bed until I got a notification from caleb sorry sleeping schedule I'll watch this video first and then I'll go to sleep it's simple as that
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Only thing that would have made this better is if he referred to him as his "Nakama."
"Why the heck the neighbor is screaming at the top of his lungs?" "Oh, it's just Caleb making another video about anime."
“Your Friends That Are Too Down For You”    Ifykykyk
When he stopped to stare at us, I was rolling! Damn that was funny.
How is it 3am this was uploaded 5 minutes ago and it’s 2am here where do you live
Did you just make this video a couple minutes ago?
Naruto when he xant beat the enemy:
Naruto, Midoriya, & Asta 😂😂
THANK YOU  THANK YOU!!!                for uploading this video. it made my day!
Joseph Joestar explaining why he respected AC/DC:
just tell me you laughed during makin this dont'ya 😂🤣
To the non anime fans: These sound a lot less awkward in Japanese I swear XD
So that's how it's like to be a girl and having to deal with nice guys.
2:23 Helicopter  Hat!
This is Legit how he feels
ITS JUST KEYS!!!!
2 am. VIDEO!
FIRST
F1"Ow, fuck" F2"What?" F1"My hair got stuck in my glasses for a sec, I'm fine" F2 *I felt the same way when my clan was murdered, but fear not for life has a way of-*
"YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAL!" "ITS JUST A GAME!" "YOU'RE NOT TRAAAAASH!" "SHUT UUUUP!"   Caleb City 2020
They do be looking down with their fists clenched and their eyes closed, while shivering 🤧
This comment isn't what you expected. Don't look down         Your'e still looking             Stop        Plz stop         How are you still scrolling                     You're still scrolling               Nevermind.Here's your reward🍺
YOU’RE EXCEPTIONAL!!!!!!
1:51 I thought this was this man ashy ass feet I was like you gotta have some real confidence
Caleb:*figure exists* Me:He,Caleb;he's the figure!!
-"Everyone wants to be like you because you because you're so exceptional so no, you're not trash. Don't ever say that. YOU'RE NOT TRAAAAAAAAAAAAASH"😂😂😂😂
When Midoriya and Naruto's personality hits you rockbottom
Talk-no-jutsu is and always will be undefeated.
Caleb to himself: Caleb you truly are a reliable person
Damn the youtoo site crashed... that shit looked 🔥!! But good video Caleb
My dude said that he would upload on the 2nd he released this at 12:14 Am he lied.   I know that for his time it’s probably before 12 Am
Y is u uploading at 3am. I’m not mad, just curious
Me: *KETSU WO TABERU* Minor character: NANI!?!!!!
You're hilarious but I also think you could get into serious acting. You have the range for it!
The last part sound like me when my parents check my grades
I always cringe at the motivational speeches in anime. Does anyone feels the same way or is it just me?
The way he breaks the fourth wall just to transfer the thought,  'This is what my life has come to.' 2:21
he can be any character that he want, this is what one man army mean
Black kinda sus.
This dude just don’t miss💀
thats why i be rooting for the bad guy all the time
Please explain how being "first" even though you're not, is an achievement in life.  Like damn, no one cares yo
ngl I hate those cliché characters too
"You're my friend."  *Every Main Character ever.*
*it's just keys*
Lmao... love your videos
5.6 k in 8 mins
This is basically every girl in a harem when the MC passes salt
*fails entrance exam, gf leaves, stubs toe on the corner of the bed*  0:50
imagine if this is what Jesus felt
I saw 2 identical rocks in the desert and it was hilarious
"YOU'RE eXCePtIOnaL!!!" and Keanu Reeves' "You're breathtaking" have a similar meaning yet such different vibes
Im the exact same person when i lose my phone
dang first 1,000                                       sub  to FiestTheBeast
Anime Characters:talk aloud Other Anime Characters:I don't hear a single thing
2:23 How I feel waking up in the morning an hour before my alarm
This is when the villain crashes down on the MC's best friend and starts voicing out their evil monologue about why friends are useless and everyone eventually betrays you.
Actually this would be useful in real life
Like the 100 theves hat 5
Looking at you Deku
YOU'RE NOT TRAASSSHHHHHHH
I hate that when he looked on his phone showing 3:19 AM. It was 3:19 where I was and got terrified.
I love the one where he’s talking to himself as he’s trying to sleep. I feel like that’s every anime and I always wonder why know one in the same house can hear them 😂😂
yo sup boi
gon and killua act like this
They really nailed it when he covered his eyes with his hat
The 100 Thieves hat looking clean my brother.
Literally every shonen anime in a nutshell
Naruto and the squad of friendship just passed thru Caleb's soul
Yo you cop the 100 Thieves pack in Rogue Company
Deku be like:
This is literally just all of Naruto.
Armin who
Mans up at 3:00 am posting videos lol
When the dude covered his eyes with his hat, I felt that.
That first turn and blank stare. He knew exactly what was about to happen.

caleb drops this vid naruto: ...
"Anime Characters that turn everything into a Motivational Speech" *Naruto has left the chat*
... The first time I ate Ramen... Tch... It was the day my dad came back from the war. It was the war to end all wars... And when I ordered my spicy pork Ramen my dad told me the story the day he came back and we ordered bowl after bowl. He was in such pain but the one thing that made him get through it was me and him just eating a bowl of Ramen together.  ...thats why you love Ramen?  Yeah.
He loses his shoes look’s down and there on how could I be so foolish
I stayed up all night for this
damn
This shows proof that everyone in quarantine has just been watching Anime.
Kinda weird for him to not have violence or plot twists in his videos 😂
I got to the 3:19 part at 3:19 irl
You- You’re my FRIEND *heals 20 broken bones and stops all his vItAl OrGaNs from bleeding*
Deep down we all wish we had the anime protagonist as a friend no matter how annoying it may be
Yeeeesssssss
Dude it’s 3:18 over here so the time on his phone was dead on kinda scary
This just sum naruto sh*t lol
The covering eyes with cap is so accurate
*Narutos entire series in a nutshell:*
@Asta @Naruto @Luffy @Deku
when Caleb checked his phone it was exactly 3:19AM for me too
*Naruto Shippuden op 2 intensifies*
Its crazy that I saw the 3:18 part at 3:18 lol
Literally the had the same time he did when he looked at his phone lol
"Don't say that! You're not trash!" Well if I'm not trash, am I recycling?
When you mom pre orders the play station 5 for you
NINJA, I WAS SLEEPING AND YOU'RE UPLOADED THIS LOUD ASS VIDEO!
0:43 Naruto after Sasuke tries to kill him for the 100th time
Those motivational speeches are emotional 😭
Great video as always
"you're exceptionAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  also who else thinks this is literally deku
This scene always makes the show 100x more awkward...
I'm so early, but I can't think of a funny comment. Frick!
YAGER
I feel like those get annoying
This man thankful.🙏🏼
I tried to buy your figure and the link goes to a page that doesn't exist
Your acting is just amezing man 👍
when he pulled out the phone it had the same time as mine.
Side characters: *breathe*  MC: its because... you’re my precious ✨friend✨
Just say you're the villain, then he'll stop
Me:Throws the apple in the garbage                                                                                                                            Ants:This is war

Congratulations on the figurine again man. Bills got this mom on this drop. But I'll hope to catch the next one.
When he checked the phone and it said 3:18 so you check your phone and it’s 3:18 👁👄👁
Your YouTooz link is not working
This is 3 minutes of Caleb telling himself that he's a good friend to himself
caleb: *does thing * Caleb: “YOU’RE A LITERAL GOD! ALL HAIL CALEB, HE IS AN ENTITY FROM THE 4TH DIMENSION! PRAISE HIM FOR HE SHALL PASS JUDGEMENT ON US P R A I S E
New gen shonen MC’s 👀😂😂
Literally me to the other person who said "He is not the imposter" in among us.
Life changing
*Side character got mind controlled*  Main character: You are my friend
1:30 bruh the amount of sheer emotion in this speech

The worst thing is that this probably spanned 2 full seconds in real time because motivational speeches are always free action.
Literally all of mha
You can tell this is directed towrds haikyuu
Every Indian dad will give you 36 hour lecture after you make a mistake.
Insert flashbacks

When you realize the time on his phone says 3:18 and I look at my phone and it says 3:18
Ok ima get that
It's Crazy..... It Was 3:19 am When I Watched This Video 😅
Erwin Smith doesn't think it's motivational enough. You need more screaming and body action to the point where you can send soldiers to their death, screaming.
HAJSKCMF THE ACCURACY
2:08 That's me before the exam beginnes

Then the guy in the white T found the inspiration to get up and defeat the villain.
Friendship is power!!!

Nobody: Caleb: YOU'RE NOT TRAAAAAAASH
Yo you will never lose a fight with that type of motivation. The power of friendship never fades
Yeah, someone dial down the philosophical setting

You broke the 4th wall 3 times
First
anyone else think of a certain main character from My Hero Academia......
Ayy mans repping the 100T cap! Respect!!

Naruto to Hinata when she’s fighting neggie. TAKE IT BACK!!!! YOUR NOT TRASH!!!!!! YOUR EXCEPTIONAL!!!!!!
Y’all fr be typing here before y’all watch the vid
Lol 😆 “take back what you said”
This is not a motivational speech more like a cry for help
This is me after a beer too many trying work up the nerve to hit on the bartender
this is why anime is trash
They probably could make a speech about a lollipop
It be the worst when they do this during the middle of a good ass fight.
Why is people up this early
i wonder what his neighbours were thinking
This reminds me of the door knob vine
Gurren Lagann in a nutshell   “Believe in the Simon who believes in you.”

The “ YOURE EXCEPTINAL”😭 spot on
Who clicks on a Caleb city video and thinks “I’m gonna give this video a dislike” shitty people man😒
*_Thank you for lending me a 1 inch pencil_*
Caleb: post a vid    Me: Yesssssiiirrrrrrrr
Literally Naruto
*YOUR EXCEPTIONAAAAAL* *TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAAAAID*
there's only one dislike and 1k likes
The hat covering his eyes is a small detail but it’s so good
Is that 100 thieves sponsorship? Or just a fan?
Basically Talk no jutsu
1:40 AHHH
When you're trying to make excuses to your mom but she's having none of it. She keeps telling you to stop but you keep screaming.
I also feel motivated
Naruto: talk no jutsu
Plot twist: He’s a motivational speaker.
I like how he isn't even looking at his friend when he was doing the speech
Caleb is the goat🤣🤣🤣
0:24 look at his face. He most be thinking "Oh shit, here we go again."
500 comments a minute
* Natuto speeches in a damn nutshell *

*"YOU'RE EXCEPTIONAL!!!!"*
Hmm
3:15 am and I’m still up
Man Sounds Like Tenya Iida 😂
Caleb's Neighbors: Hello 911 he's yelling to himself again
I'm getting some Naruto vibes in this video 🤣
Was waiting for a new vid for a long time.....
y’all so damn focused on being first please just stfu and watch the video
wholesome but exceptional
ITS JUST KEYSSS
And it's like always one lip flap off and they're always screaming way too loud and the art style doesn't fit what's going on in the anime and the dub is really bad in general
This is facts
Bro how’d you get footage of My Hero Academia season 5

Yo I remember some dude who did something similar to this. Mans literally went on like half a minute tangents everytime someone was trash talkin themselves. It was wholesome but hella annoying after a while
He forgot the excessive yelling and crying when the characters say sorry
YOUR NOT TRASH!!!
dang dis is good
HURRY THINK OF SOMETHING FUNNY.
You're exceptional
But a friend that would remind you how good you are over the smallest things seems nice to have But it would get annoying after a while
Fr thoo
Jiren: Thank you so much for motivating me to find who I really am! You are my best friend! You've always been there for me...
This video is me giving compliments , only that i say the same things but with different words.

At this point caleb IS an anime
Deku:
This man uploaded a video at 3:13 for real "you are exceptionaaaal".
Always making bangers imagine how goof a 20 minute short film would be from this dude. Top tier YouTuber

0:28 This man even did the angle that blocks the characters' eyes. What a legend.
Naruto be like:
>100 Thieves hat  Ah yes, someone else who enjoys being hurt.
Nobody: Midoriya:
_...Also when the character make the surprise grunt when reacting to the person’s emotional speech._
Caleb marries his own cloned character*
This character is Naruto
