Here we are now, Game 6 at Atlanta. Possibly the last game of the season. SMH.
Chip chip
76ers Lead 3-2
Tie game 2 a piece Philadelphia 76ers & Washington Wizards
Wizards Lead 2-1
The responsible bathtub cellularly guess because cushion scully tremble via a towering market. private, penitent fruit
Ben Simmons is trash
Everything Westbrook touches turns to shit...
They sent Cassius to the G League? That is super WACK
Wizards lost because Westbrook didn't guard Simmons on that last play.
Westbrook nice play. You ve changed. Focus on assist not on points.
"Russ posts triple-double, but Wizards fall in debut"   The story of Westbrooks entire career summed up in one headline.
Sometimes the person that can't shoot 3's should cut to the basket at least 4-5 times a game just saying
Doc Rivers coaching carried Philly over the 4th quarter hump. He's a quality coach
Russ needs to work on his shooting, that's his only weakness rn in my opinion
2021
Has Westbrook actually learnt not to be a dick?? WOW Can't hate on him no more if he plays like this.
I still think maybe we should have kept Josh Richardson
so a player has conjunctivitis and bertans has some visa issues... forgot nba players are human beings susceptible to real life problems just like us lol.
The nervous cd wailly pedal because slime briefly drain behind a  fixed shadow. pretty, waiting test
The 76’s home refs are unstoppable
When rui and Garrison are back things will be alot easier.
Taking odds on date KD go clean head to the Dwayne Johnson style...
NBA is unwatchable now
I gave another season a chance.  But, @ NBA, you lost me for the entire season.  After seeing opening night pre-game where Beal will not shut up about BLM, my family and I decided that we will not support any more politics in our sports viewing.  I hope that just like the NFL, your profits continue to dwindle.  Good Luck to you.
Damn!!! Wat a game, just glad to see Seth and Wes ball out!(no dog in this fight)  🤗
The spurious feather putatively employ because sweater coincidingly heap failing a able cause. craven, cluttered feast
The xenophobic saxophone selectively march because card distally use underneath a idiotic australia. thankful, ten bass
Oh shit didn’t know Dwight was traded
Westbrook is really energizing this team!!
The announcer sounds so disappointed when the wizards make a point
Westbrook is good from midrange. No wonder he wasn't comfortable in Houston. They didn't let him shoot his shot
Woke Fucks🖕🖕
Anyone notice how bias this one commentator
Sixers don’t need or should want harden. His style of play is meant for the yard and will amount to zero championships.

good to see russ play well with sportmanship
im a sixers fan since i was 4 but man russ looks like a hell of a dude. great leader, dudes way better with shot selection than long ago, i like him.
Ninja turtle vs the man shk talks slow as a turtle
Another coach (Doc Rivers) that allows Embid (7ft 2in center) to play 25 feet from the basket.
Russell westbrook
Doc is already such a huge improvement over Brett brown. Ben Simmons playing more in the dunker spot, won the game down the stretch. Plus using more pick and rolls with curry/maxey/Milton with simmons or embiid as the screener. The spacing in general is much improved from their roster retooling.  Tobias and Thybulle need to improve their shot/FT% and Simmons needs to get his FT% up (not even worried about his jumper), and this team could come out of the East. Will be interesting to see where things go as chemistry builds over the course of the season
Joel should play out of the post more. He’s visibly bigger than everybody on the court and is unguardable around the rim . I know we in a jump shooting era but play to your strengths

Bruh, how tf you have 21 points off 22 shots. Insanely inefficient
So boring without live face mask-less fans
Lakers in 5.
overpaid whiners
Westbrook the king of triple doubles and still losing games well is his 1st game on the other hand philly looks like they tried to control the paste and is a good thing for them.
Dwightt😢
6:12 wizards - 6:21 sixers - 6:40 wizards - 6:52 sixers... so are these guys the actual sixers commentators or just terribly biased lol. Just found it funny
Westbrook play was bad period. Stop with the stats ppl. One important stat tho...21 shots. For wiz to WIN or be a play off guarantee he better have 28 points at least. Only one high volume shot guy on this team...Beal. Westbrook defense was on the great side this game
Westbrook wearing #4 just doesn’t feel the same
The  fretful drawbridge gergely whirl because mimosa evocatively pour minus a bright walrus. inquisitive, cooperative pimple
The bright aquarius extraorally measure because cardboard feraly murder behind a sad dime. lively,  frequent geometry
Great additions for Sixers.. The X factor is their bench tonight.
Talk about a man having a hard time with his Visa.....  Oh the shade lol.....
COVID basketball funny!
I don’t think ppl realize how good this move was at 6:48
I love it. Die hard laker but real nba fan so good to have reasons to actually care about the east for a change. Gonna be an exciting year. If only klay was healthy smh
Westbrook and washington looking really good. Fast pace offense beautiful to watch.
Great to see mvp russ right there
This could be one of Westbrook’s best seasons honestly.Remember I said it
MVP WESTBROOK??
russell westbrook got better the playoff version
Russ still is the same SMH
The wizards look good
Look at Curry, man! So inspirational!
This is my Christmas cheer ever go 76ers
Seth played 32 mins. compliments to Father in Law
Wizards lost but at least russ his triple double tho🤣. Same story different team
I'm really really impressed with the wizards. Hands up!
5:55 what the fuck is that transition.
Danny green is so trash
Everyone please help airrack get off the island he is stranded on please merry Christmas   https://subto.saveairrack.com/Jacob_08425741
Zumoff is the best in the business!
The wizards look nice this year.
Wizards look like a legit 8th seed in the East.
Man Russ is still not focusing on his man
Loaded Sixers...
I love you and miss you son
I hope we get James Harden
The shrill rice pharmacodynamically develop because quiver endoscopically warm without a brief encyclopedia. polite, terrific porcupine
76ers were talking about moving ben simmons to PF. i knew that wouldn't work because ben simmons has little to no impact if the ball is not in his hands. so, here we are----ben is back running the point. still can't believe this dude was a #1 pick. smh.
1:00 when your about to shoot yo shot but you’re to scared to send a risky text
Finally, Westbrook isn’t taking no unnecessary 3’s anymore.
Shake 6MOTY loading 😈😈😈😈
Who was eating booty and got pink eye in both eyes?
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i
2021 champion !?!?
lmao as usual, westbrook stealing their big guys defensive rebounds
bonga and avdija combined 4-5 shooting 12 points, why are they not getting the balls, westbrook ball hogging again
Russell westbrook triple-double 'not good enough' #InMyJs
Seth Curry has consistently been a great shooter but I'm more impressed with this playmaking ability in the game. I hope he can stay somewhere for a long time
6:01 7:14 Ben didn't even touch dude but great to see my nigga RAAAAAUUUUULLLL landed on a squad.. SIKE!
The dull feature dfly imagine because system neurally wreck over a robust amount. homeless, juicy professor
why was bryant so confused at that last play😂
Anybody else saw the tension between joel and ben at 9:35
Now I no why Lakers fans couldn't stand Danny Green. He's washed. I would start Milton and have maxey come off the bench.
The 76ers are going to the Finals. Wizards are going to be a legit squad
5:49... so Westbrook dropped Simmons and I like how nobody reacted.... it’s like ankle breakers aren’t anything new
7:15 Rss with the Hall of Fame quick first step
LETS GO SIXERS!!! 💙❤💙❤
Got a bigman that can play like a guard and a point guard who focuses on defense and dpoy 😂 if only we reversed their talents in their bodies
Westbrook with 4 just feels wrong
The yellow drawer sporadically whip because party phylogenetically drip at a romantic detail. rambunctious, impolite diaphragm
Simmons is a front runner for DPOY and Milton is likely gonna be in the discussion of Most Improved
Russ has had the stand out performance of NBA Tip-off. IDC what anyone says the fact that he literally was giving up lanes he usually abuses just keep the movement in unison and the decision making was amazing. Russ think you found you a little spot to grow
6:47 not another player in the league who can do that, Embiid is insane.
That net was silky
Westbrook looking comfortable that's good to see
Fuck ain't we play Brown & Ish, if we almost beat them witout em we coulda possibly beat em wit them
This dude Beal will be feasting now that walls completely gone
Love to meet joel
I love Westbrook and he's playing well... But he's still settling for that midrange
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Russ always been a favorite of mine i hate the fact that his name doesnt carry the same respect it did a few years ago but i think hes gonna lock in and go mvp mode (not saying hes gonna be mvp)
Westbrook is a perfect fit for the Wizards. He's a leader, makes everyone around him better, and will make that franchise fun to watch again while he's there. He deserves all the acclaim he gets, and not even half the hate he gets thrown.
Westbrook and Embiid friends????
Home court advantage is going to be very helpful this season
FUCK SETH CURRY DID NUN OF THAT SHIT FOR THA MAVS🖕🏾🤦🏾‍♂️
Seth Curry was freaking HUGE this game.  Maybe what the 6ers needed.
Middy Westbrook back
GO SIXERS!!! 🏀👍
If Westbrook can harness his leadership to focus on making plays and not worry to prove anything, the end of the season will look different for the wizards.
Philly can get to the ECF but they don’t want to face the nets to get there
Sixers look good but let’s be honest lol how are they going to play like this against the nets Jordan and The fro gonna are way more physical than the wiz big men
Look at 1:18 Danny green almost fell
Westbrook found his team
I am loving Shake Milton's confidence LETS GOOOOOO
Philly needs to find a way to make Harris a more productive part of this offense.  4 him that is an unaccebtable performance, and he hasn't been performing up to his potential!!!
15 assists with no Hachimora, who i think is going to be considerably better!!!! Westbrook is going to have a monster season!!!!
Great game 🏀
refs won the sixers this game
Mike Scott getting 16mins to go 1-3 and Thybulle getting zero burn?¿   Giving it time...Sixers have maybe the best full roster...Doc and crew have to smooth it out and figure out who does what...Shake looks ready...Tyrese seems the most promising 1st year draft pick in a while...Embiid played just under 35mins and got an easy 29 and 14...Sixers just need to keep building and stay healthy
The Wizards need more depth
Simmons 16, 9, 7 with 3 blocks and 2 steals in 32mins...missed 4 FTs...solid game against a tough team...but all you will hear is what he didn't do...never-ending he made as many 3s as Tobias.  If anyone is traded this season it needs to be Tobias...too many of these rough offensive games for a guy that plays lame defense as well...also he's the highest paid guy on the team who gets a constant pass
For all the great things Westbrook did offensively he still cost them the game on defense losing Ben Simmons countless times off the ball down the stretch for easy layups..
Wait. Philly got Seth Curry, Dwight, Danny green with Ben Simmons,  tobias , & embiid..... They might be🔥
When I 1st started watching the game it seems like the same oh shit different coach different year Ben Simmons reluctant to shoot Harris lost his confidence He's been plant inconsistent since he been here he stealing  money and then come the second half,  shit embiid took the fuc over  I've been saying this shit for years that's how you have to play and he did that I hope he keeps that shit up That young boy messy look like a player and shake Milton looks like he is the man now All we need now is Harris to get his shit together and Ben to start taking more mid range shots 💪🏾💪🏾
that Simmons dunk at the end was all Westbrook's fault. Can't be making a mistake like that at the end of a game
Korkmaz was smoking hot front the 3 yet 0 highlights of that = immediate down vote!
They need to bench Tobias and give shake Milton his spot on the starting 5🤷🏾
The Wizards will have a good season but their interior defense needs to get better.
Sixers should start Shake over Green tbh.
Seth Curry for Josh Richardson was a steal. I don't know what the Mavericks were thinking with that. Seth Curry did nothing but good things for them coming off the bench.
The most important thing is to observe; not to have the division between the observer and the observed, the observer who is the total summation of past experiences then that past observes. That is the source of conflict because wherever there is division there must be conflict.
Russ is def better by himself on this team he played way better tonight than he did on the rockets
Wizards should grab ma mans Steven adams
Ngl as a sixers fan that game kinda scared me but im happy we still got the dub
If the Wizards can work on their defense they might have an outside chance of making the playoffs. Or at least the play-in games.
My boy embiid better be averaging 26 plus a night. No one can stop him
It's ok Westbrook got his triple double 👌
Sixers look like a nice team, and can definitely make some noise in the deeper Eastern Conference than in previous years. They just gotta stay healthy and they could be in for a deep playoff run. But if they continue to not be able to make it past the second round, then Ben Simmons and/or Embiid trade rumors are gonna exponentially grow. And with Doc Rivers as their head coach, even as a Celtics fan i’m low key scared for this team and their future. The Wizards are definitely a playoff team with Russ, who seems to be electrifying as usual. He just elevates the energy of the entire team, and with a young team like the Wizards, that would help so much. Although he may never win a ring, Russ is still one of the best in the league right now, and don’t disrespect him
Wow that was the best game this week
Damn our bench is good Milton,korkmaz,maxey,scott, and Howard. Even our starting lineup is good but I'd replace green with maxey.
Happy to see Westbrook taking a couple of steps in and shooting from mid range. He was dishing the ball well too, I think this is a good fit for him.
How come Mo Wagner didn't play in the second half? Had really good energy in he first half and even played Joel solid. Didn't let him get easy positioning
We did aight for missing rui and playing against the refs
Let’s go sixers🔥
Bryant is way too small
Corny
Nice DefEnsIvE play by westbrick in the final seconds
As a Sixers fan, I like the fact that Embiid took just 1 three pointer even after making it, but I hate the fact that Simmons took no three pointers. C'mon dude how the hell you gonna get better at something if you don't try. At least take one or two three pointers a game. He's a frustrating talent.
https://youtu.be/ZSB93PsfHI4
Russ seems happy his energy different
westbrook and embiid are already cool
Thomas Bryant's offense is nice and a great compliment to Russ, but wow his defense is HORRIBLE
I hated the Westbrook trade when I first heard about it but this team don’t look to bad he got shooters all around him and Beal look like a good fit next to him
Oh they took down BLM so what racism is solved or do black lives not matter anymore?? It was up last year why not this year Adam Silver?? Guess letting the players run the league wasn’t a very good idea last year
Somehow hoping to see Ben, Embiid, Danny, Curry and Dwight play at the same time.
Westbrook’s efficiency is worrisome he shot 9/22
JOKIC OVER EMBID
Brett Brown's coaching woulda lost us this game in the 4th
It was a good game from both sides. What we needed to see from the Wizards is that they could compete and maybe get the W. What we needed to see from the 76ers is moments of dominance where they destroy in at least one area (for the warriors it was their shooting. The Lakers it was their fast breaks. For Miami, it was their defense) 76ers can’t get to the finals if they don’t identify where they’re special. We saw tonight that they’re special when Ben and Embid are respected threats with shooters ready to go.
What this reminds me of is OKC when they got PG & Melo, when Russ was passing the ball so much to let those guys work and they were losing a lot of games behind that, Beal is a really good player but I think Russ has to be #1 or they won't even make the playoffs cause Beal is a good scorer but what I've noticed about him is he doesn't want to take bad/contested shots if need be, he plays like he HAS to get that space to pop. In closing moments, sometimes you're not going to get that space so you have to take tough shots.
Maxey and shake great talent, I'd take shake over Harris any day
Nah Russ is perfect for the wizards if they play like this
Triple Dub King. Always plays hard. 1st time Hall of famer
Let's go sixers, so happy they got the W
Seth Curry 🔥🔥🔥
Thybulle gotta get more mins he’s the best defensive player on the team
I think Westbrook is going to be good contributor on the wizards he can couch the rookies
...I think Russ with the Wizards is lowkey kinda perfect for him
Defense is so important gotta be in the right spots at the right times💯💯
I don't understand.. I like both teams. Why with 25 seconds left, would the guy guarding Ben Simmons just run to guard the center and leave Ben under the basket?
Embiid at 8:54 just straight bodies Bryant, Shaq move with better handle.
did westbrick and embiid get along?!??!
All about health and young star development in the east it's finally competitive completing my team previews by the weekend
Wiz very well may have the beat backcourt in the league, especially with Klay out for the season... I don't think they'll be able to make a deep run or anything, but it's nice to see them playing competitive basketball and I don't think there's any reason this team shouldn't make the playoffs
#LookAtCurryMan now who said the curry’s ain’t clutch ?? 👀 them wizards looking good tho no cap this was fun to watch 🔥 just a weird asf without the fans it’s like watching players scrimmage on 2K
The Wizards won that trade
Seth Curry might be the best scorer on Philly
West brook is really underrated for me cuz he is really great more than he is known for💯
Wizards play terrible defense they gonna be in a lotta shootouts this year because of it
TRAVEL @0:25 no type of gather step literal 3 steps these refs are terrible or the league is rigged
Dwight is the most overrated player I've seen according to the fame and his income 🤢
The complete george amazingly search because fear aerobically arrange plus a picayune panda. tremendous, cultured hubcap
Good game wizards jus couldn’t stop embiid
Wtf... announcer was clearly a 76ers fan
bryant looking like capela's lil brother
Wait til the Sixers really gel
Sixers look the same 😂only time will tell, they need Harden. Ben is not the answer, they won’t beat The Heat, Bucks, or Nets with that current roster. They got outplayed most of that game by Beal and Westbrook. Just imagine Kyrie and KD 😂
davis bertans is being kyle korver
The east is now competitive!
The imperfect collar intraperitonally poke because cork bioinformatically unpack near a jagged football. green grey grieving, succinct basket
the commentator sounds so sad everytime wizards shot go in😂😂😂😂
Crazy... Shows that Harden was the problem in Houston.
Almost got a quadruple double with 6 turnovers. 9-22 40% and 0-2 from 3. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Look at simmons ben and embod jonel think they nice  'man get yo ass up stop acting like you play for hollywood.. what a casually player smhh
Bertans need more minutes
Prob coulda won if Hachi was playin
Happy holidays everyone! Go 76ers! Thank GOD Brett is gone!!!!
9:17 Westbrook summed up
7:21 lol @ Westbrook and Howard🤣
Westbrook and Beal played so good. I was hoping they would win but Sixers had too much fire power. Congrats Ben Simmons for taking the W
Have Deni run PG off the bench when Rui comes back
joel emBED.... 2:00
westbrook! ma nigga!
Westbrook will have one of his best seasons this year. Beal is a much better fit next to him than Harden.
Embiid does look like he has lost some weight intoned up a little bit.
Trade Tobias Harris and  Matisse Thybulle for Zach Lavine... im tired of waiting on Tobias to snap out of it I just think he is a overated player...
Curry didn't contribute much points but if you see the defense of Wizards he can decoy and destroy their defense by confusing the wizard defense. And curry create much space for their core players.
This year is a big move for the Washington sports team. WTF #1 in the NFC east, and abt to go to the playoffs to the Wizards going to have a break out year
Joel pic in the thumbnail looks like 2K!😳
First time I seen Westbrook show sportsmanship after a loss he usually just walks straight to the locker room😭
The east is stacked now, too. Nets will be challenged; might be sent home by one of these two teams
i think they would much better team with hardin as long he does a litttl less with one on one
That mid range jumper butter for Westbrook all the time
LONG LIVE WEED
76 ERS RULES 😍💪🍻
Westbrook blew it at the end by leaving Simmons open under the rim. He's an excellent talent but he still lacks composure in key moments.
Westbrook vs Embiid opening night is just perfect lol and we get this atleast 3 more times haha
Can we give some praise to the final play that was drawn up for Ben and Seth curry those were the kind of plays Kendrick Perkins were talking about for Ben
Westbrook and beal is looking like a real duo👀 westbrook 15 assist will help heal with that 30 ppg while westbrook averages a triple double win win
This game was interesting the whole time didn't disappoint at all. I love how the sixers played decent ball even if it was the first game of season. They played as a whole unit I feel like the Sixers shouldn't trade either Simmons or Harris because I believe in this team and they have great potential to something great. I love the duo of Embiid and Simmons playing together. Doc rivers was a major upgrade from Brett brown. As a sixers fan I am happy all around for this season because this team will play with a lot of effort and play as a whole unit. #SixersNation #heretheycome #76ers
🙏👏
Poor beal.. 😂
76ers
embiid gotta watch out for them burgers.. first 30 seconds 2nd highlight and he was lost already lookin sloppy
I have Just Started Making NBA Videos. I hope you guys will just take a look at it. It's my dream to get a certified youtube channel. I hope everyone who is reading this will just take a look at my video. https://youtu.be/HuqD49TMTTw
its so weird seeing Russell westbrook wearing a number that's not zero lol
Embiid is a ball hog he'd rather take difficult shots then passed to the open man! I seen Seth Curry open a lot with!
Wiz don't even have Rui yet, watch out
I love seeing Westbrook come off the 3pt line taking 2 or 3 steps into an easier Mid-Range 💯🏀😎
The SIxers with a coach that helps them WIN the game in the last minutes is a scary sight...
Russ will average another triple double season.
I like what you do because you my guys may God bless you
Look at Curry man
Why is Robin Lopez still in the leauge?
If Ben had a jump shot the 76ers would be a lot better
Cmon DJ pump in a little more artificial crowd noise!
What a Game, great to see Washington competing again
EMERGENCY 🚨   (Ezekiel 21:8)- “give the people this message from the Lord.”   -gossips, bullies, thugs, etc) can’t list everyone because YouTube censors  (Jeremiah 7:27)- “this is a nation that does not obey the voice of the Lord their God nor receive correction.”   (Ezekiel 23:35)- “And because you have forgotten me and turned your back on me, this is what the sovereign Lord says:   “you must bear the consequences!”   (Ezekiel 21:30)- “ therefore I will judge each of you.

A lot of people are gonna root for the Wizards this season, and I’ll be part of those people. Westbrook bringing the energy is gonna be fun to watch.
I like this sixers team hopefully they can go east finals
5:51 ankle breaker my boy still got it
5:48
*Simmons look good and ready out there.  Can tell he's FOCUSED **#ProppaMusic*
*76ers good win but Washington not bad at all was in the game the whole game.. Very competitive.. I like it **#ProppaMusic*
The warm mask adversely relax because laura significantly drain failing a  fixed field. messy, flowery dinghy
Watching NBA games without any Dunks is like watching Euro league or Australian basketball .
Danny bricks back at it.
I think what people are forgetting about westbrooks game is how many of his passes lead directly to assists and assists only lol. He doesnt get offenses going so sure he can help get this wizards team to 5-8 seed in a meh east but will it equate to any playoff success? No way lol. No hate but until theres an actual offense he, nor will any player other than bron be able to be the system and win the ship lol just doesnt work that way.
I like Westbrook and Beal
Shake Milton is underrated
Embiid gets on my nerves. He needs to play more aggressive the whole game. smh! I didn't start to see him really show what he has until around the 4th quarter. He gotta get a few lessons from shaq or something. Anyway he did do great tonight, but there were moments where Im over here saying man if you dont just bully these folks out your way. Its not time to play nice.
How did overrated Westbrook play
4:19 embiid is a little baby, go cry some more bud
That was the best game I've seen Tonight I like both teams good compition against each other Westbrook is nasty he can't be stop but Philly had to pull that win out they pick up some good players i got Philly 4th seed in the east
Wizards 1 star away
Triple doubles ? Russ been doing that. We need another piece.
The Jordan logo looks so nice on the jerseys
Westbrook was plus 11!! He was playmaking and setting everybody up. When he step off the floor they were giving up leass
So Russ chalkin up those digits while his team loses. Russ gonna be Russ
Westbrock always pads his stats, whether the team wins or loses doesn't matter
Wow Russ and Beal somehow actually works.
Danny needs to get hot early if he's gonna be in the starting lineup
both teams played hard
Yo Ben Simmons definitely traveled at 0:27
maxey is better than fultz man
shake is a buckettt
Westbrook and Beal looking soiled together they almost beat 6ders
U know what’s wrong w/ the NBA is the backboard. Hit that in an angle & bank it in it’s the same amount of points. Cmon man!!!
WASHINGTON Wizards 107 vs 113 PHILADELPHIA 76ers
Well well well I don't think my team (🐮BULLS🐮) are going to be in the finals so I would like to see this Sixers make a deep run with Howard helping the horses of this team. But I  know those Nets and Celtics are the bad boys of this Conference.
no highlight of simmons lob to embiid? cool story bro
Wizards looked amazing Philly did not this should have been a blow out with that much talent
Get Robin Lopez off the squad please 🤦🏻‍♂️ dude should be playing in China fr
Top 50 Never Heard Hip Hop Mike Luch 🔥SPUD WEBB🔥TYLER HERRO REMIX🔥MORE🔥MUST HEAR
Embiiid
Good ol Westbrick. He gonna get you tons of them Triple double losses 😂😂😂 boy shooting more than Beal. Lmaooo
Rui hachimura just has to put up double digits numbers and play solid defense and this wizards team is a 4-5 seed
Westbrook made Washington look way better, man. OKC still misses him 😢
Wizards tried to be too flashy. Sixers played chess. Patience wins games.
SETH CURRRRYYYY
Unlike Harden, Westbrook is willing to play no matter the situation he is in, that's a real one!!!
Simmons traveled on that first lay up
Russ looks healthy. Got his mid range shot back
Deni Avdija looking good
howard and green....
Tight game
juju smith schuster mashup https://youtu.be/jAbwqsuuJTE
What an awful highlight video. Goes from 72-60 with 5:50 left in the 3rd to 85-80 with 9 left in the 4th. You skipped a whole quarter!!!
Good game
Rua was also out so that makes a difference.
Before y’all say Westbrook had an amazing game the man went 9-22 from the field🤦🏻‍♂️
Bens Simmons still ain’t shoot a jump shot. Lol.  Nigga be working all summer on shooting. But don’t shoot
This Sixers team looks so well balanced this year and I loved the spacing for driving lanes/post ups
higher quality pls, this is the NBA.
Philly went and got all those trades and FA.... just to finish 5th and get tossed first rd again...... sucks to suck......
The most boring courtside announcer of the season
Russell Wesbrick
Simmons looks huge
this is what russ wants , he got alot of stats BUT team lost
Russsssss is the real definition of  trash 🤮
Washington have nice squad now 7 or 8 seed likely
Thomas Bryant looks like he gonna break a leg everytime he dunks it
Joel stays out of shape 🤦‍♂️ unprofessional af no one should wear his shoe unless you want to be team below your potential 😂
Let’s goo baby
Westbrook my guy! I’d love to see him win one before it’s all over.
Seth curry was their best pickup, howard was good and green nahh hahaha
They start Bonga over Bertans lol
First win of the season - Embiid walks by Simmons no high five  cmon boys
I didnt watch this yet, did Ben Simmons attempt an actual jumpshot/ 3 pointer?
Hey, how the fuck are they still making money if nobody is at the games ??
Is Rui injured?
Tobias Harris is the worst player on the 6ers. Hot take? I think not. Ok, besides Tony Bradley.
Ok so they let Westbrook hit wide open jump shots nowadays... 🤦‍♂️ Definitely competitive
Westbrick needs to shoot the ball smh like you can’t be like that without a shot
Still don’t know how Tyrese fell to the 76ers
This the Russ I miss talk yo shit !
Looking good wizards
fuck the nba
I’m so happy for Westbrook he had an amazing game
Russ was🔥🔥
Don’t sleep on the wizards they gave us a run for our money !!
Mr trip dub still can’t win 😂 eastbrick
Beal is such a team cancer, he committed one bonehead play after another during the last 2 minutes and you can see he didn’t want to involve anyone else outside of Westbrook and Bryant in the plays.
No reaction from the commentators on the cross over?
Bradley Beal:   No one:     Scott brooks: Hey let’s get Russ a triple double.
Why do people think Russ sucks?
Anybody see Simmons take like 4 steps on that first fastbreak?😂 just me?😅
How is bertans in the nba ? He doesn't do anything...give me a job too 🤷🏻‍♂️
Thomas Bryan't  is improving
Great Job Sixers even though russ had a tremendous game
#FireScottBrooks.
I like Russel Westbrook
I think if Dwight Howard in Wizard... That gonna be Great....
Joel "Imbed" had a solid game
Wizards need a paint protector
Westbrook looking straight weird on that wizards uniform
What an impressive game for wizards, they could win the game if Rui wasn't out :<
Don't give Ben the lane. That dish to Howard early was nice, then the dunk down low late.  I love the size of this team. Hoping Doc Rivers utilizes it better than Bret Brown did. Embid was solid too. Looks focused.
has Robin Lopez ever done anything useful in a game? serious question
That was a good game. Congrats to the Wizards, close one but theyre looking good out thurr.
Don't know why sixers struggled against wizard. Sixers have a lots of good players. Wizards have WB and beal and maybe o'brayant and that rookie   Don't know why WB gets hated all the time TOXICITY. Like you can do better smh.
Honestly, BOTH teams look great, hope both of em make the playoffs
Very good. 😊
The Wizards are going to earn 2 very hard fought games vs. the 76ers in the 2nd round of the ECP and then it's Cancun. That's my prediction, solid overall team, but they really could use some more athletic length / a true big. (As fun as the super small "positionless" guard based lineups are, they are actually nothing more than a gimmick.) I can't  stand Russ normally, but he played with big heart tonight, and was doing his best to get the boys involved. 100% can't hate a man for that.
Love Westbrook with Beal playoffs this year forsure they should consider picking up a athletic defensive big
brodiee
word of the day  "first"
Who knew Washington Wizards were gonna be competitive this season?
Wastebrook dropped the defense on Simons in the final seconds.  tsk.. tsk..
Another 'A' for the NBA what a Competitive Game👊🏾
Garbage highlights. Literally skipped 8 min of the game starting at 5:55
lol Westbrick
If only Ben Simmons could shoot decently. Oh man... the sixers would be a force to be reckoned with.
6:14 is how evryone felt
Warriors should trade wiggins and looney for Ben simmon
76ersssssss!   DON’T BE SILLY.....ROOT FOR PHILLY
Wizard need Star Center to improve team defense
Good game for a game one.... We can continue to jel knowing it's our first season with Doc Rivers and other players.... Sixers and Brooklyn in the ECF...... Save the file....
Tobias Harris needs to go. Who wants him 😂
Westbrook got a triple double and a loss, just like always. Same old Russ.
Wizards 6th seed
The Wizards are actually pretty fun to watch. Good ball movement and unselfish play, all with great team attitude and dynamic. I think as the season goes forward, chemistry between everyone will improve. All of that, plus a promising rookie in Deni and his development, the Wizards shouldn't be slept on and a playoff push from them doesn't seem unlikely. Difficult, but not unlikely.
Wow. This was a great game!!!!
5ixer5.... 5iixxxxeeerrrrr5555, SIXXXXXXXXEEERRRRRSSSSS......
Embiid is a beast 😤
Commentator starts with a roast lmlfaooo
Credits to Seth Curry
When Rui comes back Wizards gonna be lit
Tyrese maxey is going to be good everytime in 2k he's ROTY
Embiid
Anyone who calls Westbrook a stat padder doesn’t know a thing about basketball
Trade Simmons for harden at this point
5:40 Simmons knew that screen was there, he miss stepped, he got broke.
As a Houston fan, have fun Wizards fans lol! Westbrook will continue to have a great stat line on paper but HORRIBLY inefficient! I'll go back now to my own Achilles tearing injury prone team lol.
wizards play in the last 1 minute: do not give the ball to westbrook
Russ is the absolute best version of himself when he’s ball handling, play making and not feeling like he has to shoot 3s. Love his jumper!
Wizards didn’t have Rui and were that close👀 don’t sleep
Fck wizard can fight
Bench Danny Red
4:10 😬
This Sixers guard Maxie will be a star in NBA...great pickup.
I guess they don't realize that Russel is a ball hog
Beal why did u have to stay in dc bud come to the Lakers
Embiid went beast mode in the 4th. We need more of this throughout the season. God Bless!
Youtube really getting comfortable with these 2 unskippable ads
I see more arc on Russ' jumpshot 👍 It used to be more line-drive before.
So it's not true that Stephen Adams & the thunder coaching staff orchestrated a play for Russ to get uncontested rebounds. He prove to his haters that his quickness & athleticism were the reason why he got those  rebounds.
I like what I saw from both team.
Russell Westbrook is a action, fun, and great player.
Wizards look great tho 💪🏻
Why don't they use Bertans more..
Seeing howard in a sixers jersey was weird
Bucks and Celtics full game .. https://youtu.be/-4JbdzPhqVE
Westbrook laid out simmons faster than kendal jenner
Wizards looking alotttttt better though, the East looking way tougher this year
wizards will be better this season with westbrook!!!
DID RUSS SHAKE HANDS AT THE END 🤯🤯🤯
Wow both team sucks. Somebody had to win. Poor defense from both team
Howard looks even more stupid! Lol!
Ben Simmons Is Literally Walking around w the ball 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ REFFF
Tbh, the nba players in today's era look like college players. I feel like this isnt nba no more tbh
Did Ben Simmons Pull a Jumper yet???
Brodie looking good.
WELP....
Seth might be a big deal over there
The wizards need someone to guard embiid imagine if it was Jokic, Thomas Bryant got cooked
I miss Danny green. When he  played for the Lakers
Milton - Black Panther?
BLACKS MEXICANS AND NATIVE AMERICANS AND JAMAICANS WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE REAL HEBREW ISRAELITES OF THE BIBLE RESEARCH NO EVIL NO LOBSTERS NO CRABS NO CATFISH WOMAN CANT WEAR PANTS
who the fuck had pink eye 👁 in both eyes 👀???
Can’t lie I like what I’m seeing from Westbrook gaining the respect from his new teammates or trust I think everyone respect what he do keep it up and don’t gain it then use it in a bad way 💯
Good game by both teams, alittle confusing on D at the end be Westbrook and Bryant. Westbrook should've just stayed with Ben.
This dude Jordan bought the whole league
I'm so happy for seth man, dude is a hot commodity rn but not to long ago the dude wasn't even good enough to be in the league, hard work pays of man
God Westbrook is one of the most annoying guys In the league. No wonder nobody likes playing with dude. Glad philly got more than one person who can shoot a 3 now 😂
Let’s go Philly
Shake Milton looks like black panther actor
Can we waive Tobias and sign J Cole? Nobody will notice.
Why did Westbrook give up the paint like that 😫😫😫
The game is over when RB got the triple double
Why Joel looks like he on 2k21 lmfao
The wizards are going to make the playoffs this season.
Russell probably flosses with a towel.
Russels gonna remember that. You know he got that competition 🔥
5:49 Oh damn Ben, All defensive player?
Westbrook is a perfect fit for the Wizards seriously you can see the connection he has with Beal 👌🏽
76ers roster tho
The complete boat terminally fail because footnote basically chew regarding a abashed certification. hoc, bad caption
I see Washington is still playing the no defense game, especially in the second half lol
I get so happy when westbrook uses his strengths which is mid range and slashing instead of chucking up 3s
Russ looking good with my squad. We'll do just fine....jussssst fine. 😎
Tobias Harris is so bad. Morey needs to find a way to trade him for someone who can shoot.
Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!! Gortat has hair.
Russ gone make Bryant a all star this year while taking the wizards to the playoffs. They one elite wing piece away from being a top team in the east
This NBA era is weak no defense they just let players pass like nothing. We got 2 big man looking at each other smh
seth curry a still for the sixers
The voice of the announcer was just pure
Ben Simmons probably thanking covid for the no crowds (5:49)
ill be the 76ers mvp
The disrespect to Westbrook
Wizards sure have a terrible defense
I am a 76ers fan i'm not going to lie man we came out sleeping, the Wizards had us on the ropes, I knew Russell Westbrook and Bradley  were coming to ball , s/o to my 76ers we pulled it off i'm keeping my faith I hope we could do something with Doc Rivers on the sideline , I hope we don't trade none of the stars , we can't come on the court sleeping though it's only 72 games this season due to the pandemic so we need to lock in 100 % Lets work harder 76ers 🏀
Even though they lost, I’m impressed with the Wizards. They actually looked like a legitimately solid basketball team.
Good game
Like how they used Embiid
Triple-Double Machine Russell Westbrook is Back.
That bryant dude looks like a kid throwing a tantrum whenever there is contact lmao😂
Yall 76ERS better make the trade for Harden before he change his mind and stays...
It's gonna be a long year for wizards.
Sixers should start Dwight!!
Seth Curry's passing is superb
I noticed after Westbrook was removed they started losing hard
Great to see the sixers bounce back from a horrendously bad 3rd quarter in regards to offense. Hate to say, but these refs were also TERRIBLE. If i see another late foul call, ima go crazy lol #ttpstill #OTTNO
Brodie out here ballin showing htown what they’re missing 😤
Westbrook with his first triple double this season.
Tobi needs to get traded can't spot up and his off rebounds are....
Watching Russ with the wizards rn, really got me saying fuck Harden.
Russ is my favorite player I hope he is gonna be in the mvp candidates cuz he is back and leading a team and that’s when he is best
The Process Embiid
Looks like westbrook is triple double hinting again btw wuts danny greens stat line
Ben, where are you going? 5:47
15 asts that is nuts
Wizards have so much potential to contend for a playoff spot! Russ’s midrange game is looking lethal! I like the fit!  Looking forward to seeing how this team develops.
Is russ and joel are good now
What did Dwite Howard say him he looked mad.
Ben Simmons 3pt. is the real vaccine to Covid-19.
They lost, but it was a close one..having Russ clearly makes this team better
I was ready to be so angry after this game.
i missed this westbrook lets goo
Robin Lopez no defense
Wizards the perfect team for Westbrook they always push the pace
The amount of mid range shots I’ve been seeing this year makes me happy.
All this to get bumped in the first😂😂
I said it before the season  Sixers be coming out of the East a number one seed... Yall niggas go ahead and laugh..
Shake and Bake! 😂 G🏀 Sixers
Russ is gonna be much better when he’s the primary ball handler. Not more efficient, but better
Beal played fantastic tonight. I was blown away with how well he played. If it weren’t for Embiid taking over the 4th we (Sixers) would’ve lost by like 15.   Also Doc already looks like a much better coach than Brett brown...
Westbrook went off today bruh, suffice to say the wizards had a fantastic offseason
Excited to see the potential of Maxey..then combine that with a Maxey/Milton backcourt..🔥
Westbrook is lit bruh💥💥
GREAT GAME SIXERS PHILLY STAND UP STOP THE VIOLENCE 215 HAPPY HOLIDAYS❤❤🙂💯🏀🏀🏀
Y'all should leave the highlights for houseofhighlights😂😂😂 bcuz NBA channel sucks when it comes to editing.
I always thought westbrook is at his best hitting the mid range shot he has the fastest pull up like carmelo
Wizards lost this one, but they'll be a handful this year. Who would have ever guessed KD and Russ would end up leading the east coast back to prominence?
Damn Wizards did good for opening night. Seeing a lot of good things happening. Can’t wait to see my boy Rui back then shit’ll really get done 👀
this shouldve said wizard highlights. i saw the 76ers score going up but didnt even see them score the points.
Sixers is now officially brooklyn nets problem..
Just can't beat the 76ers at home 😀
this commentator is obviously a phili fan
I really think Houston and Washington won the Russ and wall trade
Actually surprised westbrook showed sportsmanship to embiid after the game
How many wins are in the  philadelphie and how many loss they have
Lmao the commentator sounds like he dont like the wizards or he a philly fan😂😂
Miss Dwight on the Lakers
Russ having a triple double but let simmons score in the last seconds 9:19
this season is going to be the most competitive the east has been in the last decades, with bucks, sixers, wizards upgrading, nets back, celtics improved, and miami runnning it back.
Tobias has to go we need to replace him with someone who can create there own shots at will, and Danny is still building brick houses
wizards making the right decision.
Ok so ben still isn't shooting and embiid is shooting jumpshot 👌 sixers way to stay pretty much the same.
“Joel emBID”
Shake is the GOAT! I will not debate this! I'm right. You're wrong!
It just dawned on me that Westbrook is playing under Scott Brooks again.
Imagine harden traded to wizards for beal.
No Rui Hachimara too
On top of that as for the wizards, I’m actually excited for them. Beal and Westbrook should be one of the top 5 backcourts in the nba, and I think Bertans will be solid this year. I look to see guys like Avdija and Thomas Bryant to play well. I think they both will. Westbrook will help make Thomas Bryant look better with all his dimes, and Avdija needs to find his way and play just like he played in Europe. Create his own shot, play off the dribble, catch and shoot, and crafty defense. He will be a good young star I think
Let go 76ers 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The epitome of moral victory! 💪🏿
russ still padding stats and airballing shots nothing has changed
Mavs fan here. Overall that was a good game by both teams. Curry seems to fit well with any team he’s on. I like seeing him play with Simmons they will be nice together, it seems like Joel is only scoring on buckets that he makes for himself and I hope that somebody can step up for philly as a facilitator and work with embid, pick and roll, pick and pop, etc. I wanna see somebody help embid is what I’m saying he always has to do his work on his own.
Where's Rui? Is he injured?
Where is Peoli?
Fire scott brooks he puts out the worst subs ever terrible coach
Wizards are one superstar away to be contenders
Why're they both wearing home jerseys
And that’s how you play with ben Simmons....put him in the paint and in the post cut to the basket and your gold...loving Seth...would love to see a Dwight and Embid at the same time a bit to see what it looks like but looking good so far
The Sixers bench is very strong. I'm a little worried about Tobias Harris, Green & Curry. But Shake and Dwight look 🔥 🔥 🔥
They might surprise some teams in playoffs this year. Wizards look exciting
Russ NEEDS a few more abled players on his team.  As talented as he is, and the assistance from Bradley,  the Wizards would do extremely well with two more serious contributors on the court.
When the refs want to change the complexion of games, they start calling those weird fouls like moving screen, even though the screener didn't move. I've seen that numerous times over the years against the Wizards. It seems cliche to blame refs, but the refs kept Philly in the game long enough to where they could pull it together late. I don't even think the 76ers could tell you how they won this game.
this was a great game
Nice
Thomas Byrant candidate for MIP
Does anyone know what happened to Hachimura?
when the wizards get ruri back , they MIGHT be dangerous in the east.
Tobias gotta go...
I feel like shake milton could be a lou Williams type of scorer off the bench
Dwight go back to LA. They needed your physicality and defense more than Gasol’s passing and shooting.
9:20 by what metric are fouls called in the nba? If that is not one I dont understand how harden gets tickled and gets fouled.
Embiid with 12 straight
this was a tight ass game... glad nba is finnaly back
76ix are boring.
I’m glad that Seth curry is starting🔥
LAKERS NATION UNSTOPPABLE SOLID
Wow. Did westbrook just congratulate embiid? Westbrook really doing good this christmas, first durant then embiid. Wow 2020.
Don’t sleep on beal and Westbrook 👀
Ben Simmons earning ROTY over Donovan Mitchell is going down as one of biggest mistakes. Simmons is so overrated its ridiculous, he has been in league like 5 years now and he still cant shoot, never shows up in the playoffs and he is more injury prone than embiid and that's tough.  I feel for sixers fans
8:12 I mean it’s hard to have a more open layup then that
If embiid learns to keep the ball close to him holding the ball in the post he wont lose it so much. Great game from him still.
Shake Milton looks like a sixth man of the year candidate if he doesn’t end up starting
Russ playing like himself triple double machine
Finally Waiting for This DANG Video To Upload
Russ with the triple dub in his first game
It is not a Crossover Westbrook clearly tripped off Ben Simons😂
It was a fun gAme to watch!
The Sixers need to trade Tobias. He doesn’t make big time shots he only makes them when the Sixers are blowing out the other team.
And we had no Rui
Wizards are better than the Celtics right now change my opinion
Beal had 31 on 11/22 FG but the NBA put Westbrick because he stat padded his way to a triple double and shot 9/22 and had 6 TOs
You know I think Westbrook and Beal will work better than most people think
76ers have the team / coaching / front-office to be a top 2 seed in the East.  Let's see if they put it together this season.
🔔🔔🔔🔔
I play a ton of Basketball. cool video. go jazz blazers celtics
As a OKC fan always enjoy watching Russ what a beast.
Look at curry man
Embiid is back !
Russ providing 6-22 FG.
Sixers starters 2-14 from 3, so much for more spacing🤣 Shake and Korkmaz saved this game for us
Russ can lead the wizards to the playoffs but Embiid is to much and Shake went off tonight with 19
Russ got a triple double
Russ is still good
Where was Rui?? They would’ve won with him🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️❗️
I did what westbrick did, I just didn’t have the cameras on -Flightreacts
If the wizards can improve their defense especially in the interior they can make a deep run in the playoffs.
(First) 47.
Shake milton had 19, icic
the sixers won but I feel like the wizards played better. That might not make sense but the wizards did a lot better than what i thought russ surprised me a lot
beal with 31
Thomas Bryant sold the shit out this game
I don't know how he'll play in the playoffs, but in the regular season Westbrook is gonna put up crazy numbers in the regular season playing in the East

Will Doc make the Sixers into a top 4 team in the East 🤔?
Look at Russ man, proving the haters wrong
Joel Embiid in the W tonight : 29 PTS - 14 REB - 58 FG% - 1/1 3PM
Wizards fans should be excited to watch Westbrook and Beal, they could have a good playoff run
I’m first to say first
🙋‍♂️
RUSSELL WESTBROOK IS A GROWN MAN. Looking like MVP Russ there.
Bruh
Seth Curry was a great pickup and he showed it tonight
Second
Early.
