For the CB role I think you should sign Antonio Rudiger from Real Madrid and sign a LB Alphonso davies from Bayern Munich and for A Striker Sign Edin Dzeko
Cristiano Ronaldo

Pls do you play dis or watch dis (Manager mode)
You really need to increase the difficulty on which you play. You can’t make every player 99 rated winning multiple ballon dors and CL’s. That makes the videos unrealistic and monotonous. Please change that.
Mbappé

Nordan Amrabat Cracked Me Up😂
Prime modric
Bro called onana talent
Brally

halland
SUBSCRIBE to S2G
Bro buying Rodrygo wasnt realistic fr
For midfielder get szoblaszlai
Striker please
You need to buy mbappe
Only cause maguire is a meme doesn't mean you have to sell him I would put him and Johny Evans at defender role
Gavi
Phil Foden & Jobe Bellingham
Frankie de jong
4:08 this aged well 😂😂😂

You forgodtbefindende about eriksen😂
Neymar or ronaldo

Sid OUT! Haha, I support my team Manchester United and we need new manager Sid has been the worst so far! Is Rodrygo even a player??? Haha Sid I'm just kidding keep it up! 😅😅
Try to sign rudiger sid  But love your videos❤
Hi you should sign… MESSSSSSIIII!!!
maybe buy bellingham
I have fc24 and I don’t get the cutscene for when the game starts or any cutscene 11:35
Give garnacho chances hes good
For the AMF  position  I'm thinking about  converting Bruno to a CAM. For the striker position sign the 2nd goat aka Ronaldo
Add Ronaldo for houlund
I think you should let Garnacho play more
Can u make Højlund the super star?❤
You actually play real Ten Hag ball...boring  😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
I’m watching this in 2045 and it’s still a banger
Hoi- land
Fred🎉🎉🎉
Mbappe sign mbappe
I am a fan of Manchester united ❤❤sg2
Hey Sid, for a midfielder that will be a tremendous fix for Manchester United. I think Yves Bissouma is the right person for the job. His dribbling, passing and technical ability is just what Manchester United needs.
for the midfielder have jude bellingham
Kevin de Bruner
Sign  vinicious
I think you should sign valverde as a midfeilder in you team he's cooking right now
ronaldo
🩷
Haaland
Sign a better midfielder
I will sign for man Utd
You'll have gotten MODRIĆ or KROOS there getting abit old u think. They'd retire there
I don't know where to training my squad players please thanks
How to stop your team player to transfer to other team
can you sign Filip Krastev
Sign kroos he will link with casemiro
S2G watch yourself
I am interested in whether it is possible to learn player traits, and also whether as a manager you can decide to watch the match and not play
Can you give me a ps4 with fc24
You need sign Goretzka and de Jong
Benzema
not realistic 💔
Sign saka for Anthony
You should do arsenal
Halland
Bro Man U are counter attack fc
Striker haland
😮Kroos
This is the Standard edition right?
Maybe Barrela or valverde for centre mid coz they are very versatile
Get de gea back
Ronaldo (add him)
nooooo my 80+ alts😂😅
you need to sign kimmich
😮 how can you sell mainoo!?
I think you can sign Bellingham that will be amazing
Bring back de gea
Avanti
Sight Ronaldo Messi and halland
You should sign Ronaldo, Messi,halaand,
Goretzka is a Good option for a new cm. And Griezman for a ST
If you want a 5 star striker you want to go with haaland
Fortnight
sign me whit number 13
ten hag should watch this. he'll learn a lot.
And even camaviring
Hi heard that u need a player u should buy declan rice .for your cb sergio ramos ,picue’ st jesus    Joa’o felix ferran torres neymar

modrich
Hey bro im your biggest fan of your YouTube channel i wish i can meet you and i hope to see you soon Sid !
Veratti
21:14 why were there 8 red cars
9:55 black moment 😢
Amrabat you should 100% try to make him higher rated he is an absolute Beast
Try to sign Camavinga to replace Mount and sell some players
Bellingham
Vlahovic
LB Nuno mendes  CM Pablo Gavi  CB Timber Plays for arsenal I believe
u can try different players as midfield , run from the norm such as frenkie de jong or barella. try out arda guler, szoboszlai, maddison, konrad laimer, nkuku, odegard, vitinha or kamada. Pleaseeee just sell mount , he is no good at all 😂and for wingers, try out Doku, lamine yamal, bowen, gnabry or leao. for Rb, as sub or differential than bissaka, u can have trippier, cash, achraf hakimi, malo gusto or reece james. Finally, if things still dont work out, time to change your formation to 4-2-3-1 or 4-4-2. Thank me later 😁😁😁
Hakimi bro
When you are about to play a match.   how Can I change some players or change the formation or tactic I cant find it
harry is overhated tbh and that's why he plays so badly because he has little confidence
Being a Man Utd manager in FC24 is easier than real life. You don’t need to wipe those superstars ego on their ass
But ferenkie de jong
I did what you did but I got a short  suite one
Do a Roma career mode
Day 15 of asking you to start vinícius Jr at LW or RW
haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa boring video🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱
You should sign some youths from the previous FIFA as now their overall is better.
Mbappe ST
Still 7 player on bench. Fuck EA
You got the money pick up valverde
Hi can you please share to me how to enable the pre game scene? The warmup and changing room scene.  Mine goes straight to the pitch walkout   Thanks!
The fact that he just did garnacho dirty
Kevin De Bruyne
The graphics are poor
Rodrygo is so unrealistic
The show was good, but you suck at playing it 😂
on mid field buy jude bellingham
Halland
get   ronaldo
Pep gurdiola reaction 💀
Try to get a good striker as in Osimen
Kdb
Haland
Oshimen
we need episode for united your channel is hella fire
For midfielder maybe Pedri or camavinga
bro in the old times he sounded like a nerd
Give out a copy of ea fc 🫣
Haaland
Get Ronaldo please
Sign Erling  Haaland
Hope you do great in managing man united. You are one of my favourite youtubers!🎉
I think you should sign bissouma for that cm role brilliant at dribbling is having a great start to the season and for rb  joa cancelled keep up the good work
Nordan Amrabat🙈
Mordic
Pedri or Enzo F de jong
Keep mason mount pleeaaaassssee
He says Case needs support but didn’t use Amrabat (for wolves)
Like- Haaland Comment- Højlund
Mess. St
Mess
CR7😊
Luke know good choice
Maddison he’s got the pace
Sign Szoboszlai Dominik
Are you playing the match or watching it?
How bout you sign verrati or gumares
Get de jong please❤ love your   vids
How do you make those celebration's when they score?
15:20 thank god they fixed that, in my career mode, psg signed pedri and virgil van dijk.
Brooo learn to defend properly 😭Damnn. Good content though❤️.
do hibernian next sid
Valverde and Camavinga for the mid
You should sign Evan Ferguson as a back up striker
You should get Haaland
For midfield sign: Camavinga or Bruno Guimares For right back sign Frimpong
Sign Toney - allows Hojlund to still become the star, give Mount a chance - rotates with amrabat/eriksen, I'd also let the right-backs compete with each other but you could go for Frimpong or Mazraoui.
Trust Hannibal
I LOVE YOUR CONTENT SID
SID U NEED TO REPLACE FULLBACKS WITH IAN MATSON AND TRIPPER IAN IS YOUNG SO HE WILL GROW OR U CAN BUY BALDE
Do PSG next!!!
Love your content!!
Kane
Sign sobozli😂😂
Suiiii comeback
De gong
Buy Dr jong
Rodrygo coming off the bench?😅
Enough. Sell Garnacho and Buy Kvaratskhelia.
Buy a rb like frimpong because he is very fast and a good defender
Bro am your first South African🇿🇦🤲 fan can you send me PS4❤🤲
The pack the boss tactics is killing me💀💀😂
C.Ronaldo
United sucks IRL and in game 😂
Do Liverpool next pls
Looks like FIFA 23
Use Amrabat in midfield and sign him on a permanent deal
V well made cheers ❤🧿⭐️🙌
hes getting mad at mount because he decided to chip the keeper at point blank, just finding excuses at this point
Unbelievable... they have added every football club in UCL except Crvena Zvezda... pathetic
4 day gang 😭
For the midfielder position you should get thouameni as he was linked with utd irl and he would help the team a lot now at right back position I think mazraoui would fit pretty well
Osihmen
you ever gonna do a manager for brighton
Sign someone like Camavinga or  Gavi for the Midfield and then for the Striker  position I would sign Hlozek from Bayer Leverkusen  or you could sign  Alvarez
The most shocking thing in this video was that Burnley was in 10th place.
Bro not to be rude but, i'm from denmark and i would just ask you if you could say hojlund or højlund insted of håland or haaland or what you're saying;) But great video can't wait for more fc 24 coontent
Hi, I'm new and I have the game pass ultimate, and I wanted to know if EA sports 24 will have the full game for the game pass?
Martin Baturina, Alex Scott, Leonidas Stergiou are my first 3 signings
Manchester United  my guy
Sign Caicedo and Estupidan the Ecuadorian duo
Gonçalo Ramos he is cheap and is good he will fit in the team and has potential to grow, also for the cm position you should buy De Paul from Atletico or Frenke de jong but it will not be realistic as he declined manchesters offer
Rasmus Højlund is pronounced Hoyloond
Let amrabat play
James Maddison
Do juve
I think for the st position you should look at Julian Alvarez or Gabriel Jesus as Alvarez has alot of potential and Jesus has the finishing Man United want
You should buy barrela
You should manage Real Madrid
You should sign Gavi in the midfield
Dont sell harry mauire
For CM I would recommend KDB
put harry maguire
buy valverde for midfield
Frenke de jong sounds realistic
Pcq: Sid I think you should go over to bayer leverkusen and you can make signings like hincapie and frimpong for the cb and rb roles then you can get a way better midfielder than mount with paqueta
No people who say eth out are very wrong give him tim PS YOUR PLAYING AS MASON MOUNT YOU CANT CRITICISING HIM YOU SHOULD LOOK YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR AND SAY ITS YOUR FAULT.
It should've been CHELSEA 😢😢. Appreciate the entertainment though
They're 8th now
Dusan Vlahovic please!
You should sign the goat Neil Etheridge, he's a lot better than Onana in real life.
Di Maria 'n Foden two great wingers
Onana doing onana thing😂😂😂
Bye mbappe as st and u will win every game😂❤🎉
You have to sign son in Left wing
Why does my guy keep calling him Rasmus Håland?
i just got fc 24 early too!
Sign camavinga
Why’s he acting like he didn’t accept the Antony move 💀
Sign oshimen
SIGN Griezmann
keep RASMUS SINCE HE CAN REALESE  his potential
Messi or ronaldo
I will never miss a video
i think you should get rodri or kimmich
kylian mfrappe
You should play hannibal Mejbri they play him in real life sometimes. Plus you can develop him into the next Paul Scholes!
Bro has a Ballon d'or and World Cup on his trophy cabinet to show how much of a living legend he is
Im sorry but as a danish person i Got kinda annoyed at The “Holland” Pronounciation its pronounced Hoej-Lund
Signing rodrigo was so unrealistic
All the cutscenes in the game is it only for ps5 or also for ps4?
for midelfield you have a lot of options because of high budget. I could see you signing in Jamal Musiala or Florian Writz. But  you can also  go with Valverde or even De Jong wich was linked with man utd before.
Barcelona
Get Ronaldo for 75m to 85m 😮
Rodrygo woulf actually be a good signing for us irl we struggle in that rw position
Sign Devyne Rensch he is a really good right back with amazing potential. I have used him before and he is a baller.
Mbappe striker good
Banchester united
Ronaldo would be a good striker
FINALLYYYYYYY
New right back
His name is HøjLUND not HOLLAND!
De jong
Like for s2g to sign pedri and valverde
You can buy xavi simons
Rasmus Holland🤣🤣
Mbappe sign him pls 😓😓😢😭
rasmuss holland😂
Bellingham
Pedri is the midfielder you need he has high potential
Put rashford as st garnacho as lw and de jong at cm cancelo at rb
Sign kdb and haaland
hey sid i love your videos keep it up and i think you should sign a new goalkeeper because ohana a bit sus
Sign mbappe 🤣🤣🤣💀
Did keep it real
Messi and Ronaldo
23:05 don’t u dare disrespect forest or u will lose a subscriber. U have zero ball knowledge anyway
Jude Bellingham
He called amrabat nordin 😂
As your rb try to sign hakimi hes great in both defense and attack
Jude bellinghen
Not gonna lie... them shadows are way too dark. Like everything just becomes a silhouette. I know shadows are a big thing but damn
maybe you should put Rashford on ST/CF and buy Winger like Kvara or Vinicius... and for CM I think De jong would be good
You should get Pavard he has alot of potential
You should sign trent Alexander arnold
Ronaldo striker
pls get Messi and frenkie de jong on the team
Don't sign a striker you have greenwood revive his career
You need szoboszlai dominik on the midfield
keep hojlund!!!!!!!!!
Try Lukaku or Dybala They should be good with the upgrades
Ronaldo must have a chance to go back to man united
You should sign Frankie dejong in the midfield as he's been linked to the club and Will suit your play style
You should sign Frankie dejong in the midfield as he's been linked to the club and Will suit your play style
You should sign Karim adeyemi as he's quick and he will fit into your wing play tactic
2 day gang 👇🏻
@S2G I just got the game today, I'm trying to play a career mode but it feels like the game is relatively easy. I'm playing on ultimate but for some reasons the CPU aren't running after my players. Can someone help me?
Can l get one
Sign pedri for mid fielder
make garnacho no 7
Sign Arder guler
Spurs only brought Maguire because their trophy-less brains thought Maguire was a good ST against Man UTD 😤😤😤💀💀💀.
Or Pedri
You should sign Jude Bellingham
No more suit in champions league they got rid of iconic music and player line up gone 😢😢😢
Are those cut scenes at the start of the game only for next gen or can everyone have them?
Cr7
So for the midfield your gonna want someone like Fabian ruiz or Kone for st it’s gotta be jonathon Davids
He should buy Guimares but the other vidéo is already in ligne
I think for the lw you can sign alexis Sanchez
stop calling him Haaland
CM Bellingham or camavinga
Hey new subscriber here  I would like to see the combinations of   Garnacho, Hojlund and Rodrygo in forward (by the way you could have worked with Pellistri as a backup RMF, because he is quite a prospect. If possible can you bring him back?) Bruno as AMF, Casemiro and Amrabat as DMF where you can use Amrabat to go up as a CMF too Reguilon Martinez Todibo and Dalot/Bissaka as the Defenders! (Bring in Reguilon as he is quite an explosive Fullback and he can actually be good for the tactical style you are using! He will support Rashford/Garnacho pretty good) And yes, I would also be grateful if you can give a chance to the GK, Altay Bayandir instead of Onana because he is a great upcoming Goalkeeper and he will do just fine!  For depth you can have any players you wish for!  Thank you, if incase you use this players and the formation which I am saying is 4-2-1-3 or rather 4-3-3 (Attacking)
Could you become the mananger of Arsenal in EA FC 24
Did he just say rodrygo comes off the bench ??? lmaooo 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sid saying its a new feature for teams to make more realistic and smart transfers  Liverpool:am I a joke to u
Exactly copy of my life
ronaldo
Fati for ST ur a Barça fan too so u probably know how to use him bc u’ve played with him a decent amount of times
Mate I love this man's content
I see they changed.... very little
keep hojlund
I will not like because I'm chelsea
Frenkie de Jong is a great player
finishing mN
need to play eriksen mor often he is class
Plz Fix Harry Maguire Career 😢!
1 year gang?
The best formation is a false nine for wing play so instead u can play Bruno at the false nine since anyway as a midfielder he doesn't defend
21:15 Did anyone see that Man Utd and Nottingham forest both had 4 red cards?
i think you should trust young players in the squad more. hojlung, pellistri, garnacho and others definitely deserve a chance
@coachali
HIS NAME IS NOT HOLLAND IS HOJLUND
Sign Cristiano Ronaldo plssssssssssassaassssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
I knew it  "Its the same game"😂
Don't lie. you did thus because they have the largest fanbase and you'll make the most money.
I should be criticizing him more😂😂😂
For RB sign Kimmich
Why won't you do Liverpool
Sign Jude Bellingham
You should sign Gabri Veiga
Kills me that he said nordin amrabat
Do Real Madrid
Buy hm son and put him in striker pos
Cristiano Ronaldo
Sign Dusan Vlahovic, he has had a bad season and we must get him in for cheap and make him a Crucial player since he has been romoured to Manchester United this summer and in the winter transfer.
your net career should be liverpool since there having a rebuild
I don’t think signing rodrygo is realistic bcuz he is being used as a second striker in real and gets game time but it’s still a great signing for 55+ million
Manage to man city
Try florian wirtz bruh
Keep on the content S2G love to see it

Bring Mason back to ot

I love you sid
bro sold my man pellistri & mainooo😭
How u can sell kobie ??? Pellistri and kobbie are our future.   Good that u strengthen our training coaches which mu management should learn.
sign Joshua Kimmich from FC Bayern Munchen or sign Marco Verratti  from PSG
de bruyne for mason he might be real expensive but id give it a shot
Add jud Bellingham and Cristinao Ronaldo
PCQ: Valverde will be amazing. CM/RW/RB/CAM
Pls do wolverhampton

Unpopular Suggestion- You should change ONANA  He is not even saving simple shots in game
Bring the manager of your. Face back p”ease😢
Get mason greenwood  The goat
Sign nicola barella or u gae
PLEASE SIGN DIANGANA
Hey s2g I really want ea fc24 but my parents can't afford It
Sign Mohammed kudus for the midfield. Personally I think I’m fifa he’s underrated
For the Midfield I think that you should sign Thomas Muller or Seko Fofana. About the RB position either Frimpong or Alexander Arnold. Btw love your vids❤🎉.
And he has 6 play styles
Sonic fc 24 😂😂 Patetic play.
You should bring back a club CRISTIANO RONALDO 🎉
Considering that the club just came from a window you don't need to make too many changes it's not realistic
You want to get rid of Antony?? You need to keep is realistic. He is United's best RW with pending issues of course
BRING THE NIGERIAN KING HOME, VICTOR OSIMHEN HOMECOING
so u sold him to Liverpool but don’t like that he left to a rival?
show me new jersy al nassr pls🙏🏻
Sid what happened to you always starting off w barca
brilliant video as a Manchester united fan I love it
Ffs bro it's a rebuild you cabt take rodrygo who is doing well in a club like Madrid and bring him to a club like Man u that are not doing well it defeats the realism in the Game... TF
Scenes line-up was removed😢
You don’t need a new right back
Why would you sell anthony
For RB you should sign jeremie frimpong
1 day gang
Whoever the one editing your videos, he needs a raise
Sign ronaldo
sell the goal keeper onana plz
Bro says rodrygo is a bench player does he even watch football😭
Osiemen
Sign Kovačić for mid
Add Joško Gvardiol
No line ups and scoreboard are not matching real life update ea
Love
Here before 1m   👇🏼
Amrabat 80 and Eriksen 83 is this a joke 🤣
You should sign Adeyemi, he is rapid and a super solid striker.
Worst graphics
Sign Gavi and Hakimi
Pronounce Hojlund's name properly. Instead of mispronouncing and annoying everyone
Pedri
so unrealistic
Rodrygo zalazar is a good option he’s young and has high potential
keep højlund
You could sign Trent from Liverpool and move him to cm he has 88 potential or if you have the funds give pedri a try who has 92 potential or valverade who has 91 potential:)
Yes a Manchester United Career Mode
Sign Musiala World class CAM
Sign Xavi Simon
Sign Kim mim Jae
Sign oshimen cause he was linked in the summer and maybe and Leon goretzka because he a good player for Man U but doesn’t get a lot of game time at Bayern
Buy harry kane and de Jong
Lost 2-1 to Wolves at Old Trafford nvm I’m S2GOut
You should sign Valverde we were linked with him so it would also be quite realistic
Sign Valverde
What team do you support?
I think you should sign someone like alvarez from man city because hes a youngster and a super player off bench
bro stop playing the games and sim them
Antony is trash and I am a man united fan he never passes
Hey Sid a good suggestion for RB would be Jeremie Frimpong as he is still very young and he would work very well with the overlapping tactics.
Frimpong on the RB
the game isnt out and there is still somethings that ea have not finished and the game is insane
Bro hates  mount so much he purposely missed a easy goal
Holand 😭😭
Players you could sign for midfield could be Tonali, Barella, Tielemans, Llorente For Right Back I’m thinking Davies, Grimaldo, Gaya. I think they could all be a good fit for a rebuild
Barca and United brings big view's
Man he looks like Karan Johar
Bro its not Haaland its Højlund
Sign bellingham
An start with unlimited money an. Buy   The following players Mbappe, Bellingham,sterling,pedri,Gavi, the new guy from Barcelona kid
S2g please start mancity career
Sign Vitinha for Midfield
stop saying hollan or holland or idk what you saying its HOJLUND
Camavinga Yeah, Cama oh, Cama oh, Camavinga
Rasmus Haaland?
Sign Bellingham or gavi
A striker
For midfield i say sign camavinga
16:41
Rodrygo isn't realistic you should've kept garnacho he surely is a great talent
Day 12 of asking S2G to do a Inter 10 cerere mode
S2g is the best career mode channel I've ever watched
Buy a midfielder maybe gavi and don't buy a striker use hojlund as the main starting 9
Check if greenwood is in the game?
Btw Hojlunds name is pronounced like Hoylund
That Rashford header was insane😱
this is nicee
De jong
I think you should keep hojlund as a starter since in real life he was really the main signing and has look promising irl
Day 17 pls do Romelu Lukakus career
YOU SHOULDDD SIGNNNN FRENKIEEEEE DE JONG , AS HE ALMOST WENT TO THE HELL
MARCOS LLORENTE
"Clubs make sensible signings" antony to liverpool💀😂
batoie
You should sign Valverde
RB I think placard would be good he had some links to the club
21:14 There is a bug marked on the scoreboard that both teams with 4 red cards
why would u sell antony, thats so dumb  13:36 S2G misses a 1v1 because he tried to chip: "Maybe i should criticise Mount more, what was that?!"
As A right back I think you should sign Joao Cancelo because he's a very good skillfull and attacking Right back and he's class
You should sign the Maltese cm teddy teuma he's cooking right now in france
Xavi simons
Onana an 85 is too high
Man United are literally known for counter attacking..
As a striker maybe De jong as he was close to signing for United
Do juve after man utd
Go for Oshimen as a striker
Next parttttt
21:14 Why was there like 8 red cards? 😂
I think you should try to sign enzo fernandez for the midfield!
Frenkie De Jong is best replacment for mount
Buy pedri
It has to be de jong for cm because he was linked to united
Day 1 of requesting a Germany national Squad rebuild
for ST  oshimen
S2G>>>TEN HAG
Palcios
It’s pronounced “Hoylund”
Bro kept saying holland😂
Pcq: you should start the Barca career mode very late into the game because that way you can use mods in that series and we want it to be fun
Seth Rogen is that you?!
In terms of transfers coach, i was thinking of upgrading the RB possition with Hakimi, he's got nice traits like whipped pass which improves his quick whipped passes when he overlaps on the flank and quick step which will make him accelerate on first touch and throughout his sprint, next when it comes to the midfield i was thinking someone like Leon Goretzka he has a nice interception trait which helps if we lose possestion to intercept passes and make better challenges, aslo a really strong bruiser trait, very physical player very good with maintaining possesion. Also like i've been talking about it coach make sure to look at the players' strenghts, in order to know how to utilise them better we must know what they are good at aka learn their traits if possible from the game menu
Teun koopmeiners is very good for the cm role
So realistic 😭😭😭
Sign Ronaldo
Get de jong.Hes got a history of him almost joining utd,now that we are in ucl it could be realistic
Sign Szoboszlai from Liverpool to get revenge of signing Antony
15:43 Its Sofyan His brother is nordin
Its HOJLUND NOT HOLAND
One with Liverpool please. They had bad form last season
I think u should bring in Florian Wirtz
Bring Luka Modric or Jude Bellingham
how about you give C.eriksen more game time . He's still a good player
Already love the new series bro keep it up 😁😁
Buy haaland for that attacking position
Why doese ea fc 24 looks kinda bad
Can u pls do a player career mode pls
It would be nice if we got the series on a weekly basis,,maybe 2 times a week if possible because I love your content🔥🔥🔥
I think you should go big on the midfielder, i think you should buy either de Jong or valverde
for cm barella
Rodrygo is a starter😂😂😂
Manu are a counter attacking club that's what they always did since fergy times😂😂😂 0 ball knowledge
Bro 212 million If you are able to you should sign jude bellingham, he will be a long term signing that will maybe last you the whole series
Frankie De Jong would be amazing or Toni Kroos
For a striker position I think we should leave Rasmus as our striker,,It will only take him 1 season and a half to get to a much more acceptable rating
Try buying Camavinga  he will help and he can be a box to box midfielder
Put
PCQ:sign a right back i suggest someone like frimpong or even dumfries
In rb you can sign di Lorenzo
Rice he can play CDM and CM
Make to camera tv wide
How do the player animations look worse and worse each year?
Don’t replace Rasmus hojlund
Now try to not to be indian with terrible accent
Midfielder has to be Foden or de Bruyne if you can
Sid didn’t even play a quick match for his first match and decided to play his first game in manager career.
Great video I’m super jealous
Szoboszlai
I think you should sign Vithina 😉
Musiala
Maybe Araujo for CB
Hello S2G you can get jode Bellegham or pedri or gavi or musiala
Please Sid go get Dusan Vlahovic. No one gets him he is a 84 rated juventus Striker. He turns to a 90 after season 1. Also he’s 6’3”
PCQ: Sign robertone from girona since he is 24. Has a lot of potential.
PCQ I think u should sign frankie de Jong
PCQ: I think with that amount of money. You should buy Frankie De Jong. He can participate in attack with Bruno Fernades and also help Casemiro in defense.
Youve got the money just sign the best RB aleardy i wanna see hakimi in red devils kit
Stat with rasmus . 😀be realistik
Sign Hakimi for RB
Use arago for Rb and cb
In midfield buy either musiala/ odegaard or upgrade eriksen until retirement they are both solid youngsters for the midfield
Do you want get you Cristiano Ronaldo 😊
Sala get him
You should trust in eriksen more then mount
Or mid field Bellingham
I think you should Sign Gavi for CM position Youngster with great potential and more than half time sitting on the bench of Barcelona
CM Gavi because he’s young and because he has the pace
Seeing how mbappe interacts with the club would be sick, especially vs man city. It could also be a realistic transfer if he doesnt go to madrid.
PCQ: you should play rashford at ST and sign a LW and CM or you could play garnacho at LW and go all out on a CM
I think for rb Trent because he is only 24 yrs old
Sign Raphael guerriero and make him a cm plzz shoutout bro
For cm I suggested buy matheo Guendouzi, he can defend and attack in the same time. Plus he's a tanker, I think it will be fit with ur playing style
So the tradition broken goodbye unsub
I think you should get achraf hakimi for your right back position and then change your formation to a 4-4-1-1 and then you could convert Hojlund to a centre forward and once you've done that you could sign randal kolo muani as your striker
Sign Gavi or Pedri
should have kept it realistic and then go for rodrigo or big signings wen we are back on top..non realistic challenge..not close to real life
bro 100% throws these games on purpose
For the midfield option i guess should sign goretzka he is a great choice btw i love ur vids sid❤
Is it same part for ps4?
mitoma or tomiyasu can be a good one , mitoma is so versatile
Make Rashford CF Sign KVARACKHELIA as LW
I think Milinkovic-Savic could be a good option or Gavi cause he is young and he has good potential or Pedri For the same thing
You could sign Trent Alexander Arnold because i feel like if you convert him to a CM he would fit perfectly in the team
I think you should take Bellingham,tchoumeni or Marco reus
i think for st you should sign earling haaland
Valverde he will be the best
I think you should get a LB like Ben Chilwell or Davies 🇨🇦
Haaland
Sing hakimi or frimpong
Haaland as the ST and Modric as CM
Messi
Nicolo Barella would be am amazing signing Sid ❤ the guy is a complete package he can  defend as well attack, pacey for a midfielder, crazy skills a great player all round 👏 👍
Get sewey
Can you please rebuild Brisbane roar please
Covert phil Jones to striker instead of hojlund
You should sign frimpong for rb and camavinga both of them with great potential
Please sign hakimi
The lack of ball knowledge is ridiculous 😂
Disrespectful to forest sid
Cr7😢😢
PCQ : i think you should sign nico barella he is young suit to your play style
Sign Mikhaylo Mudryk 🐐🐐🐐
Bro doesn't know how to play and he's criticizing Mason mount 😂😂
Menu in career mode is trash.and the score line and stop menu is trash too
Gavi
You can sigh Jude bellingham because you also have the money to buy him
I thing you should sign vitinah.he is top potential
My opinion is you should sign Pedri or musiala
Messi
Dont be such a f*cking p*ssy man the only reason you want to sell Antony is because he is facing allegations with his ex girlfriend. He has said many times he has not done it and even went out of his way to say he will get all the evidence he needs to prove he is not guilty its literally like the Depp Heard case where the female looks to be framing the male. He has even posted secret WhatsApp chats on his ig that proves he was being friendly and trying to communicate with her in the best possible way. I think you're big enough to make your own decisions because alot of people seem to be supporting Antony too. Next time do things which you think are right. Just because the fans or people watching you are going to think of you negatively just because you want to keep Antony then you want to sell him? C'mon be mature man.
You should sign frenkie de Jong heavily linked with united and he is the perfect fit😁
barella for midfield or frenkie de jong
martinalli
Sign a realistic transfer man
sign camavinga or barella
Szobo would be nice
I think you should sign a right back and I think Reece James since he’s young and he’s from Chelsea 😊
Don’t sell Hojlund he’s so good he just scored against Bayern instead buy someone like Kudus because Ten Hag wanted him and coached him at Ajax and is really creative also he can play on the wings or cf in a false 9 or just use Ambrabat.
Next should be Barça
bro the gameplay is so sus in this
you pronounce hojland as hoyland not holland
Midfielder
PCQ: sign arder güler
splash the cash get big singings
Or camavinga
Bro plz sign De Paul fron atletico who agrees
You should get latauro Martinez because he has got the Brazilian link up with rodrygo
Make a Barca career mode
Sign Ronaldo back or sign mbappé or Haaland
Change it too ultimate
Kevin De Bruyne
Odegard or de jong
Sold Antony which is the main man for ten hag on that rw spot. Why can’t you be a bit realistic and make fun to watch? Signing rodrygo? Seriously?😂
whats with these glitches💀
SING MAGUIRE
for the midfield role i think you can trust amrabat and also if you want to sign new player you can sign gavi because after gundagon came to barcelona he dosen't have much game time
U always mess up Hojlund's name. It's H-O-I-L-U-N-D
Modric Hojgberg
I think for striker you should sign immobile because he's 85 rated and 33 years old.perfect for a couple of seasons and højlund will grow till then
you can maybe sign de ligt as a promising youngster that can be a club legend
Sign a midfielder like james Maddison
Rasmos holland😭😭
Please use couch cam next videos
Sign Victor Osimhen 💪
Sign rodrigo DE Paul
Get De Gea in as GK coach 😂  he can teach Onana how to shot stop haha instead of concede 14 goals in 5 games
For the CM position I feel like Bruno Guimaraes would be a good fit
Sign aubameyang
I think Jude Belling ham would be a good signing, like you have about 200 million and you can swap deal mason mount too.  In right back you should sign Frimpong, he is pretty good.
Sign barrella and frimpong
Pls buy maryon boadu & doku
Sell onana
Sign Eze
Banger epi bro i think Cherki for the midfield maybe or Seiwald
sign De Gea
You should give garnacho more chances. Your future is safe he is is there with you. Love the vids
you should sign Martin Baturina he is 20 years old 74 rated and has high potenital.Martin Baturina also has played in the champions league,europa league and the conference league
Against Nottingham forest I saw 3 reds on your side and 3 reds on the other side🤣🤣
Sign oshimen
KEEEEEPPPPPP HOJLUND KEEEEEPPPPPP MOUNT
Can you change kits at the end of the season
I think mason mount is good so give him a chance
I think you should sign Eduardo Camavinga for Real Madrid or Nico Rovella from Juventus ( Rovella has potential up to 86 and will be good investment for the future
I think signing Pedri is a great option because you have the money for it and with his creative and stamina it bring a lot of energy in the midfield.   By the way, appreciate the hard work sid
For CM position I think u can use Valverde 😉
Do not sell mount
for the midfielder you should try gavi
I think u should sign a box to box midfielder so frenkie de jong would be perfect
Play 4-3-3 with cdm and try to assign this squad,and please give them these numbers Cheers!  Gk-Onana(1) Lb-Shaw(2) Cb-Martinez(4) Cb-Varane(3) Rb-Hakimi(5) Cdm-Casemiro(6) Cm-Bruno Fernandes(7) Cm-De Jong(8) Lw-Rashford(10) St-Hojlund(9) Rw-Rodrygo(11)
I think for cm go for valverde and rb of course frimpong 100%
I felt genuine pain when he replaced Erikson with mount
Bro sign mo. Salah for the strike he will help u alot
I think u must include amrabat in the starting lineup instead of buying new midfielders, we all what amrabat can do and he’s defensively really strong, he can match up with Casemiro to help as a deep lying playmaker.
can u create s2g fc back again in fc 24
I think you should bring Carlos Soler in the midfield position, hes a great player for this team and he has lots of potentiol
make juli alva or pulisic as a cm for mount or rice or Trent CDM
Enze hernandez
Sign De Jong plz... It makes more sense as he was always on the verge of signing man utd
RB -  Wan Bissaka isn't good enough. I would reccomend Frimpong or Noussair Mazraoui as they both have the legs to run and would be a great addition to the team
Pls sign kimmich
Pls sign kimmich
Pls sign kimmich
De jong
Pls 🙏🥺 next part
S2G please give No.7 to Garnacho.
I think gavi will be a solid option
Go for de jong
PCQ: According to me Nicolo Barella or Pedri or Alexis Macalister from Liverpool as they signed Antony from you will be great options for you for midfield. And the backup striker for hojlund can be Kolo Muani or Victor Osimhen as in reality also they wanted to sign one of them but failed. And as a right back you can sign Jeremy Frimpong in whom man united was interested a lot.
What's going on with the shadows
buy the best midfielder in the world Jud BellingHIM
Sign leon goretzka for cm role and switch to a 4-2-3-1 because ten hag is using it
sign neymar plz
jude belingham
use amrabat more instead of mount
Sign hakimi and mbappe
Damn, I wanted to see you not buy anyone for the first season to be more realistic
Who’s Norman Amrabat Sid😂.
You should sign frenkie De Jong or Nicolo Barella
sign victor osimhen or alexander isaak
Sign a new goalie or play bayindir because Onana has been bad
Haaland
Need to sign a good GK in real life and FC24 too
Since you've got the money why not sign jude Bellingham from real madrid. That would be so funny
the midfield problem : eriksen, bruno fernandes and mason mount all are attacking midfielders while caseimero is an old cdm...u need to find a proper anchor man or a proper number 8 to hold the ball in midfield and a new cdm young talent to replace caseimero in future seasons forward : A veteran CF with good aerial abilities is suitable...this way hojlund will also get game time but once his rating goes up( he must be sold for money)...he does not really fit the legacy of man utd
bro at nottingahm forest match i just 4 red cards for both teams
I think for the cm you can sign dominik szoboszlai
i think voctor osimhen will be a good signing
It’s finally here
For cm u could sign tonali
Pcq sign reece james for rb it would be great
Pcq: I think for cm someone like kimmich as he would help out defensively
For a striker you should sign the Mexican striker Santiago Giménez, i always used him in fifa 23 and he’s a baller. Trust me, hes crazy good. Could be the next Chicharito
Sign osimhen for the striker position and barella,aouar,loftus-cheek either one of them for the CM position
I think u should sign kai havertz or camavinga cause he can player everywhere for exm gk st rw lw cm cam cdm rb lb cb 😂
Kane
PCQ: Sign a box-to-box midfielder like Ruben Neves or Adrien Rabiot
Was actually looking forward to the Barca save. Man Utd is unsaveable😂😂😂
for the striker position sign RICHARLISON from tottenham, he has being playing terrible until the game against sheffield united!!!
Anyone interested in UEFA Fantasy where you can create your own team based in real life players performance,i want to create a group for that,plz shout out if u interested
You should have bought dembele for the RW position
You can Isak
tbh seems like u should sign frenkie de jong or martin odegard
Sign MBAPPE
I think you need to replace mount with maybe camavinga?
sign Havertz to play him Mount 🤣🤣
Use reguilon more often  He is better than shaw  For midfielder marcel sabitzer or felix nmecha can be a good addition to the team
Hi S2G big fan, My opinion is don't sell Mason Mount because he can be an X factor for you in the important matches and also he contains a good amount of potential so you should trust on him and give him chances .
sign diomonde and de jong
We wanted the traditional Barcelona Career Mode as the first one.😑😑
With these grapics i can act like im watching a football game infront of my father while im actually playing XD
the midfielder u should sign is gravenberch (idk if i spelled his name wrong)  he is good and will fit in the tactical vision
how about getting veratti cauze it makes sense he a cm but a good cdm and  mount is only 81 ovr and veratti is like a 84 or 85 ovr
ronaldo
For the midfield I recommend you sign Jude Bellingham because he is unstoppable for Madrid or Sign Gortezka because he is a proper box to box midfielder Love from India❤
For midfield Bellingham ❤ For rb frimpong
i think you should try frenkie de jong in the midfield as he can help to support Casemiro a lot and can be very useful to build up plays and attack
Rasmus hojlund not a real face ? 😢
pov- 15:43- bro you just spoke nordin amrabat. it's sofyan amrabat. you just spoke sofyan amrabat's elder brother
Hey Sid i have an idea for a midfield position you should sign Valverde from Real Madrid
Eafc looks and feels so good  When I mean feels I mean watching you play and when there is a goal the crowd  celebrates so much and its just amazing
Love your content Sid. For the midfield position since you have cash you could go for Bellingham or Enzo or even gavi
Don’t buy a striker, just use Højlund and let him grow
You should sign De Jong, since there is lots of rumors about him joining Man United.
Bellingham
I think you should get jeremie frimpong because he is a dalot replacement and he fits in with the wing play because he has 94 pace
CR7 and Jude
We live we love we lie😢
Rodrygo has been a starter for madrid since last season though  Not a bench player
PCQ : you have to sign musiala
For right back, you should go with Sacha Boey. Super young with a high potential. Plus he scored in the champions league last night!
Bring in Bryan Cristante
I think for the midfielder signing you should sign Nicolo barella from inter because his stats are insane and he will help the team
Don't replace Højlund. Turn him into a club legend!
I think Frenkie De Jong or Leon Goretzka and I recommend a RB Araújo or stick with Dalot
Sign dembele
Hey Sid how about for midfield u sign a more box to box midfielder like Camavinga or Caicedo and let Bruno focus on just attacking
Can’t wait for the barça rebuild 😅
You definently need a new RB plus a CM but i think you should sign a ST who will be there for a season or two until Højlund turns into a player capable of starting
I would love either Mbappé or Vini (A speedy player)
Get back pogba
Buy CR 7
Rodrygo comes off the bench 💀💀💀
I think you should by Mario icardi as he will act like a back up striker n if rasmus is injured you can you icardi also he will also act as a false 9  Please read this big man
I think u should bench mount and start eriksen if it does not work then consider signing de jong or barella.
Sid can u sigh Rusu?He's a defender that is 85 rated.(ok he's from fifa 22)
Pcq: I think you should try out Amrabat, as he can help on defense
sign Antonio silva from Benfica next best cb
Hey Sidd, I think you should sign a midfielder like vitinha or goretzka!
Splash all the cash on de jong sell Erikson to Saudi Arabia
i think you can steal kdb from man city i think that will trigger city fans
Hoilund! Not hoiland. Love the video, But u have to say it right. Love from Denmark
I can't wait to play this game
acting like antony is guilty🤦‍♂️ he has shown proof and cooperated with brazilian police the truth will come out soon❤️
the game looks so bad lol
acting like antony is guilty🤦‍♂️ he has shown proof and cooperated with brazilian police the truth will come out soon❤️
Kylian Mbappé
Midfielder, Frenzied de Jong
for midfielders you could try and sign Renato Sanches from PSG or Frenkie De Jong.
Don't sign a Mid- you have Amrabat
Buy vangilis pavlides fron az alkmaar
I think you should put amrabat as a starter and put mount on the bench sid and sign regulon
Sign de Jong for the midfielder role as he is good defensively also
make a carrer with PAOK
sign nicollo barella for midfield
Jude Bellingham will be very good one
camavinga is the perfect CM u need he is defensive as well as creative and u can do with a better Rb like frimpong he is got the potential and is like a man united signing
I feel like you should try and sign gavi or caicedo young and have the potential
Sid you got the money so my opinion is to bring in future star jude Bellingham if this happens you can even steal arda guller from real madrid bcz he is gonna grow like hell man
That is the demo not the actual game😂
Sign teó Hernandez from ac milan he's high rated 26 yrld and sign a English cb from crystal palace he has high potential he's full potential is 88 and use verane as super sub!
Why don’t you sign Martin Ødegaard ?
Ronaldo
Pcq:Sign a CDM and play Two CDM’s with Bruno cam put development plan for Bruno’s pace
Sign camavinga
Sign frenkie de jong
Get rid of onana and sign ramsdale from arsenal
Sign DE  jong
Hey sid I think you should sign Giorgio scalvini from bergamo calcio he's a good young centre back for the future
I think you should sign Mehdi Taremu
U can sign Victor oshimen for st, that's make sense 🎉
Pcq: For the CM position I would reccommend Ryan Gravenberch or Frenkie De jong. Also playing Mount as a CAM instead of CM
Why are you replacing  garnacho and Højlund they are under rated 🤬🤬
First of all u should have started the season with transfer window off  Second during the winter window make realistic signings considering our pathetic board and management. You guys show things are very easy for being  Manchester united manager
Sighn cancello for RB or Leon goretzka for cm
Buy Frimpong he  is a really good rightback
Anyone here after Man Utd lost to Bayern?
Day 2 of asking for a Bristol City 10 seasons👍
Frenkie De Jong would be the perfect midfielder for Man Utd plus he was linked with United before. He can both be an 8 they need and a defensive midfielder to support Casemiro. Btw keep up the good work!
nunez
De jong
For the midfield you can try Vitinha from PSG good work rates and not totally unforseeable
For strike sign oshimen as it was rumoured
cancelo
4-3 Bayern 😢
Can u please do it with Liverpool
Don't sign a striker We want to see Rasmus hojuland Develop under the world greatest manager And become one of the best players of the world
17 hour gang loveing the seris from day1
I think for the midfield area guler. He may be young but he has great dynamic potential.And if u want a rb go for.malo gusto
For the wingplay style, the most suited midfielders for Man United will be Leon Goretzka or Frenkie De Jong, as you need to have a proper Box-to-Box midfielder to create chances, join the attack and track back for counter-attacks
ST
First video of EA FC 24 guys!  I hope Sid can create more bangers on EA FC!
Get Ivan Toney, he's not too much of a star and can be rotated with Hojlund allowing him play time and the ability to learn from Toney and reach hes full Potential
Sidihno from Germany pls (start at hamburg) love your vids
Sign brand for  your next video
Goretzka or Barella for midfield
Sidinho from Italy pls love your videos sid
Sid I think you should sign the Turkish Messi Adra Guler
You don't sell psn codes on your shop
Victor Osi!!
Hey S2G  I suggest that you should buy back Ronaldo or Benzema so that Rasmus can play and grow  For CM you should sign Gavi or   Frattesi , another option is to change your midfield to 2 CAM and 1 CDM
I think you should give mount a chance the hate towards him is crazy
u have a lot of money, get valverde as your midfieilder, he is an all round player
Pedri should be signed he is young and could become a potential superstar in the latter stages of the career mode
Sid, I think you should start to involve the youth academy because in real life Man Utd have brought Garnacho and Rashford from there so you could make some wonder kids!
You should be signing Marcos Llorente as he is a great CM and can also play RB
Onana from everton
Add gavi and balde to your team
PCQ: You should sign enzo fernandez, hes 83 rated 21 years old good through passes could play the wingers in perfect for the team
Only Sid can save this trash club 😂
You should sign David raya from arsenal for back up
Do a new Nottingham Forest career mode
can you buy Gnabry from Bayern
I think u should get Trent alexander Arnold for RB Bcz wan bissaka is not that capable.....
Maybe Xavi Simon's
Sell eriksen  Sign enzo Fernandez  He is not getting what he deserves in Chelsea this might be a realistic move
Try to get arda güler for the bench
i think you shoud sing valverde
Pcq:-Someone like Valverde,camawinga for low price and pedri for high price considering Bellingham is new to Madrid and should grow there first
Me who following s2g since day knowing he dint follow the traditional way which managing barca 😔🙃
Sign Valverde , Gabi Verga or Gordan from Newcastle and also sign Enzo Fernandez these players are quality midfielders and for CB sign Ramos and Thiago Silver
Striker position I think vlahovic would be great  You don't sign him in a random basis, Also he is a versatile player  And he is not in a good position in Juventus ,this is realistic
Heyyy Sid sign Frankie de jong
Take  gavi
Gåvi
Neymar jr
i think you need to get another midfielder mate that should sort the team
I Think A midfielder could be someone like Federico Valverde ps love your videos😊
Jude beligham
Eriksen
Can you do a Tottenham career mode Next please😄😄😄
But goretza for midfield and also replace your right back for cancelo
Sign Trent from Liv in response to Antony 😂 that would be class
Mac allister👇
Don't you think you are bit pale in your avatar manager? 😅 Nice video bro ❤ Your content is very entertaining and enjoyable
Pls arsenal      .💬💬💬💬  💬🐷🐷🐷💬 💬   plsss    💬     💬💬💬💬 ........😳 ........🙏 ....... 👖 ......👟👟
Make safayan amrabat a permanent transfer he is on loan and has loads of potential
PCQ: sign julian alvarez because he is not starting much over haaland
I think you should sign Jamal musiala very talented and good stats
I think for a back up centre back you should sign Romero he’s a World Cup winner and he has very good premier league experience
Oshimhen ST
Keep Højlund
Oshimhen ST
Oshimhen ST
Sign Kimmich or Camavinga in midfield
Hakimi for RB Goreztka for CM Maybe Osihmen ST sorry can’t spell his name
I think F.Valverde will be a good fit in mid.More over you haven't used him much
Can u sing vini jr
Sign Paul Pogba back and retrieve his carrer man, and i think you need a better RB go for FRIMPONG
PCQ:sid you should sign Julian alvarez from your rivals city hes a good striker performs well and can play in multiple positions also hes being benched at city he will get game time at united.
Gavi  please 😢
bring frenkie de jong to man utd, cuz why not he really good in barca
Sign Brandt
Pcq: You can sign GAVI or Pedri they are young and they are good
juliian alvarez great young striker
Haaland and kdb and real  Madrid Gk
Looks cool
Get griezmann hhes old but will provide quality for some years
Oh my days EAFC put No effort into game faces Rasmus Hoijlund looks absolutely atrocious…
cm should be brahim diaz since he has that playmaker role in him and the rb could be carvajal or eder militao since both have chemistry with casemiro and are very expirienced
Bro you can sign harry kane
load on cash 😂. Have you seen the debts that we are in 😂
I am a united fan and this does not seem realistic. Rodrygo from Real madrid... its a joke right😂. And selling pellistri and mainoo wow. You need to do some research!!!
To ensure there are now shadow issues, try playing in overcast or night games. You can change this in settings before starting a match.
Sign valverde
I think u should sign younger midfielder player like Bellingham, Pedri, Gavi, Camavinga, Valverde and Rice
You can sign ronaldo(as a fan) but seriously you should sign Bellingham and even camavinga
What does a man has to do win a free copy of fifa Sid 😔
Good striker would be Martinez from inter
You are so lucky you can get eafc24 but absolutely I am broke😢😢
PCQ: You can sign an experienced ST like Immobile and develop Rasmus for the future. Also for the CM, you can go for a Box-to-Box midfielder like Guendouzi.
Amrebut
sign bernardo silva
Please do Real Madrid next. Love your vids man.
I think u should replace mount and sell antony
Create your own club in ea FC 24
Barella 23 🔥
Bring mason greenwood back from loan and use him as a striker
U should have started with barça bro
Maybe play 4231, with ambrabat and Casemiro at cam, and the rest of the team as it is
L Martinez
ticki taka is kina how man u play.
Ronaldo
No 🧢 the ad before this video was an FC24 ad
Sign bennacer or de jong
Am exited
For CM sign Kimmich, helps in defense but great in transition and attack
Pedri or Bellingham for cm
The Rodrygo Transfer was very unrealistic
Can’t believe they left wan bissaka at an 80, he’s been crazy for United
You can sign calhanoglu and rewind his career.  He is actually pretty good
For the midfied frenkie de jong is a good choice. He has been linked with utd for the past summer transfers. Moreover,with bruno a more of attack minded and casemiro a defensive minded player.frenkie would probably perfected their midfield..since,he is more of a conductor or playmaker who could control the pace of the game
Jude Bellingham,Enzo Fernández, Jamal Musiala
Lloris is not in totenham
CM: barella / De jong RB: Hakimi
you should sign frenkie de jong. u have the budget and he was rumoured to sign for manu in real life as well
for the midfield you should get either verrati or de jong and in the striker position david or jota
PCQ sign gavi he’s young and he has the mentality of winning plus his stats are crazy this year
goretzka, he is underrated
I think you go with muisiala
Get a new goal keeper please
fc24 is literally a better version of the manager23 sega mobile... or technically fifa23 + manager23 sega mobile
sid, you could try a formation with two cdm's then you can involve amrbat and casemiro in the team and it will also support you tactical vision
Go for valverde
You should sing frimpong for rb and barella for cm . A reccomandation for a st is moukoko he is young but he is probably going to be around 60million.
maybe you can get bellingham in fir the cm position
Try using 4213 with ambrabat , and please keep the signings realistic. Keep rasmus and let martial leave then sign Evan Ferguson from Brighton
Hey S2G, you should try de jong or camavinga for the midfield, maybe even pedri or gavi too
Sign oliver giroud he wiil give the time for hojlund to grow
Sign upamecano
Sign pedri he is class 👏 btw hes going to punch you budget
For the midfield bring in Lucas Diaz from Sporting and Jamal Musiala. That can bring you a better chance creator for Hojlund and Rodrygo with Rashford
Bring Ronaldo back!!!
I think you should start player career
Kolo muani and gavi
Pcq:- You should sign Frenkie de Jong as Man United were linked to him for a long time
Who else other than Jude
i think you gonna buy at midfielder is bellingham or goretzka
Osimhen and de Jong please you are my favorite fifa YouTuber and the new EAfc 24 looks so good!!! I’m interested to see where this series goes!!!!
I think u should use Gavi because he is young so he will keep growing
Sign Kimmich from bayern
I say go all out with the midfield and go for someone young like Enzo or gavi
Frimpong would be great for that RB spot
aye you should get psg loan back up striker hugeo exotica i think @S2G
Sid violating united at every turn 😂💔
I think you should sign someone like Leon Goretzka or Nicolo Barella. Love the content by the way.
How about Jude Bellingham he’s going to make a last-minute goal for real Madrid I don’t know what’s his value but let’s check he’s gonna do so good for you
Maybe someone like szobozlai could work and u could give him some freedom in a right cam role
Roni
Same cutscenes
Love the vid Sid and it’s day 7 of asking u to help the Philadelphia Union win the UCL Edit: anyone else see the eight red cards ??? (21:17)
Bro I think it so obvious GO FOR PEDRI
Ismael Bennacer as a midfielder!!
Change rodrygo’s no. 13 looks so weird on him
are you able to bring greenwood back from loan?
You should sign livarmonte
Cm is Barella
Hi
I think you should sign Frankie De Jong for the midfield
I wish I could afford eafc24
Sign jobe bellingham from Sunderland and make him as good if not better then his brother (club legend)
S2g has fallen off, why is rodrygo wearing number 13 and why are you playing so unrealistic
Sign oscar glugh
I think Bennacer is perfect because he has defending and can help Casemiro and he can still bag some goals in.
Resign Mason Greenwood!!!
You should get Frankie de jong
The defense sucks but I like the attack if you keep going with the attack but never just buy one center back buy 2
Mason greenwood
Sign lautaro martinez
You should include the Glazers to make it more of a challenge
Cristiano Ronaldo
Bring in Kevin de bryune he kept his 91 rating for a long time
Sign Julian Alvarez because it makes sense he doesn’t get that much playing time he is a really good striker.
De Jong
For midfield but Frankie de jong, he can play key passes in attack and he can help your defense
Shouldn’t do United 🤮 do Liverpool at some point
Not buying it this year. Bought the last one and only played for 2months. Money not well spent on my part.
Like kimich or valverde
I suggest Frenkie de Jong as a cm, he's been linked to man utd a couple times and he can help out Casemiro in the midfield for defence
Try signing Marco veratti for the midfield.  A midfield of Casemiro veratti and bruno fernandes
For ST i suggest gabrel jesus because u used him before and he will link up with casemiro and rodrygo
please change rodrygo number
Pcq: you should sign llorente as as a midfielder he can play right back if your tight back gets injured has pretty good potential he would be a realistic signing for man utd
For CB i suggest eder militao because he will link up with rodrygo and valverde
pcq: one of the main reasons why your losing games is because your not using the tactics correctly. Your wingers are good but your full backs are not overlapping that much because they just don´t have the pace. If I were you I would get Destine Udogie  from Tottenham because he is pacey, has excellent dribbling for a full back, versatile, young, and I´ve watched you for long enough and you play better with fulbacks like udogie.
I suggest federico valverde bucause u allready have rodrygo so valverde will link with him well (im a big fan)
Messiiiii
Can you do bayern leverkussen or aston villa and sign xavi simons, elanga ,lewis, maatsen , bamba and nico williams
If only Rodrygo is in MU irl 😢 at least this make my day 😢
Sergino dest would be crazy at right back.
Vlahovich you should sighn for the striker position
Messi and Ronaldo 🐐 🐐
Mbappé
Messi
You should sign Alexander Isak because hojlund is too low rated so you should send him on loan
Hey sid In my opinion the new player u should sign is matin odegaard.  He is young and will have an existing combo with Bruno  Can u make that happen plz
Thank you so much you made my day  after seeing a 4 3 loss against bayern ❤ can you play as garnacho in fc24 🙏
Bellingham
You shouldn't sign a striker seems the wrong decision when Hoijlund as only just signed same with Mason Mount so I would go for a Right Back and a Center Back as Maguire needs to be out.
Keep Hojlund just give him time
Play a 4-2-3-1 with amrabat and casemiro as your cdms
Sign dusan vlahovic he’s a young and high rated striker
No Barcelona?? 😢😢
de gea
I hope Manchester and Chelsea battle for relegation, we need new teams in the premier league
I think you should sign Tielemans from leister, he is only 26 and cheap. Also he is 83 rated and suitable for the team
I think for the CM position a realistic one frenkie de jong man united have been tryna sign him for 2 years so yeah de jong and if you want an ST lautaru martinez is a good shout and if you need an RB then i think geertuida and frimpong are the best options here
It looks like ea fc finally make sid cool down on the scripting😂
For the cm position I would recommend wirtz he’s exceptional
Mid field Kai Havertz
For cm I think you should sign pedri or kdb for the experience and for the striker if haaland is in your budget sign him
You should sing Federico Valverde from Real Madrid
pcq: give hojlund a shot cuz he’s a physical monster. i would focus on signing a right back and developing players like tyrell malacia. and a young backup center back as varane is getting old and will start dropping in a couple of seasons. keep mount as a backup cam, and sign a box to box midfielder such as lovro majer from wolfsburg, he’s balling out in the bundesliga rn. mount and dalot and the majority of this team are still young. maybe sign some experienced players to help the team out
since you're not signing a striker...use the majority of the money tp sign pedri or de jong
21:22 to 21:29 be like “ OH NO HEEEs dOnE the GriDDdy oN mE “
Day 1 of asking sid to buy Cristian Medina
SID..try signing palhinia
I think Modric or Kroos would be interesting. They are cheap & they can be great captains. Maybe you can bring in Kante for cheap.
i need help, i am playing with leicester city, i got them in a comfortable 3rd place, which guarantees us champions league, the problem? i got real in my group
sign dembele
Let’s asses the squad let’s look at our great players  Me: they don’t have any  I am a Liverpool fan so
you should sign santiago gimenez as a striker as he is tearing up the dutch league and he is actually linked to chelsea in real life
Siu
Striker OSIMHEN
Marco verrratii 😂😂
PCQ:sid you should sign bernado silva from city as he is a great playmaker and you can make him a box to box midfielder , plus it also weakens man city's squad and increase your chance of winning pl
I absolutely hate man united but it is an s2g career mode I have to watch😂
Can you buy Trent for RB pls Sid
How do u get the cd early
Those shadows need to be fixed asap
Rasmus Holland?
I would love to see Jude Bellingham get signed but think he’s a little too expensive. But, He would be a decent support player for the cdm and maybe the striker.
Not Antony
Or signing mudryk is okay because of his pace
I feel signing enzo fernandez can make a boost to replace mason mount because of his spped and dribbling
Sid get camavinga he can play anywhere
Sign Bernardo in rm ------>
Try And Realistically Sign Xavi Simons To Replace Mount🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Bellingham
PCQ: sign Frenkie de jong or maybe Valvelrde for CM postion
Sign Malik Thiaw for center back depth😊
Goofy manager unites
The new era has started
Where are oficial scoreboard of Premier League?
maybe  kimmich to help for midfield defensively wise
Have you ever thought of De Jong, he is a great midfielder and the deal is realistic
His name is Rasmus HOJlund .. freaking Holland man..
Ronaldo
the perfect signing would be frenkie de jong. a cheap alternative is goretzka
sign bellingham
Mohammed kudus
Pls buy Joao Felix I beg he's class if u try him but if nit it's OK but at least think about it and for the midfielder buy CAMAVINGA no like seriously
It would've been better to turn off the first transfer window, makes it more realistic instead of signing players like Rodrygo, who United are in no position to sign irl. But for that cm position I reckon you should trust Erikson.
De bryuen
Valverde for CM
Since man United have a humongous budget, I think you would be able to pull off Jude Bellingham
Do a long Barcelona Manager Career Mode Please
PCQ: why did you loan out kobbie, he could have been a really good project to work on
Adding a world class midfielder would be good, but I also think you need to look at right back. AWB is quite lacking in quality.
Sign frimpong, he’s been rumored to join United, also gavi if you want a fuck it signing, otherwise sign Guerrero as if you turn him to a cm he becomes a 88, also use development plans on everyone, if hojlund gets injured, use rashford at striker, and garnacho at lw
Need depth in the winger positions. Sign free agent Eden Hazard. Revive his career please.
I think you have to sign rodri
Sign gavi for midfield and adeyemi for ST
David neres is a good attacker also he cald ten hag an🥚
Get Cristiano Ronaldo SIUUUUU
I think that have some players to the midfield but Pedri, Barella and Frenkie de jong I think Its more realistic
Sid sign wilfred ndidi he is good offensivley and defencively in midfield
Day 23 of asking to fix Richmond
you should sign pedri for cm
Sign Tchuameni or camavinga as the backup to Cacemiro👍🏼
You should sign Merino. he has a lot of potential rated 84 and his stats are amazing. His defending is at a 83 with only one of them under 80. His passing is also really good and so is his physicality. He can go forward, but also go back with a great work rate back and forwards. His weak food is a bit bad though, but still a 3 start weak foot. I think this will be a great signing for your team.😊😊
You could also go with Camamvinga for the MIDFIELD. He's got a good weak foot, pace and industry, good awareness and he can fill in for almost every position!😃
PCQ: sign frenkie de jong for the cm position
I think you should sign a midfielder that can help out both the defense and the attack so you will win games
I have a lot of hope in hojlund , keep him!
Bro said utd aren’t a counter attacking team
Sign Jude Bellingham
Sign Julian Alvarez since he’s young and a really good player in Haalands shadow
You should sign Dybala
It feels strange to see Sid not do a Barcelona career mode as first career of the game...
you need to sign Musiala, he’s fast on the ball and could really improve the man united team
You should sign Hakimi for your RB
Make Jobe Belinghamm better than his brother Jude, MAKE HIM A MAN PLAYER!!!!
Gonçalo Ramos
21:16, yall got 4 players sent of each? xD
For cm you should get  Lucas Paqueta you should also get Pedri our gavi
Fc 24 is shitttt and fast gameplay and still broken defense
Master 2G, I think leon goretzka would be great and maybe you could use eriksen in a swap deal so that you have more cash to sign someone else
Go with KDB for the midfielder cause he is elegant and can score many goals!😃😃
Do Barcelona next
Get De jong or just play Amrabat more
Hey sid,I love the content and you should keep it up,but I think that you should give barella a chance
Bro you are good  l can play professional  only
Need a back up striker like maybe awiyoni
You need to sign a RB
Maybe gavi
Wtf is the stdaium why tf is the shadow soo bad and the lighting is way too much if u in the shadow
De gea back
The manager actually looks a lot like me 😂
Sign kimmich? from bayern
oshimen or leao :)
Holand💀💀
♥️
I got my i wll be able to play on friday
pcq: sign bennacer from ac Milan, he's rock solid..very hard to take off the ball, can okay some really nice long passes for the wingers and even up top for the striker and most importantly, he can serve as a good cover for an ageing casemiro
I am get my soon i wll be able to play ths friday
Game look ass bredda
It is the same fixtures
Sign Barella from Inter Milan
Oscar Højlund from fc copenhagen a real talent
sign Trent alexander arnold
For the midfield I think you should sign   bellingham because he is cheap and very good :))))
Pcq: I think Frenkie De Jong would be great as he was linked with United last year, or maybe Leon Goretzka would also be an option.
KEEP HOJLUNDDDDD
Make Højlund number 9 and Rodrygo number 11
This is a sugestion about not selling to rivals to add a bit more realism
PcQ:you should sign gavi
I love you Sid
Signing frenkie de jong would be a good and realistic idea since man united have been trying to sign him for the past 2 seasons , he is the best choice
I think you should get tino Wener because he's op on fc 24 and you'll get him for around 30mill
Valverde because he has good stats and is 88 rated
Hey Sid, Why not sign a youngster like Gavi. Pedri is the main young golden boy for Barcelona, Gavi is always on the bench, he is world class and probably not that expensive. A signing for the future for sure.
i think u should sign gavi he is fast and gives support and gives his all for ur cm position. and for ur Rb spot u should get di lorenzo u dont really get him in ur past career modes and i think he fits man united playstyle.
What about Rodrigo De Paul or Federico Valverde? Something different!
For the midfield role you can sign camavinga ,  pedri or bellingham
Sign Cho Young Wook, He's a young Korean Striker in the Korean Leauge and has decent potential
Sign Patrick shik
Palinha from fulham
Liverpool would never buy Anthony irl 💀
AYYY
Are you fuсking mоrons?!?! Are you really going to buy a FIFA 23 patch for full price?! I'd rather wait 1-2 days after the release and download it from a torrent. Fifa 23 got hacked so don't buy this crap and wait for it to get hacked.
Those shadows do crazy
I recommend keeping hojlund for the striker position
I would advise a well rounded midfielder someone to play through the ball like barella and an experienced striker that can last for a few seasons like Moreno or aspas
you should sign new fullbacks and develop young players and also focus on youth scouts and youth academy
I would say barella or Renato sanches
Buy mbappe
same old random goal celebration 😝
How about getting a midfielder in Jamal musiala or jude Bellingham
Pcq : Give Amrabat throughout the season, so when Casemiro gets old, you already have a good replacement.
For the midfield position I think you can sign Pablo Gavi. He has a lot of potential and is a good player
heres waht you do. sell martial and holjund to psg and then buy mbappe and buy critsiano as a back up striker for cheap and get ronaldo one last UCL with united
You should swap onana with Courtois
Sign jessi lingard because I think he is to make a difference for the club
Midfielder I say odegaard he is better faster and shooting is great
Sign Goretzka for CM hes so amazing and sign Walker for RB together they should be worth 100Mil
I think for the cm position you should sign gavi. He is perfect for what you need.
Master s2g I think you should sign Ryan gravenberch I know he just signed for Liverpool BUT  he is an amazing midfielder and I think he will fit in
Rodrygo ain't realistic whatsoever 😂😂
This is everyone’s frost FC 24 career mode video.
Sid will you be posting everyday? If you are I will always be watching the man united ea fc 24 series❤❤❤❤
Barella
You should sign köcku for the midfield
leave mout  he is really good at free kicks and passing,but move Bruno to CM and mount  to cam
What do you play on? If it’s pc imma be so happy
You need RB
You should sign harry Kane as a new striker! Make it happen like it almost did in real life.
My boss sid himself ea FC 24 yesssss
For the workrate and creativity it has to be bellingham, helping with control and creativity
Sid how did u accesses EAFC 24?
You should sign Musiala cause he can Attack and that is the main thing you need to work on
Rodrigo de paul, a waarior needed in the mid 💥
Honestly you should get Jude bellinham he is insane this season
use eriksen instead of mount, get goretzka
for me the best cm you can get is either Pedri or De jong because of how creative they are and how they can control the game
Please, Buy zlatan or lakaka 😂
Just make episode 2 now!😭
Pcq: i think problem is in LB RB you should sign Balde i think
For cm I would say buy de jong I didn't happen in real life but you could make it happen
you should sign Farcundo Farias to help Hojland uptop!! He has high potential and very pacey
It's giving fifa 15 pc vibez
midfielder you have to choose Alexis McAlister
Cm Valverde Rb Frimbong
You should sign Alverez he’s really really good and a youngster that has high potential I think that would be a good deal
Bro lost his first game and is blaming mount💀
Joe willok
Brozovic for mid ?
Not even out yet
Valverde in the midfield
United lost again to bayern😂
James Madison would be a good signing he has experience in the premier league and would be a good play maker
I think you should switch to a 4-2-4 formation and buy another striker so hojilund can have help next to him while he plays
i don"t have
pcq : try loaning talents like simons and try vlahovic
You a fraud for not doing Barca Career Mode first.
FC 24 IS OUT I DIDNT KNOW?
Please make Pellistri one of the best wingers itw!!
Sign valverde he has no stats under 80
Osihmen has to be the choice !!!! Big love from argentina ❤
Pcq: You should totally sign Luka Modric, I know he’s old but he’s still great and can preform amazingly even as a player of his age. (plus he needs a change from Madrid)
sign Vlahovic to prove u read ur comments just joking don't have to buy him
lol you wish, his name is not Rasmus Haaland XD
Maaaan…..I wish I had the money to buy it 😞
You chaud get BELLINGHAM
I think Nicolo Barela is the kind of player you need, because Bruno needs a player who's at the level as him, forget about de Jong we all know he doesn't wanna join united.
For striker get Johnathan David, and for centre back get tomori, also love the vid keep it up
Latouro Martinez
I think you could sign Matty Cash from Aston Villa for the RB position. He’s been really good at the start of the season.
Sign Osimhen for that striker position
You should sign Sebastian Druissi he plays in the mls for Austin fc
you should 100% buy Frankie De Jong
Resembles United IRL w that first game tbh, Coming from a United fan.
Yo for striker I suggest VICTOR OSIMHEN  Midfielder DE JONG  Defence FRIMPONG
Here after Man utd just lost to Bayern😂👍🏾
Get bounejah he has 84 and hé is a St he scores oels like haalend and hé is algerian 🇩🇿🤝
Valverde very effective short term but camavinga is the best for a long term midfielder
Bring cesemiro replacement for future  i suggest Martin zubimendi
A st
Do a Chelsea rebuild in fc24
Hey sid u should get camavinga because he can not only he can give good passes but he can also play LB if your player injured
Yay I love man United da best
For a defender, you could’ve brought in Kalidou Koulibaly. United could’ve gotten him whilst he was at Napoli
For the midfielder you should 100% do barella or goretzka, for a defender you should 100% sign someone like umtiti who's career should be revived, or maybe sign christensen.
For the CM position I think you should sign Nico Barrella
For the midfielder position I think you should sign a young talent all the way from Italy Barella I mean cmon you barely use him
For a midfielder, you could bring in Reyna as a CAM. It is a United move to bring in a young player from Germany, or maybe even Thuram!
I think you should sigh Osihen from napoli because he is very versatile and he can just run through the defense and he is tall so you can easily send a cross in and he will get it
You need someone solid and quick on the ball in the midfield like Frenkie De Jong
sign enzo fernandez or mac allister
If u need a defence use Antonio Silva he is a Young Portugal center back with plenty potential
You could've score with Mount but you want to replace him that's why you didn't score with him Mount is a great player give him chance in the cam position
Buy gavi for the midfielder
Pedri
I think the midfielder should be     touchmeni he doesn't get plenty of game time in real Madrid but Manchester united he will get a lot of games time
I have already ordered it
WHO'S HERE AFTER 4-3 ???
The goat is back!
Buy bellingham
Give rodrygo number 11
Get frimpong for rightback theres alot of midfielders still so try work with them for now
For the midfield role go for Jude Bellingham. All round midfielder can attack and defend. A box to box. This can really help Manchester United get one step closer to the league title.
Sign Ivan Tooney he is a great striker
I think you should loan out a lot of players since they might have potential and you should also sign a stricker like Lisandro Martinez and a midfielder like Camanvinga for the versatility
SIGN CR7!!
Play amrabat and make him a permanent deal
Hey Sid for the ST role I think that you should sign Lewandowski because he can give you one or  two good seasons and he can also help Rasmus grow
Sign Luka Modric Cause he"s casemiros old teamate and brings exprience and focus to the academy
Sign enzo or caicedo😅
All I am gonna say for a signing is...........      Camavinga
Hakimi
i think if you want to get at least a europ spot you need a defender like škriniar
Bit unrealistic to sign rodrygo
Remember at the start of this episode you said you would chang Rodrigo's number but you didn't are you going to change next time? Keep it up 23:42
PCQ: I think you should sign a new right back because you are lacking in that department. Maybe someone like Achraf Hakimi because you have more than 200 million for your budget. Also love the content Sid, keep it up 😁
Sign de jong
Barella fits well and he has experience in midfield as well and he good in midfield
Could sign leao to CF and move to false 9
Day 1 of saying sign Harry muguire back Harry maguire
Could you start a create a club on ea FC 24
L
Could u do a villa eafc 24 rebuild they are cooking up and should get top 5/6 plz do it
Pcq: Sign a midfielder like Toni Kroos. He has experience with Casemiro and Rodrygo so the link up is there plus he is a massive upgrade on Mount. Also dont replace Hojlund because he is young and has time to prove himself. Plus he scored the clubs first goal under your management
u have over 200 million you could go for like pedri or bellingham
Can you plz sign jude Bellingham
Hi sid! Could you get jude bellingham as the midfielder? Thnaks!
Hey Sid i know you might not see this but i think you should it sign James Maddison  love your videos
by the looks of it eafc looks ass
I think Enzo Fernandez would be a good option
KEDBI
Foy your next career mode, Dortmund would be great, considering there struggling without Bellingham...
Can u sign ambarat
Sign Onana from Everton🟦 he is a beast and a great back-up for casi, hes big and strong
Palacios Argentinian cm at leverkusen
Gavi
Your should sign Gavi for the midfield
Get Vawerde he has good potential nd also gets cem to Rodrigo  10:58
i think that Alex Scott would be a great young backup and i would that Kolo Muani a good striker, YANITED YANITED YANITED🔴🔴
Play mount as striker and buy barrella or camaviga
watching Man Utd vs bayer rn and I was celebrating rashfords late goal vs Nottingham forrest and then I looked at the match and hojlund scored straight away
dybala ? till the time hojlund grows??
Musiala
Can you do a crystal palace plz with only championship youth players plz
Griddy FutFatish worst enemy
Please sign another goalkeeper that can challenge onana before he make the mistake he made in real life in game
Sign valverde or rabiot or maybe even kocku
I was exited until u dropped a man unt carrier mode. Fuck man unt. Love ur video tho
I would recommend barella
I’m watching Man U at halftime as u said am I worse than ten hag
De jong would be a good midfield option
Sign szoboszlai for the midfield position
in Højlund we trust.
same game i dont like EA
Gavi
barella for mid got pace to pass to hojlund
Modric would be perfect for that midfield but he is a littel bit old
trent alexander arnold is perfert you weaken your number 1 opponent with city and arsenal he has the pl experience you take renvenge from antony has a defensif contribution in the game and if he isn't already a midfielder make him one
Sign Xavi Simons he'd be a great addition to the squad.
Keep mason mount
watching this while united are 2-0 down 😂
Will you make a video with a Polish club?
Sign marcus thuram for the st position as he is cheap and i think he would work well for your style of play
Onana is bad too in fifa
For your midfielder you could buy bruno Guimarães from Newcastle
Sign gavi plss
Sign dominik szobozlai for your midfield or maybe pedri/bellingham bcs you have the money
JUDE BELLINGHAM
It would be cool to have a player like Kevin De Bruyne in your midfield. He's expensive, but worth every penny.
for a rightback position sign matty cash he's a great option
For the cm I think someone like  frenke de jong or barella seems the best options because of there skills and can control the field really well
Been here since fifa 17, you have grown a lot since then💪🏻keep up the good work, love ur vids.
I reckon you shld buy marcos llorente or fede valverde as they are both rapid and brilliant box to box midfielders. Love the name and the vids Sid!
Paqueta
Gavi
Sign leon goretza
I think you could sign Julian brandt
Hello
Joushu kimmich from Bayern would be class I’ve tried him and he’s good
Watching this while watching the live match 😂
Osimhen
PCQ: change martials number, give hojlund no.9 and give rodrygo no.11. Also for midfield, i suggest someone like barella or bennacer or tchouameni
Sign frankie de jong or perdi or gavi
You should sign sabozlai hes very good
I reckon you should sign Oshimen bc he is sort of a realistic deal and has the class to perform at the highest level. Sid I really hope you read this I have been a fan since the fifa 22 wolves career mode.
Gvardiol
I suggest Nicolo barella as he fits the ball playing role and has a good passing range, and likes to get forward and give it to the wingers
buy sesko he is fast and has a good shot power
It feels strange to think that Maguire leaving United to go to Tottenham would be an upgrade for him 😂😂
Pedri or Valverde
Plz would you be able to do a liverpool career mode series. Plz sid i beg.
Fc24 FIFA cancelled 24💀
Hi Sid how about signing caidedo as he can provide that much needed support for casemiro and could be his long term replacement and with a budget like that you could definitely afford him great video by the way keep it up❤❤❤
goretzka
sign gvardiol or saliba
Jude Bellingham is probably one of the best midfielder rn. He can create and score for you. But Gavi or Pedri are also good
I think you should signed Jude Bellingham oh come Avenger
For striker,try and maybe sign a player between 24 like Thuram
AMAZING Content as always Sid.  I think Camavinga would be d best option for the MID
For defense you should sign van de ven because I my opinion he could really do well and also you could play him as a bench player
Loan our Garnacho to grow
For midfield you should sign Verrati or Goretzka and for right-back sign Mazraoui
I think for midfield you should sign gravenberch because he’s young and Thomas Tuchel does not value him as much and making amrabat a permanent signing could boost your squad depth
and loan hojlund out
I think for striker u should sign osimhen but for a cheaper option I should go for karim adeyemi and change his position to striker and for midfield  for expensive option go for barrella or valverde and for cheaper option go for Enzo
I think u should make Rushford a st and get leao as the winger?👍
buy phill foden for midfield and buy kylain mbappe for peace for 70mill$???? make him comfortable and buy pedri for 40mill$ also davies from bayern for 20/80 mill if you want de ligit? 50mill$$$/70mill? joao felix he did really good last Match 120mill?
I think you should sign Frenkie de jong he almost signed for Manchester United and also he is a good player
I think you should sign verati good luck sid
How about Xavi Simmons when gets back from loan
If you are looking for a midfielder, converting a player called moleiro, it says he is a left midfielder but if you convert him to a cm, he gets a massive boost in his overall and his potential is also high!
Aww hell naw man.
You should alvarez he's 24 and he only maybe max 50million and 82+ rated for a new right back spend big and buy hakimi.
FRENKIEEEEE
Sign Kimmich as he has the mentality for what your team needs to get them back in shape
RB signing over mount and hojlond and a back up centre back  mine would be antiono silva or scavini.
camavinga camavinga camavinga
Stg sounds like stuji in my language which means "stooge "😂❤
you already signed one madrid player. but if you want to have a do it all midfielder with great potential. CAMAVINGAAAAAAA
Or you sign Jude Bellingham
Maybe for the midfield you could sign manu kone, Pablo Gavi, Frenkie De Jong or Camavinga
Sid u have any info on when sidinho is coming
Please sign harry kane
PCQ Bring Back Ronaldo to add a bit of experience and give him a a chance to prove his metal. Love the Vids❤
I think you should bring a mildfild that have the experience and the quality to win trophies, for me it should be de jong from barcelong by the way love your videos
5 hour gang  👇
Side just betrayed Barça I've been stabbed in the heart
i wound say jude bellingham but he does'nt fit into story which love see since liverpool want to sign him,what about musisal future star player for bayern similar to bellingham i think fit well plus his faster than  bellingham
I think you should sign Dominikszobozlai for the midfield role he can play rw lw and St and cm and cam
Keep Højlund as a starter. Enormous potential and they have just bought him this summer
Camavinga
Daniel Braganza
You should sign Jude Bellingham, his a baller ⚽
Pcq: mount in the midfield keeps losing possession, i think some a bit more experienced and versatile in that is very important for example barella seems pretty realistic but someone I think you should go for is rodrigo de paul, he will maintain possession and can make killer passes and not to forget he is a team player. Btw love the videos keep it up👍
should sign Kang in Lee as a back up striker, he can also play cam, trust
Please
Sing Zambo Anguissa sid he will really help casemiro in defense he will be the box to box
Nah elanga Griddying at old Trafford is maddd
sign LADISLAV KREJČÍ as backup cb
Zeileski seems like a good bix to box midfielder which your team seems to he lacking in
I think for the striker role you could sign Osihmen, I feel like you could possibly build the team around him.
Sid can you sign Valverde or Goretzka and I love the content
Bro it’s been 5h already plz post the next episode 😂
Tonali went to Newcastle. So, why not sign Barella, another quality young italian midfielder?
u should give ronaldo a second chance
For the midfield role you should definitely be putting that cash to use by signing the likes of Gavi, barella, maybe even camavinga
When u use amrabat go for 4231 wide so u can use both as cdm but when u use mount u can go back to a 433
I've got two good ideas there is Tonali who is talented and Benaccer (Algeria-Ac Milan) who is underrated
Sign alphonso davies
Put on Garnacho
Frankie De Jong
Pls don't sell Holjund or ganaçho they have great potential and can grow to be the best players for the club
I wanna see you manage in the sidemen charity match
Let mainoo be the back up for casermiro
I suggest you sign Barella or Valverde cuz they both very good in attacking and defending and u have the money to sign them.
i loved ths episode and cant wait for the next one
Also sign Barella or valvedere as they are good
Try get Jamal Musiala, Jude Bellingham or Pedri
For the midfield position I think camavinga will be great he's young and good
PCQ: I think you could get Gerrard Morano or Patrick Schick to be a striker which would also allow Hojlund to grow
Sign nuno mendes as he will be better than dalot and you could sell wan bissaka then play dalot right back
You should sign Gonçalo Inacio
Look at your team, you got Casemiro as the anchor man and you got Bruno making runs and playing as a CAM... what's missing? well that game controlling man, the dream passer, the pirlo type of player... Maybe De Jong? or someone similar
0:24 bruh
Pcq: you should try to sign donnaruma, he has the height and his ovr and age is really useful
Sid i think you should trust hojland to be the main striker but i would suggest that you get an experienced striker till hojland improves in his overall, and its definitely clear that you need to upgrade that right back position. Btw love the content, awesome job man😍❤️👑
Sign gavi because he is young and very good
Midfield sign Enzo fernandez
Pcq: you should sign frimprong or hakimi since their both fast and u need a rub whos young and fast to help wingers attack
With the high budget, get Valverde, he has a lot of potential and slots into that midfield very well
You might sign Kane with him also in your group stage in bayern
PCQ: I recommend barella he is underrated really good and you haven’t used much in Fifa 23
So you just done with FIFA 23?
how did you get fc 24 early
Hey sign Oshimhem he will be a beast
Sign Gavi his got the Manchester United midfielder mentality and loads of potential
Can I have fc 24 please
Sign gavi
Midfielder- barella
How about bringing back mason greenwood if he is available. .just my opinion..love to see him back playing for united...
DONT SELL HOILUJD  HE WILL IMPROVE HE IS YOUNG STAR TALENT
pedri. nobody else is needed
For the center mid position i think you should sign camavinga and train Garnacho sid
barella for cm
Most hardest job in real world
5 hour
Story wise: Redemption of Manchester United by buying Ronaldo and bring him back to the European league
Was waiting for the Barca Career Mode  Not gonna watch this
Sid sign martinez for striker and where is sdinho
For the cm goo for nunes good player and it will fit your team For the St goo for lsak good finisher and can give pass to the players
Keep Højlund he has High POT
Barella or goretzka they are both so good
Great video
Sign Richarlison he hawe olot of potentel
Try barella in midfield
De jong would be brill as he was linked to man u
MESSI
Can someone tell me man utd vs Nottingham forest there was 4 red cards for Nottingham and 3 for man utd
Sign de jong
PCQ: Barella is Good  and tactical
play eriksen as he has great passing and dribbling
I swear Sid chose united just to use garnacho because his luck with him in fifa 23 was appalling
SIGN VINI
Haaland
If you want a striker why not try Charles de ketelerae
This guy should be a manager in real life
Darwin Nunez for your striker
Pcq: i know it will be unrealistic.. but can you please bring back Messi and play him as a CAM? Couldn't imagine your first cm in fc24 without messi.
Sid buy Callum Wilson from Newcastle for the career he is a high pressing powerful striker.A good buy!
Sign Barella he was good last season for Inter Milan he is scored to 9 goals and six assists he is only 26 years old and his only worth 75 million Euros on the transfer market he got into a Champions League finals and he is also won the supercopa and his world class and he's a bit underrated in 55 matches 0.16 Goals per game ratio and a 0.10 assists per game ratio and a 0.27 goal and assists per game ratio and he won them the Italian cup he is an 86 rated card with 82 passing 78 pace 78 shooting 85 dribbling 78 defense 80 physical he is good when it comes to attacking and defensive just a reminder he is a midfielder he is not a CDM or cam but  you can probably make a development plan to make him a central attacking midfielder or a defensive midfielder has high potential one of the best in the game 89 potential and a good attacking and defensive workrate or you can loan him 14:53
For cm I really think you should get Youri Tielamans because  He has room to grow and it would mean a lot to me to have my choice ina video 😀😃😀
for cm i’d choose gavi or pedri because they are very young they play attacking football and perfect for the wingers to always ping it out to them
do valverde
Let’s go
I see frimpong as the right man for the RB position
Put your difficulty to Semi pro 😅
I know that this wouldn’t be a realistic transfer but someone like Jude Bellingham should be perfect as he is high rated and still young so with the coaches he could easily grow to a 90+
I love your vids 👍🏾. Also, a striker recommendation is Julian Alvarez or maybe Karim Adeyemi as they are both young with lots of potential
Kavadiscellyer
Sing Bellingham
The most glaring issue for United IRL is the lack of box to box player for the midfield. They have attacking options, they have holding options. But no world class quality to compete with the big clubs of Europe when it comes from linking up the play. Mount is needing more time to adjust to his role, he's naturally forward playing, as is the case with Bruno. I wonder why van de Beek doesn't get a look since he's staying put. Casemiro is world class holding, but needs to stay there to cover the back line. McTominay doesn't know what he wants top be and isn't ever going to make sense of it as far as I can tell. After them, who do you have? Eriksen isn't suited to do it. Another forward playing guy being asked to fill a role he isn't adept to.   It cements why ten hag wanted de Jong so badly. He was the perfect signing United needed to create that balance in the side and complete that spine. It's pretty cliché to say de Jong, but he's an option and, if not him, someone of his type. Gravenberch was a player linked and, while still more for the future, he could have been that guy and he, like too many others, have been left to go to a rival. Again, not realistic, but Valverde would be another example. Capable CM and plays off the right where you have Mount now. Barella is another less realictic option,. but I immediately thought of him when word broke that the Toon got Tonali. Was rumours about Goretzka. De Paul too with Atleti.
Buy James Ward-prowse🔴⚫⚪
You should sell casemiro cause he is going to start losing rating rapidly soon so sell while you can get him for a high price. Buy a big man cb like Gvardiol for heading the ball in corners because you are good at those and for more defensive power. Finally purchase edrudo camavinga  for his speed, offensive, and defensive capabilities; later on he can be used as a great super sub.👍⚽️⚽️⚽️👍
Frenkie de jong is the best and most realistic one for the midfielder signing, he has been linked to united plenty of times and is a real good player
I think you go big and sign pedri because you have the money (i think) and he is a magician on the ball
JAMES WARD-PROWSE
For cm get Camavinga he's just the best and he's young
Maybe camavinga
@S2G Buy James Ward-prowse hes cheap young good with vertical passes and he has 5star Free kick abilities
Day 23 of asking S2G to fix lille
Camavinga or Musiala or just Eriksen 😊😊😊
Please use mac alister
For cm try maddinson
he copied tottenham's play style
This game actually looks good
Need Sid as manager
Plz sign Ivan toney we will be a baller
I think you should sign Kimmich
Barrella
Harvey Elliott has good potential and is a pretty all round player
I like to see Højlund or haaland
ronaldo
Rodrygo unrealistic He is untouchable
its not holland its hoylund!!
Don't sign a midfielder instead play amrabat
Buy Frankie De jong
The midfielder should be jude bellingham plsss sid
Keep rasmus and sign valverde, kephren thuram or brandt
Watching this during school 💀
For the midfielder position you should buy gavi as he is young so he can bring dome fresh legs in 5he midfield and he will help you in both attacking and defensive situations
jeremie PINGPONG
Please do sell Rashford,Bruno and Onana.... fraudddddddddd
Pcq:try to get a replacement for mount like pedri or gavi
Oshiem is a great stirker
Use Amad for RW rotation and give him some minutes. Would have loved Pellistri instead but the loan 💔
I think that you should sign Valvarde From Real Madrid because he's Yung good attacking and Real Madrid just signed Jude Bellingham to replace him
Sign Frenkie De Jong since they been trying to sign him for sometime now. And Fringpong for RB.
for CM sign bennacer or bellingham to get revange on liverpool for steeling anthony because jurgen klopp desperately wanted him.
For a striker ronaldo and defender marquinhos
buy Ward-prowse he will be really good with vertical passes to rodrygo and rashford and hes great at free kicks
Put Haland or messi on top trust me there insane
“Ramus haaland” 💀💀💀
Sign bellingam
You should definitely buy adeyemi. Only 21 or 20 I think and incredibly pacey as well.
Hey Sid, You have to look at your players playstyles to get more out of them. Love your content
trust Mount
Musiala
Pcq: you should sign Frankie de Jong I think he’s perfect and he’s been linked to united for a while
For CM i think Barella and Ryan Gravenberch would be great
maybe year two or three check out scalvini growth cause right now plays for atalanta and is a very exciting prospect
You need to sign Thuram and araujo
You should sign Sandro tonali as he is an amassing player and can replace mason mount
3hour gang
Damm
Fun fact the coaching staff was in fifa 04
Sup people
put dalot in the starting line up he’s class and has more potential
Sign Isak from Newcastle.. He is performing well
Pcq: try using a 4-3-3 holding so you can use ambrabat and Casimir o at the same time
For the midfielder role I would suggest you to sign bennacer as he is good defensively as well as in creation of chances
goretzka
For that midfield role sign Joshua Kimmich he has the stamina and defencive ability to assist Casemiro and also just control that midfield
Sign De gea Again
day 2 of asking s2g to fox werder bremen
De Jong is Ten Hag´s dream signing, sign him ;)
Barella in the Medfield and lautaro Martinez
Pcq:be more realistic. Man u signed hojland as main striker no need to sign anotger striker. Sign de jong frim bar elona as he was linked to man u
sid, i think you should sign gavin bazunu or vandevoordt for your backup goalkeeper, and for the midfield i think you should sign barella or leon goretzka, they would be a good addition for the team
Frankie de jongh
Adeyemi is young and thiago is old so that should be good
Paqueta
Day 8 of asking for a porto rebuild
i think you should buy florian wirtz sid. btw this is an awesome video
Can’t wait  for a new game with a new name😂
Try to bring in Musiala/Kimmich for midfield, Pedri would be interesting too
I woud play ambrbat at cdm and casemiro cm
save caiceedo the ecuadorian from chelsea by adding him to your the midfield
When should sign Cozer Dubbery from Arsenal
Under 10 hour gang
Get enzo but no new striker
btw did you know that at 21:15  it looks like each team got 3 reds each lol
You should buy joao felix for a striker
Career barca
Sign Barcola for right wing
Reece james at right back (should you sign one ) he is great defensively and has the stamina to run forward and help the attack and obviously get back to defend and great leadership
sign barella for the cm role
i think you should play amrabat and casemiro in midfield along with bruno. thats gonna strengthen the defense hugely and allow casemiro to make some more offensive runs as he does irl. and at right back i think wan bissaka is just perfect but you should get a better left back
I feel like pedri can be a good fit since he can control the ball in midfield can take long shots and does some defensive duties
I think Dalot is better than wan bissaka
Sign szoboszlai for midfield
I was watching your videos for a while and if I'm not wrong,in a man united rebuild Llorente was a beast when he comes into the lineup straightway
Frankie de jong we have alot of budget specially after selling Antony he could play as a cdm or a cm.
Barella is a good CM
develop hojlund as a future star!
Buy Bellingham/ camavinga for cm pls
for a mid u should get marcos llorente
RB you can try to buy Jesus Navas or Frimpong And for CM you can try to buy Camavinga or Gavi , Sid love your vids amazing content ❤ 🤩
you gotta buy quicy promes bruh as good rashy is you need to make your own identity
Keep Hoijlund as he is 100m play, should be starter.
4 hours ago
You should sign gavi as he is amazing and you love him and he has great potential
Lewandowski because you will get old but he will pick time for Holland time to go and I love the content keep making your videos❤❤🤲🤲
you need to sign krephren thuram
You should buy floran wirtz as a midfielder
Enzo Fernández as the Midfielder   Love the videos man, maybe it's time for sidhino On S2GMore channel ❤
you should sign manor solomon from spurs as a backup winger
You need a player like Paqeta
I think signing mbappe would be realistic😂. Nah but you should sign valverde or barella
Learn to pronounce the names properly please💀
👹👹 best midfielder I suggest to buy is Valverde. has good pitch coverage, defensive stats are good and is very quick with good passing and is young. pace will be good as he can keep up with the attack and also track back and help out when defending 👍👍
Sid I think for a defender you should buy de ligt  or Saliba  there young and have potential
for cm i think u need a box2box mid and spurs' bentancur who played well and scored against u is a great option
I think Frenkie de Jong or Nicolo Barella will be a great player for that CM role and I also recommend a new RB as well
PCQ: for the midfield position id prefer goretzka Dani Olmo or Bruno Guimaraes Edited: I'd prefer Bruno Guimareas coz he'll be less expensive and worth it
15:40 wrong amrabat. Nordin is his brother. United have signed Sofyan. His brother plays in Greece.
Sign frankie de Jong as it was a rumour earlier
And Højlund is spelt Hoylen
Keep hojlund and let him grow, he might be a great player
going to suggest, the best midfield to buy in my opinion would be Valverde, has really good pace to move up the pitch and spray balls to the forwards if needs. has good pitch coverage and is defensive minded. 👍👍👍
Love the video Sid!  Btw it’s pronounced Hojlund instead of Holland
Please sign GAVI or pedri
sign somebody like jota or halland
Love the content bro👌
Don’t get rid of hojlund he’s young with high potential and he’s the future of our striker
Don’t sell Hojlund or buy a better striker
Nice one 😊😊
Buy victor oshimen as a st and buy Ruben neves as cm
Bring in frankie de yong
Barella or Tonali
Trust Mount, revive his career and let him grow, focus and getting better bench/defense, perhaps sign Joao Cancelo and prove City they were wrong in taking him out of the team and sending him on loans
Lets vote for valvarde in man utd
Aa a  perfect signig i think you should sign a rb because mount is young and has potential same for garnancho but Wan Bissaka is around 25  so sign either malo gusto or marzarri
Keep Højlund! Let him get a chance
maybe for cm Jude Bellingham because he is young and has great potential
For CM/CAM you need to buy Maddison bc in real life he win the POTM award😤😤
Sign OCT.Popescu a 74 19 yr old
Messi
I think you should sign valverde , Gavi or Barella  They are young and can help the mid field a lot and try signing a CB may be Militao from Madrid or De light
Sign Alvarez for striker
21:10 bro why do you and Nottingham both have 4 red cards
4 hour gang
Ronaldo
Hey sid can u sign mukoko for striker he's a young talent and ig man under would be great for him

Sign Jeremie Frimpong for the RB position
Buy frenkie de Jong as he is linked to utd since 2021 and get dalot to start the game
Sing Youssouf fofana and jude Bellingham  or salah
Pcq: I think you can try signing Jeremey Frimpong for the right back position as he will develop well and he also links with man utd lots of time before
Take Pedro Porro at RB
you should sign di marco
De Jong or Limer from bayern
I think it would be great to have a good ball handling player in the team, so I think the best choice would be Eljif Elmas or Renato Sanchez
SIGN Jude BELLINGHAM HE IS GREAT
Sign Frenkie. We were actually close to signing him so maybe sign him. Enjoy your videos. Love from India
Keep Højlund at striker and get De Jong or Barella at CM and Frimpomg at RB.
I think you should sign martin odegaard because he is killing it in real life and I am a arsenal fan
Sign barrela for the midfeild
Selling Antony was quite a stupid decision 😢😢 He's good
I love how he purpolesly missed with mason mount for an excuse to get rid of him
It’s not smart to move on from Antony
4 hours late but anyway great video glad you got to play on EA FC 24  Also,Ruben Neves may be a good player in midfield.He can play in centre midfield.He would be a great player to have.
Sign João Pedro for the ST role! He's got a lot of potential (and another brazilian in your squad)...and he scored against Man Utd last week! Makes sense imo
Keep mount,play him higher as a cam
Sid i think u should sign ballers like gavi or pedri
sign pedri
It's a good day whenever Manchester united lose.
U need to buy a midfielder like valverde whose pace is really going to help wing playstyle
sign Valverde from real Madrid because he is the most well rounded player pedri/Gavi
They should add an option to make club statements ngl
are you playijg on PC or PS?
I think u should buy tchouameni from real madrid he is pretty good or  bellingham but its your choice
Try to sign gavi because he doesn't play much for Barcelona
pcq : sign todibo or atonio silva as united are interested in these young prospects in irl
As a United fan it's amazing to see u do this + I would love to see Barella
You will be better then Ten hag for sure
Harry kaneee
Yo S2G , try fm24 this year also
bro sign someone from chealsea
You should buy midfielder like Pedri or Gavi because they are the best in the game. And I think they will help to go to the top and fight with big teams like man city,Liverpool etc
Sid love your content I think you should sign a full back to help your wide game play
Get Valverde and John stones pls❤🎉 love your content
But we still need a barca career manager mode 😂❤in EA FC 24 when the game releases with your copy
Do sidnho ❤❤ full episode
I suggest you get a midfielder like barella or valverde because u do not use them much and love the content sid❤
You could go all in on Bellingham or buy barella
🔔ingham
A good CB for depth is lacroix he Is young with great potential
You should get a CB becouse varane alwayes gets injurd
Gravenbech or szobozlai
Buy victor osimhen and Pedri and also change your tatics to tikka tikka
Please  can you buy    M. Kudus
A striker you could look at is Alexander isak he has great potential and would definitely fit       into your squad
Bro mount is good bring better striker like oshimem 🚨🚨
I think you should bring in bellingjam to enforce to play style or phil Phoden and convert him to cam
Sign a barella or gavi
Haaland Haaland Haaland
Get James Madison for the cm spot to replace mount
15:44 it's Sofyan😅
Sid, a midfielder like Vithia (PSG) will be perfect for this Man United team.
You need camavinga with 80 overall 89 potencial and it's cheap.
Hi sid,for the Rb position,Im thinking about Reace James For the Cm position,Im thinking  Kovacic
You should sign Dominic szoboslai
oshimen
You could use Lovro Majer as a midfielder
I was waiting for the Barca and I saw man u 😭😭
I love Haaland he is a goat
I suggest you sign a barcelona midfielder, de jong gavi or pedri
If this is HOw EAFC24 Will look its crime to pay over 40 euros
GLORY GLORY MAN UTD
Lol as Doyle is ex city player
Hi Sid I think you have to sign lautaro Martinez he is very class and has good potential for the cm position de Jong would be brilliant since ten hag wants him in real life
You should sign camavinga and convert him back to a cm
Sign de Jong he is linked to united always
Good option for cm is goretzka
Sign Bellingham and Enzo
Osihmen
Buy haaland
I think you should sign Pedri instead of Mason, Mount
Xavi simons needs to join a big club. He’d be the perfect signing. He’ll definitely be in your future plans as well
Buy gavi  or valverde
I think u should keep it realistic. Give rasmas a season and if he doesn't work out, then sell him and bring someone else in
Get vector osimin and De jong
Hi sid for the midfielder i think You should sign kroos

I think yo should sign oddergard he will make good passes and bring the de bruneye feeling
midfilder simon will do better
I feel as a United fan, you need to get mount out of the club and get a quality right back… those two positions are the weakest links in the club
Get de jong from barca and  i am a big fan of your content
Sign Gavi for the midfielder
De Jong Can Work For You And Kessie Too He Will Be The Most Sensible And Great Signing You Should Sign Both Of Them ❤
I think you should sign someone like Pedri as it will fit your Barcelona style! And he would be great as a box to box
"Thats the new feature in EAFC, clubs are going to make more sensible signing." sells Antony to Liverpool...
I think you should buy either Valverde or Bennacer. Anyway I love your videos.
RB - frimpong CM - De Jong
Keep hojlund and grow him as a man itd legend
Pcq: my other comment said sign Álvarez but now you want to keep hoijland I’m suggesting kephram thuram as a cm as he is good in both attack and defence
Benzema
PCQ : give mjberi more game time because he has good potentiel
Sign James ward prowse because of his set pieces and playmaking
Sight gavi
Mbappe
The shadows in the forest game were terrible
PCQ: I think you should sign Nicolo Barella. He is a great midfielder and will help out your team a lot
Get camavinga or Valverde  even kone is a baller
i think you can sign in cm camavinga
is sidinho coming back?
Striker ohsimen or Kane  Midfield :Camavinga
Trust rasmus hojlund he is a good player with good potential build the team around him
julian alverez or maybe lautro martinez
Ooh
I vant goretzka barella and valverde
For striker
Mbappe or ronaldo
FC24 is what takes us to 1 mil
For the cm position you can go for goretzka as he has the physicality to defend as well as support bruno for attack
You should buy  Martin Ødegaard to make Arsenal weaker even tough IT whould hurt for me because im a Arsenal fan but its tactical
For the striker position you should sign kai havertz from arsenal
Cm
PCQ: Sign Zaniolo , play him Rw and make Rodrigo ST or CF
Use a veteran as the striker position (Lewa or Kane) so that Højlund can be used in the future!!!🎉
Hey Sid I think goretska or camavinga as Utd were linked to goretzka and he doesn’t play for Bayern, but camavinga is versatile and cheaper
Sign vlahovic for striker
give hojlund a chance....sign a mid fielder like vitinha cause he has good potential or go big and sign pedri or de jong
Mbappe
Please keep Rasmus Hojlund as 1st choice striker
Day 21 of asking for a Coventry city rebuild in ea fc
Weghorst
3 hour gang!!!!!!!
Maybe sign Fede valverde for cm over mount
You should sign TAA he could play mid if you want
You should sign Kone as he is good on the attack and defense,also give Garncho more chances
Awesome
Sign pablo gavi
Sign a new midfielder Bellingham or musiala or tonali
PCQ: you should sign Xavi Simmons for the midfield role
WHAT IS HOJLUNDS FACE
Is it just me or are the graphics kinda bad
CAMAOOOOOOO CAMAOOOOOOO CAMAVINGA
i know he would be expensive a bit but if i were you i would buy enzo fernandez hese way too young he still has a huge carrer to complete he even loves to tackle and gives assist he would be an option and if not then de jong is my other option
Before this game came out i thought it would suck but wow i thinks its much better i was smiling the whole video. Also a good midfield should be enzo fernandez or barella
Are there also real managers
Openda could be a good option
Rb frimpong
You should sign kokou or Pedri 😂
Sign alvarez kr kolo muani or goncalo ramos and change the formation to 4-1-2-1-2, and play 2 strikers, also sign pavard or dumfries for RB, and theo hernandez or alphonso davies or balde or zinchenko for LB
Pcq: I think it would be good if u signed Julian Álvarez as he isn’t a main starter at city and could be a future star for you
U should start Amrabat we saw the balance he brang to the midfield about Spurs and I think if u start him Mount will be forced to improve
Imagine A duo midfield with Bruno and Bernardo Silva 🔥🔥
Keep Rasmussen hojlund as a starter,also give rodrigo a crucial squad number
sign MIlitao for CB
Play mount itself keep it more realistic since he was Ten Hag’s first and priority signing
Hay man for that cm spot well you should go bug with that money so you can buy the best cm in the game valverde so it can help in both attack and defence and can play anywhere in midfield and you bought rodrygo so its a small chemistry
Bro sign vlahovic
holand
😅  haaland
PCQ: Højlund‘s name is pronounced Højlun
Will you bring back Mason Greenwood?
S2G you can sign Dybala and use him as a CM. He would be a perfect suit for Manchester United. If not, you can use Antoine Griezmann and try to revive his career. He has huge potential to be a star at Man United.
You should buy Frenkie De Jong from Barca, he's been ETH obsession as from the beginning, and you can make it happen Sid. 🙌💯
Buy camavinga adds both defense and attacking prowess to the midfield
I think that thuram will be the best option pretty cheap talented
Waited for it so fucking much!!
For the midfeild role i think a Regista kinda player maybe that's missing i suggest Nicolo Brella or Bruno Guimaraes maybe be ideal or If you need a player that could drive the ball forward you can opt for Pierre emile Hobjberg, Mikel Merino, Adrien Rabiot or Chalhanoglu.
Sign Giorgio Scalvini As Varane will drop in overall and till then U can use him as back up
The game looks so bad
PCQ- A top RB option is Jeremie Frimpong from Leverkusen Young Lad Great dribbling and brutal pace of 94. And also I have been watching you since 2021 love your content pls dont stop and keep on going champ.
For the midfield you should try giving hazard a chance and also Xeka could be a nice addition in the midfield and I really enjoyed the video!!
I think you should sign Ivan Toney
Rodri
Bro don’t act like some weirdo saying u want Antony gone he ain’t done shit used to watch u but Allow it now tbh
Rodri
Part 2 plz sid your the best YouTuber
I don't know if you'll read this but why not make a manager career based on a player's real life form or performance
Rasmus holland💀
sign Matheus Nunes for CM position. This guy is too good.
Pcq:I think you should pay with more of a possession based game playing at the back and later releasing to rashy and rodrygo
I think you should sign a striker like vlahovic or osmihen
You shold sign Trent or Walker.
In my opinion you should sigh Bruno.G
I feel like the signing of diogo jota will be intresting to replace hojland as hojland doesent have increadable potentialbif fifa
i think mitoma would be a good super sub for the left wing tho
Barella seems to be realistic and fun. + you've not used him much in fifa 23. Solid Option To be Honest
For CM position bring in Valverde cause he is good and very underrated
I think you should give mount another chance with different instructions for him.
I would find Camavinga or Marcos Llorente good😊
You should sign Pedro Porro at right back or someone like odegard for center mid
Sign Enzo cause he is being wasted by Todd Boehly
For centre midfielder go freinkie den jong he was about to Man Utd or barrella
galatasaray = smallest club in Turkish league
i think you should make rashford on striker plan and garnacho or may be sign new lw
10 seasons without paok
Gavi
You should sign pedro Neto the next Ronaldo !
I think you should sign Valverde as you have a lot of money
Bring Ronaldo
Kostantelias
Rabiot is a great option he is has great stamina
An buy Salina of centre back
I need you bring back mason Greenwood back to united at some point
Pcq:- place mount on CAM instead of CM.
As a United fan I'm glad you're doing my favourite club's CM series looking forward to it Like if Sid the GOAT
Try and sign Mbappe given that PSG wants to sell him as soon as possible
Striker- Victor osimhen Midfielder- use sofyan ambarat or jamal musiala or jude bellingham  Centre defender- kim min Jae Left back--  alphonso Davies  Right back-- jeremie frimpong
If you want  to get revenge on Liverpool by szboblzia  but buy pellagrini
De jong would be good for CM
Make rashy a st and give garnacho more playtime and make hojlund a super sub
Who do you support sid love the fact you always choose different teams
I think you should sign De Jong to play CM for you. Sell Martial and sign a different striker as a backup. Maybe sign a Luke Shaw replacement too
Ayo Sid please bring back pogba for cm position as he knows the club already.
You should sign Sesko, he's young has pottenial, and if he's lower rated he will be good squad depth
Youth academy please
Manager kinda look like messi haha
Do Liverpool next please bro
Thats hojlund from wish
Less goo sid!! 🔥 As a united fan, would love to see u keep rasmus as that main guy up top
For the CM position i would recommend renato sanches, pretty good overall and hes got the strength and versatility to fit in your team
U need another cb /lb and please sign zaha
Hoping to see a barça remake on the official release ❤
Sign Reece james
I think that for the CM position you could go for De Jong or Joelinton Also for RB I think that frimpong would be amazing
Bellingham is your best option he is one for the future and calm on the ball also Gullit gang on EA FC
I think you should sell Martial and bring back Welbeck, he's been really good recently, and also for midfielder what about signing Paqueta who was wanted by Pep, or Palhinha from Fulham
bring season objectives back
Sign enzooo
sign ryan gravenberch
As a city fan but this was epic
Sign Reece James as rb
hey sid i think for deffends sell luke shaw and replace him with balde he fells good and his pace is insane and with money replace mount with gavi (i think you can buy him )/ or pedri
Sign enzo
Someone like Gavi or camavinga will be good as CM option
Sign enzo
Can u please do one with liverpool after pls
buy a rb or rw since youre playing wing play
Buy Pedri he is the next Iniesta
Ronaldo and de bruyne
Buy bellingham
Love the content and I think you shld bring merino for cm and Alvarez for striker
I think u should sign Midfield have deadball and pinged pass playstyle
Sign mbappe or Diogo jota
Bro pls play a GK career mode  day 15
I think you should keep Hoiland and sign a Florian Wirtz because he can make the midfield much stronger, and support the attackers.
PCQ: You should sign a young Brazilian striker to link up with rodrygo to bring out his full potential
If day that you’ll really need a lb because you can play Dalit on the right grow him out and maybe sign Grimaldi for the lb postion
buy a rb
sign enzo fernandes
For the midfield why not go for Rodrygos former team mate camavinga
Pedri
Sign Enzo fernandez because you have more funds now
change the formation and use casemiro and amrabat as the holding midfilders and use your wingers during the attack since they have a lot of pace
Hi Sid,I think you should sing Gavi for that cm role.He's good on ball,good in defense,has unlimited stamina and is also able to score
I think you should sign de Jong linked in real life for a while and would be a great box to box mid. Also try and find the next Valencia for right back
Sign Geertuida, he is really good irl. When Shaw will start to go down you can replace him
Keep Højlund!!!!
Gavi Petri
Hey sid i think for the midfield role u can buy enzo or douglas luiz or frankie de jong
Bro just made Benzema with more hairs💀
You should sign Jude bellingham
Get United out the mud😂😅 You’re our only hope!!
Sid you should sign jude bellingam or frenkie de jong
Sign jota
Can you do Liverpool please
For cm i say gavi or trent
Pcq:Bring in frenzied de Jong he was rumoured to join Man Utd and so make it a truth in real life
Sid!  I pre-ordered the game in the summer, with the Ultimate Edition version, I downloaded it but it won't let me open the game.  Could you please help me with this?  Thank you very much for your answer in advance!
Buy footballers who are criminals
Gorezka or valverde or make trent a CM instead of RB he is very good as a CM in game
Valverde would be very good for the midfield
Goated vid btw you sign Nicola barrella because he fits the United style
Traditions are meant to be... massive L
Nicolo barella could be a good option for a midfielder.
You should sign Lautaro Martinez he's really good for the striker positon and for the midfiel sign Brahim Diaz or Camavinga
for the cm i think u should sign DE JONG or CAICEDO hopefully caicedo dosent ditch u for city btw love the content sid keep up the good work
Rasmus hollond
Is it me or eafc24 looks shitier than fifa23
As a man u fan plz dont replace hojlund and give garnacho more chances plz they r the stars of r team
Sign for a New cm Maybe sign Lindstrøm From Denmark and concert to CM
for cm you will like you to buy jue belngam
PCQ: Dominik Szoboszlai is your best bet mate😂
Bro you are terrible in defending use jockey to defend and BTW for a midfielder sign Lucas paqueta or Joelinton😊
THE IRISH YOUNGSTER EVEN FERGUSON
Sign onana from Everton, if you look at most the teams in the prem they all have a powerhouse in the midfield and considering uniteds budget in real life he’s most likely to join. Goretzka and de jong is a signing for later down the line when you start winning trophies so it would be more realistic then
buy Jude Bellingham from real Madrid .
Hey Bro! I feel like you should sign Kimmich. He is good, young, would be a good CDM so would solve the defensive crisis as well.
People suggest pedri, but it's unlikely he would leave barca and join utd. So,  sign a player like who wants to leave the club. Maybe Rabiot would be perfect for cm. Sign Sergio Ramos for a leader in squad and as a backup, too.  And sign maybe cr7 in January window if possible, but it's unlikely, too. Sign this 2007 kid from Spain called Hugo Humanes for st backup. Let him grow. And sign Ben Pavarad for rb or even hakimi.  Maybe veratti for cm, but he's kind of mehh and Christian Romeou from Argentina. He's got huge potential
I was thinking thinking Nicolo Barella for the cm spot, great passing and dribbling and I think he would fit in perfectly.
Keep hojlund please pleaseee
Get Ronaldo
Kimmich
Please sign Pedro Antonio Porro Sauceda for the RWB position.
I think Tonali would be a good addition to the midfield, looks like a win-win since he's young and is definitely gonna develop, he can support Casemiro as well as help out Bruno in attack unlike Mount If not Tonali, then Ceballos could prove to be a gem as well!
Ronaldo For striker position
For the strike position Victor osimhen is a great option
I think a midfielder like khephren Thuram would be a solid option
change mount with rayan cherki
I think u should sign Frankie De Jong
Keep Mason
I would suggest a great cm and rb for your team for cm take valverde and for rb take hakimi
Sign lamine yamal if he is on ea fc 24
You should get revenge on Liverpool for trying to steal your players and steal one of their midfielders.
Sign ValVerde
Rasmus Holland
Tbh it HAS to be De Jong it was rumour for like my whole life jts finally time to get him lmao
Buy marco veratti he is fast and sharp Continue the good work sid👍🏻
For midfield, try signing lucas paquetá from West Ham. He is quick, crazy ball control and vision. One of the best midfielder in prem.  @s2g
Out of every club...you choose United??😂😂😂
Thank you god we need it
You should make Casemiro a cb and get some one like tonali
Kevin de bruyne  fofana or pedri
For CM I recommend Barella, De Jong, Pedri  Gortezrka, Paqueta, Kimmich,but if you’re looking for cheap Modric, Kroos
I think that you should sign an up and coming midfielder like gavi or pedri from Barcelona  or maybe ball out for a big signing like Bellingham.
And for defend i think timber is good, cause he's fast and young and great potential
Ruben neves back to Prem !!
Keep eriksen in Mount out Take a new defender with man marking skills
Id really say that you should sign Trent for a right-back.He can shoot,he can cross in from the wings,he can convert into a midfielder and he can play long balls for the wingers.
A right back like Frimpong is a really solid option
A draw against Forest and Sid is celebrating like he defeated Real Madrid 😂
Can’t wait for FC24 to come out! ✊🏿✊🏿
Bro it’s højlund not holland…
Bring back S2g FC
Sign Lyle Foster from Burnley 😢
I think you should sign valverde because it would fit perfectly in line up
Pcq: i played the closed beta and the coaches help your players develop faster not just give them rating boosts. And for training give all the players energy focused because stamina drains so quick now.
Please make it realistic and don't disrespect my guy ten hag
Sign Victor Osimhen. Pretty realistic transfer imo+they defo need a striker like that
Siddinho
If you want  a new  st you should sign  a player  like Marcus Thuram  or Diego  Jota
DE JONG ARMY
I think camavinga is great option cause, he can play different positions and great talent player
Please use Mainoo after he comes back from loan....
For CM, I feel like Pedri would be a solid option. He's the kind of a player who can control both the defensive and the offensive. For the RB, I think Frimpong would be great, as he can make those runs through, if needed. BTW very much excited about this MAN U series. Thanks a lot man.
Nico barrela
Looks like fifa can't they not change it
I think that Pedri could be a solid option for CM position. He's young, and has got a lot of potential.
Someone like De Jong solid midfielder been linked with Manchester United for a long time in real life and talent wise he has it
Don't replace ST
Sign Enzo ferndes
YES SIDDDDDDD
Sid, I think you should sign a good and young right back like Hakimi and Arnold because in my opinion, Wan should be a backup
Sid I I think for the cm you should think about getting barella ,rabiot or valverde and for RB frimpong
you should mabey sign Gavi or like Jude Bellingham or Pedri
Add a right back like Frimpong or Hakimi
The shadows are disgraceful icl haha
Get haaland
You have so much money sign KDB
Bring my guy Bellingham for CM from Madrid he can also play CAM in a different Formation
Frenkie De Jong
Get vlahovic
Neymar
Mbappe gang
try and see if you can get a beast like osimen on loan but if you can't then try and get a midfield maestro like Enzo Fernandez or de Jong
As a Man Utd fan I think u should have kept Pellestri and Mainoo in the squad for the season
I think  camavinga or  a player like jolienten or Valverde
Hey Sid. For the midfield, I think you should sign Camavingha or Musiala. Thanks for reading! SUBSCRIBE TO S2G!!!❤
For cm I think Pedri. Man U need another star boy and he’s the man for the job + he’s a great player!
Sign pedro Porro for your RB. He is great and will get loads of assists
So here are my suggestions Sub cb: Antonio Silva 79ovr 89pot 19yro  Rb: jermie frimpong 83ovr 88pot  23yro   Cm: star barella 85ovr 88pot 26yro
C. Ronaldo and modric
Sign a player like martin odegard from arsenal for your midfield
You singing leon gorezka and frankie de jong
Nice❤
Rasmus is right footed 😂
Sign ronaldo
2hr gang  👇
Sid, as you have unlimited money. You can sign jolienten or pedri or gavi and
I think Frenkie De Jong is the best option for CM as he can defend and attack and has really good stats all round
Sid said he likes that "Clubs will make smarter signings" while Liverpool sign Antony and try to sign Rashford😂😂
Do liverpool
change the formation to 433 (defense) and play casemeiro and amrabat in cdm and give bruno fernandes the freedom in the midfield then sign a young llorente he can play both, offensive and defensive midfield
Harry maguire gang \/
Sid you should buy martin odegaard
Kingsley coman
PCQ sign CAMO CAMO CAMAVINGA at centermid
try tchoumeni , edson alavarez or joao palhinhaa
we need  a player carear mode now
For CM why dont you sign Musiala or Gavi young CM that can be quick and nice playmaking and if You need a ST pls SIGN OSHIMEN
Throw  ten hag and sign sid right now Manchester united 😂😂😂
S2G PLEASE SIGN BELLINGHAM AND TRY TO GET HIM FOR 30 MILION PLUS MASON MOUNT
Sign Mohammed Kudus since he was linked with signing for Liverpool for revenge
You should sign Martin Baturina he has lots of potential
I guess Sabitzer or De Jong anyone of them would be perfect for CM role   For striker I guess Vlahovic or Adeymi can do the job 😊
Goretzka and evan ferguson or Benjamin sesko to challenge højlund
sign gavi, renan lodi and frimpong because theyll be within your budget and theyll grow in the team
bro sign Kolo Muani
i think wirtz is a great option👍🏻
Guys can any one donate me money to buy this game am broke af 😂
I think you should sign someone from Prem so that you can weak your rivals
Hey Sid, as a man utd fan im excited that you made a man u career mode and as a midfielder for you to sign I think you should consider Florian Wirtz. He is a german cam and is a really good youngster in germany.
You shoud sign Cristiano ronaldo becouse when he Will be old Rasmus Will be reddy
Sign frenkie de jong
Damn it feels so weird to not see Sid as the manager now 😂
PCQ sign hakimi as a new right back he is pacey so can help in attack and defending he can whipp in good balls for the Brazilian rodrygo
Phil foden
I think that you should keep hojlund because he's young has an amazing potential and can score goals
Sign pedri or gavi for mildfield please
Bellingham
I think you should sing Camavinga
Maybe Tonali
Pedri or Gavi for midfield position?😁
Belligem
As for the striker position get a veteran player as then you have a good striker and Hojlund can grow in overall
Hey sid u can sign De jong after he was so close and mann unt dream come true on signing de jong
Camavinga for the CM will be a good balance as he is left footed and versatile.
the goat is back
Hey sid I think for cm position you should sign Ryan Gravenberch the new significant of Liverpool he was amazing at Ajax but didn’t got the play time at bayern munich
For cm Sid should sign Kephrem Thuram from Nice, he's young, versatile, offers defensive and offensive cover. Perfect midfielder.
Why doesn’t he use a Casemiro - Amrabat Double Pivot with Bruno Fernandez as the Attacking Midfielder  4-2-3-1
I don't know , I saw many people playing FIFA but still I like Sid
Hello from Niger
for midfield you should  get Enzo Fernández
Jude Bellingham 🎉
I feel you should sign jude Bellingham because he is a young and great talent for cb you could sign gvardiol or ruben dias
add a RB for wan bissaka
I think you should keep wan-bissaka, he might not be the fastest right back but i think in real life he is one of the best defending right back.
I think u should buy victor osihmen since he was linked to untied before and I think with his upgrade he got he would be unreal also love the content as always ❤️
you got amrabat as a center mid he can really help you
You should get Valverde or Pedri
Hey you can try getting , camavinga , musiala or guendozzi  u also havee somee players like r rodri
Sid just stick with Barca 💀
To replace Mason Mount sign Marcus Llorente from Athletico Madrid,he can score ,can defend,he does everything
Fabio Miretti has a great potential. You can bring him for midfield. Or use the money and get Pedri in the squad
I think for right back you should sign Frimpong. Young quick and would fit your vision
Resign De gea free agent back-up
Jeremy frimpong or bukari you could sign for good money and will become good after a few years
CM position I think Jude Bellingham
Change Rodrygo's Number
😅Get back CR7
S2G buy karim adeyemi
Buy a false 9 like Jesus
massive respect to you for not keeping antony. hope justice is served to him
S2g just a suggestion bring back press conference question system
Bro said man utd team is average
30 minute gang
By Maddison
Sight a mid
Real Madrid next plzz❤
I think for the cm a good person would be Frankie de Jong. He is someone that has continuously been linked and tried to be signed by Man United.  Edit: He has that versatility since he can play as a cdm
Sign frimpong he is goated and de jong
PCQ:Hi sid i think you should sign Kephren Thuram for midfield as he is young and fits the system
Make more videos
Buy tobido as they was linked to him in real life  Also buy a right back
You should bring de jong since his ten hag dream signing
Maby kolo muani pleeeeeeeas i am the most loyal fan
Pcq: sign facundo farrias from inter miami. He is very young and has tons of pontential, good for squad depth n your attack
S2g I don’t see u playing for united and England 🖕🏻
Striker ,we need promising young like osihem who in real life nearly signed,vlashovic from juve ,karim adeyemi ,goncalo ramos
De jong from Barca cm 87 (last year)
For the right back can you get achraf hakimi
ismael bennacer fits into this team like a glove and can play the role of a hybrid 6\8 very well, the shot on him is also monstrous
for rb i think should get frimpong
you could get pedri or even modric
Bentancur from spurs
bruh EFC24 is sweet, idea for a CM is de jong
I suggest u to focus on playstyle to get goals For example find player have deadball playstyle Or power shot playstyle  Find a player have pinged pass  To increase percentage of wining  To defend find a player have Block or intercept playstyle  FOCUS ON PLAYSTYLE
Hey Sid, For the Striker role, I think you should sign Callum Wilson As he is kinda underrated player for New Castle, I think that is the experience for Holland and he is also 82 rated I think that is good for Man United... And I love the channel
Get pedri as CM or get Bellingham I am sure u can get then for 2oo mil   that u got
Sign osimhen as a striker or a veteran striker who can help hojlund grow like choupo mounting or anyone else
PCQ:Buy Musiala or buy Yamal and convert him
Maybe sign gavi
I think you should get victor oshimen for st role
Sid you should sign leon goretzga because he is a class midfielder
Sign Sandro Tonali is one of the best talents in the world
After spending so much you shouldn’t be able to spend 200m more
Get Mbappe who cares if he cost 2 legs and a kidyney 😂
I think you should buy valverde from real Madrid as a cm he will really improve the team
Try to get Phil Foden as CM. I feel like his play style would fit the team and you get a backup LW while playing rashford as ST
pcq: I think Yousufa Moukuku Is Great for Striker From Borussia Dortmund Or also Vitor Roque Is Perfect
They did love the channel I been a fan for long I think for the striker role I think you should get Martinez for the striker role and for the midfielder keep mount pls
Midfielder
PCQ- Why not sign someone like Stefan Bajcetic for your midfield from Liverpool , He is a talented youngster and it would weaken the Liverpool team or maybe Ryan Cherki from Lyon , he has the talent too and we cant forgot our boy Eduardo Camavinga.Alejandro Balde for the LB position can be very very helpul too. What are your expectations for this season , can you fulfil them
He really thinks rodrygo would go to man United. They are a small club make it realistic
Day 13 of asking sid to rebuild Legia Warszawa come on it ea Fc 24 time
Get barella or varvelde
It would be nice if you tried to get a player like  Frimpong  , Joao Mario , Reece James , Arnau Martinez or Pedro Porro. They are great youngsters with alot of talent , good potential and can play well on the pitch.
My recommendations : Ferran torres LW🇪🇸 Ezequiel palacios CM 🇦🇷 Konrad laimer CDM🇦🇹 Lutsharel geertruida RB 🇳🇱 Santiago gimenez ST🇲🇽 Piotr zilenski CAM🇲🇨  Try signing one of these players ❤️
I think Fagioli, Bellingham or Barella would be fine.
Try to find the next Ronaldo with your scout plzzz
Please give me fc24  I have been watching you since 2019 Please
Bellingham for midfield
could u do an ultimate team career that would be awesome
Bring back ronaldo
go all out and by Bellingham love your vids btw
Sid you are amazing For the cms you can sign de Paul or frankie de Jong or llorente
Get kdb
Pedri cause I think he will Play the best in a few games but then he will be 34 years old  and then do you want to sine Gavi
We are going to win the treble this season
try to sign rudiger
PCQ:Put Rashford in ST and Garnacho at LW and find a new RW
Sign Maxence Caqueret from Lyon (78 Rated) High potential CM + you havent used in any of your previous episodes
Bro Barca beat Antwerp 5-0 do career mode of our team
Next Barcelona career mode
give mount time he can be special
fabinhio
I think Goncalo Ramos would be a perfect striker and midfielder there’s no better option than Camavinga
I think you should sign someone like gavi, or make use of amrabat on the bench,also fede valverde
Jonathan David would be a good striker option as he is to good for Lille. He is an amazing finisher and has loads of potential
bernando silva
Ho is watching  sid for so long raise your ✋ 🤚
Sign Valverde as he was linked to man u
PLEASE SIGN EDINSON CAVANI. HE IS MY FAVOURITE LOVE FROM JAMMU INDIA. CAVANI IS AGED BUT HE IS DIFFERENT. MOST UNDERRATED STRIKER
Resign de gea😢
if u want someone defense minded in midfield go for manu kone or khepran thuram.... Not expensive, young and pretty solid lads
kdb
Please do liverpool fc next I beg u
sign Gabriel Martinelli for striker or Aurelien Tchouameni for mid and Kvaratskhelia
Go back to the 4231. Casemiro cannot be the single pivot in real life nor ingame. he is just going to get found out. You can set him as the CDM and his double pivot partner as the CM. Amrabat is fine next to Casemiro, but you may want to sign a better player for that position, perhaps someone more physical like a serjey milinkovic savic. Playing with 1CDM is going to kill you off.
Sing Ronaldo
Hey S2G I think you should sign a player like Amadou Onana from everton for that midfield role as he was linked with Manchester United and would fit in perfectly with Man United
Pls do Liverpool 🙏
WHY IS RASMUS' PLAYER FACE SO BAD
sign nicolo barella for cm hes an insane playmaker to support rodrygo
will you do the sidinho career mode
Hey Sid, when can we expect the return of Sidinho.
sign Frankie de jong
A puttanata mammat
Mbape
Try converting amrabat into a CB
For the cm spot, sign Bennacer, Barella or Veratti. And for the striker position, sign Oshimen,  Lautaro Martinez or Goncalo Ramos. Love the content.
Les go can’t wait for ea fc
Maybe sign hakimi plz
Rabiot would be a good midfielder
Sign Valverde from real madrid
You should do a player career mode
Mikel mereno for real sociadad
Give number 7 to garnacho pls
PCQ: I think kimmich would be perfect for the cm role as he defends and also give support in the attack.  A signining manU needs to make
Bring in a box to box mid like  Leon Goretzka
PCQ: sign fede Valverde bcoz he will offer you in that midfield and right wing position
Victor osimhen or Dusan Vlahovíc since you only use them on take over series not actually career modes or maybe Jonathan David a less expensive type of CF
Yeah sign goretzka
Frenkie de jong would be a realistic and good transfer imo.
Salah
Could you make Garnacho a midfielder because you are wasting his potential on the bench and soon he would want to leave so use Garnacho in midfield and sign Martinelli for backup LW
Give hannibal majbri a chance in midfild ..he is a great gem..he score a great goal last game🎉
PCQ: for cm position I think Tonali or Tchouameni would be great signings because they’re are more defensive and both are amazing. Love you content btw.
It would be better if u convert rashford to cf and sell martial and sign a good lw or give sancho a chance for mid i would suggest leon and barella and sign hakimi
For the Striker go for Santiago Gimenez from Feyenoord. He's an insane player with enormous potential, top 3 goal scorer in Europa League last season. His touch, play, and physicality is incredible! He's someone to watch out for in Champions League this season! He has around 86 potential, but by the end of this season he has everything to make it to a top team in Europe.
Nico Barella would be brilliant as a CM as hes a profile of dribbling and press resistant midfielder the team doesnt really have right now
Yay so happy bring on fc24
Man said we’re not a counter attacking club 😭
Jamal Musiala for midfield
Bank the cash on a physical CM like Goretzka or De Jong (They were rumored in real life too), and trust Rasmus Hojlund up. Maybe get some back-up defenders.
Make Amrabat a starter, he is gonna be incredible!
Yo u gat højlund but no second choice striker maybe go for Goncalo Ramos from benfica
Already like FC 24. At least now you can score headers.
Since you got the money i think you should have fun and sign frenkie de jong for that midfield position
C.ronaldo
Pls sell onana
You have to sign Barella. He is the playmaker you need
Sine Mbappe
I think you should sign a player called Jadon Sancho who plays for Real Madrid in this career mode
Musiala from Bayern is a great player for your team
Osimhen
Bruh Love the new Series mate. Appreciate it! For CM, you can either go for young talents like Pedri, Gavi, Camavinga, Wirtz or Xavi Simons. You can go with a somewhat established player like Paqueta,  Barella, Ruben Neves or De Paul. You can also go for experienced players like KDB, Jorginho, Xhaka, Gundogan or Kroos
From bryn
21:15 is no one gonna talk about all the red cards 😂
PCQ : 22:06 In whole 65 mins of in game time you just did 26 passes ?? That's wayyy too less. You need to pass more. May be thats why you are unable to build up ?
I think you can sign some new talents in eafc 24 to make it more interesting
Goreska
I think with the money you have got you should look to sign some elite top players like pedri gavi jude or even valverder. For RB Reece James would be a good fit. Luv your videos...keep up the good work....waiting for Siddhinio to return.
Oshimen at striker and barrella
I can't lie the gameplay actually looks so different
Sign Barella
I'm so annoyed that you STILL can't put an instruction on your midfielder to be a box to box or anything like
Consider signing deJong or even Musiala . They have high work rate .. will be superb in attacking and as well as defense too when required
Rajmus Holaand XD
take camavinga and try playing him goalkeeper Im just kidding try tchouameni

Sign barella

Sid>any other FIFA content creator
You should sign di Lorenzo or dumfries for right back as they play as good leaders.
I'm a Manchester united fan and I'd love to see you buy frenkie de jong. Keep hojlund a starter of course. And in real life, garnacho should be a starter so please help him grow and make him a starter.
pcq; you need to trust hojlund and since it is not working in utd irl do something they would not sign trent and the un normal thing make him a midfilder
Don't sell rasmus hølund
Bro pls try to play more games and proceed the season slowly its more fun  Love ur vids❤️❤️
As a mid fielder could you get Callum McGregor I know he isn’t great but I’m Scottish so is he and he plays for Celtic and I support Celtic        Thanks Sid
Sid u should buy manor Solomon for a back up rw hrs good 👍

PCQ: Sid I Searched Alot ALOT For A Midfield Position..... I Found Nicolo Barella From Inter Milan. There Were Lots Of Rumours Of Him Going To Many Big European Clubs But He Stayed... He Brings The Defensive Support Against Better Times.... Would Love If You Sign Him. Big Fan!
Sign Valverde
In my opinion man u needs someone like martin odergard  I don't why but just put him in
Kolo M
PCQ: These might be a horrible suggestion, but for the midfield i'd, recommend Modric. He's 36/37 so I dont think he will be that expensive. If not, maybe Trent. According to his stats, e can defe- I mean pass really well. He can also shift from Right back to Cm. Finally, Bruno Guimares (maybe). I'll leave it there                                                                                                       Btw I'm a Chelsea fan
Kdb
.
GABRI VIEGA OR MILINOVIC SAVIC Would be quality for the mid field rule you can get nico Barella will be a quality cm
Jude bellingham
Get Alvarez🐍 for st and de Jong for cm
Keep højlund he has the potential
I think francie de Jong would be perfect can attack defend he's great but pricey
For RB I think you should sign Carvajal as man united have singed casemiro and now rodyrgo, carvajal fits the flow
SIGN MOUKOKO FORM BORUSSIA 😍

Sell Martial
Please sign pedri
For cm I think you can sign gravenberch because his playing style is class🔥 and he would play more like a CDM he would make your defence even better. Gravenberch is just 21 years old. U can also sign musiala he's lit🥶  More suggestions:Goretzka, incredible talent and fits ur team  Bruno guimares) joelinton 2 splendid youngsters, they have a good chemistry with casemiro   This vid was also a Banger 🔥🥶 Excited for the upcoming episodes
I think you should buy balogun for some depth in the striker role
I think dybala is a good player to sign because he is good fast and cheap
Valverde for midfield because he can replace Rodrigo at RW if needed. Love the vids!
give hojlund chance donot sell him keep it realistic by not signing more players it will ruin the series
For st Victor osiman would be perfect but if you don't have the money grizman would be good
I think you should keep Mount because he is still 24 and he joined in this transfer window
For cm i think u should sign camavinga hes very talented and very good in that position
Hey Sid, I love your series. I Think signing Harry Kane would be good because he is experienced in the prem and looks like the perfect captain in the team.
8:24 I've I heard what I've heard
buy fede valverde btw love your vids
Could finally sign Frenkie or try to sign Barella. Ugarte is the perfect Casemiro replacement when it is time to replace him
For the midfield I think Valverde because he can also play RW if needed. Love the vids!
Please do a West Brom rebuild as lots of players have had a down grade in ea fc
I think this is a last year career mode and not a EA sports FC one for this game it should be Like Liverpool, Luton, Leicester, Juventus, Napoli and them teams
You should buy Gavi or Pedri
I think Kevin De Bruyne would be solid he'll do a season or 2. Or My Idol Neymar jr he can play CM.
First EA FC 24 game 😢
I would buy a quicker player adyemi who can rotate with rashford between left wing and striker and also buy Gavi for centre mid
For st i think oshimhen  will suit❤❤
I think for a cm you should bring in bruno guimares he's a great well rounded cm and you'd be weakening newcastle
Sign Jude belliham
Love from SL wht sbt signing Cm Renato Sanchez
The player I think u should sign  is Toni kroos cuz he knows the team and he has good experience plus he will be cheap
Sid you should get tonali if you have the money to because he can defend he can pass and he can dribble so he would be great in your team to drive the ball forward
Can I have  fc24 sid please
I would love for you to sign lautaro Martinez and I think you will still have enough money for de Jong since ten hag wants to sign him in real life
Cm
Can u sign Bonaventura he might be pretty decent❤
Hey S2G is Lamine Yamal in EAFC 24? If so he would be a very good benchplayer
Can you do chelsea next
Unpopular choice for the midfield would be gavi since he has a high work rate and can give you depth on the wing
For cm sign florenzi ac Milan midfielder
I Think you should buy touchemeni for the cm position He has that perfect role for man united and is going to link beautyfully up with rodrygo. And i dont Think you should sign another striker you should trust Højlund and just have the pacience
2hour gang
Ronaldo
great content Sid, I would suggest getting an RB, like Tavernier or Frimpong
5 hour gang lol👇👇👇👇👇👇👇
For cm I think you should sign Pedri bcuz he can score goals and has the dribbling and passing
2 hour gang
Rasmus HOLLAAND
sign benaccer for the midfield. Love the video
PCQ: You should sign someone like vitinha or even Barella because that will fit your playstyle or play amrabat more often.
Browse Free Agents
Sid I think you should sign bissouma from spurs could be good to replace mount
Sid when will you do a player career
21:17 why are there 8 red cards?
Suiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii😅😅 Buy ramos for st And camavinga for cm
For the cm position,a player like Frenkie De jong can be good for your team.And you should consider Nicolo Barella!
W i missed ur managing series it was so fun now its back less go
I got the EAFC as well
Signing Idea: Fabian Ruiz or Lemar for the CM role, both 27 and have a decent rating
Sid please do for AS Roma
I think for CM position you should go for Leon Goretzka. Trust me he will be fire 🦁🔥
Please sign  Adeyemi
Musiala or gavi
Streets will never forget the fifa 20 man u carrer mode ❤️
The irony in saying he doesn't wanna pile on the hate of Maguire then piles on by referring to him as a meme, absolute mug
You should sign Kone for the cm position
Bring backup defender
PoV: Sign Ivan Toney as they are rumored to him irl
E so Fernandez is a good player to sign
my favourite man utd midfielder, NORDIN amrabat
You must sign De Jong
Sign Emre Can from Borussia Dortmund for CM - cheap, got a few years left, can play CM, CDM and CB but best at CM. Man U-ish signing.
Get griezmann up top
maybe try with Alexis Macalistar he will do the job for the attack take  Breel Embolo i played him in Fifa 23 and he is soo good
Wait what is S2G married 9:04 😮
Sid I think you should go with Angel Correa or Yossouf En nesyri because they're both cheap and quite good
Man wanted to see barca carrer mode first
Valverde 😌
Hey Sid, love the videos, you said you needed a striker so why not try Julian Alvarez.
Evans dad wtf are u on my acc
Sign camavinga
For cm I think Martin odegard is a great option. But you'll have to convert him to a cm from cam.
Try musiala
Sign Barella
24 hrs gang loving the sid content❤️
Arda guler or mckennie for the bench
lfc career mode aswell at the same time on the more s2g channel it wud be so cool.     or after this 1
is it really fc24 :0
Kamara from Aston Villa
Sid you should sign marquinhos as a defender
get Jube bellingham for the cm role he is one of the best in the game
U can sing lewandoiski
Barella instead of mount would be amazing
I feel that the graphics get worse
Bro you gotta get Ronaldo back 🐐
Fc24 is cool
I think Bruno Guimarães he fits into your playing system
I will subscribe you if you don't make RB Leipzig video in FC 24
In CM I think enzo Fernandez is an excellent choice
Keep garnacho a starter and hojlund garnacho should definitely have been starting 11 player
Buy pablo barrios or riquelme
PCQ: Sign Take Kubo from Real Sociedad. I think he'd be a good fit for the wing play vision since he can use his pace and passing skills to cross from outside or cut inside to create chances for his teammates. He can also play as a CAM if you need him to be more central. You can use him as a bench player/supersub initially but once he's a high enough overall you can put him in where you need depth.
2 hour gang
Why was there red cards against Forrest then nkt in the next clip
SIGN JOSHUA KIMMICH
Can you sign gavi please
Hey Sid you could sign camavinga 😅 for real he could play Lb,cm,cmd   he will he Beast in midfield   Like if you guys agree
For your CM position, I think you should sign Bruno Guimaraes.
PCQ: I think you need to get someone like frenkie de jong. He's so good in game and he was heavily linked with united for a while.
If your looking for a st option go for stephan mavididi as I used him in the beta testing he was a good player for me as he gets a +2 when you convert him for a LM to a striker
I think you should add someone like vithinha from psg because hes young and has insane potential
I think you should sign renato sanches or Daniel braganca from the old wolves career mode
One player you could sign for the future is hato starts in the 60s but grows mid 80s and dynamic player potential will kick in with some loans
It’s only 9 days until the game is released now, but it feels like forever I can’t wait!
Im sorry but you have to learn how to say Hojlund
Yo Sid I have 3 Reccomendations A Midfielder is Young Talented and Good Minded Matheus Nunes I know he went to city but still Striker I Have Benjamin Sesko He is so good and underrated  Right Back is Decent and cost A little money Sergino Dest or maybe pereira from leicester
Valverde maybe de Jong
Thx bro im a utd fan
I suggest valverde and a good rb like maybe Pedro porro or nuno mendes
For central midfield get camavinga,kimmich or valverde.For rb get Trent or trippier,love the vids btw👍👍
I think you should replace wan bissaka with someone like Reece James or Balde
Sid for the midfield I think u need xavi Simons or Ryan gravenberch 😅also so happy the series is back
Sign Darragh Burns
Please dont sign a striker we wanna see how good hojlund can be
Video Idea: Try to look for regen players lime Wayne Rooney, like other.......
think you shouold sign pape matar sarr as he is young and could fit in and is versaTile
For ST I reckon you go for Lauro Martinez as he is highly rated and has decent potential only 26 years old as well
SHOULD HAVE SIGNED TAKEFUSA KUBO
Bernardo silva
2 hour gang
Walfredo Rivera with the right development can be 90+ rated
I think u should sign martin ødegaard as he is a good player and will weaken your rival Arsenal
2 hour gang?
Spoilers
Ding valverde or de jong
You should buy camavinga
I think you should sign Harry Kane , because his playstyle is gonna match with your team 👌👌
For striker try Victor Osimhen. I want to see him in the premier league.
Hello FC 24 Hope it gets better
Maybe someone different  for left back like Alejandro Balde
Video Idea: You can sign Martin øregard bcoz you got so much money to bring him and also try youth academy in FC 24 maybe that could work
Hey sid I have asuggestion for you I know Holjund is great and All I thinks we should sign a fast 29 year old striker and send Rasmus on a loan or train him more. You are making good vids keep it going and you will it 1M Subs
What about Chelsea man
Sid you have build on amrabat who is on a loan deal
Probably James Maddison or Jude Bellingham would be great
choose Barella for your cm
PCQ: Please sign Victor Boniface / Evan Ferguson And Florentino Luis !
For midfield either start Erikson for some time if it don't work out try signing merino
buy ronaldo or messi suiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Kevin De bryne
Hey sid, I think you should sign a proper box-box, some options could be Rodrigo De Paul, Nicolo Barella, Fede Valverde, or maybe even Jude Bellingham
PCQ: you should invest in your youth academy as well as it be clutch for future seasons
I think u shoul get harvey elliot from lfc
How do u do touchline manager
Man united had some seedios money 😂😂
CAMAVINGA is the EXACT player you need in that team. Defensively very solid, Attacking very solid, Hes solid in every stat. Hes exactly what man u need. MAKE IT HAPPEN SID
Enzo Fernandes
1 hour  gang
Steal Kevin de bruyne  from man City and then city can't do anything haaland can't score without his back bone
Lautaro Martinez  for ST and for CM someone like Llorente from Atletico or maybe Goretzka from bayern
Please dont script too much
For midfielder I suggest you to sign  merino from real Sociedad
I can't believe it nearly already out
I think you must buy a ST which is Haaland or Mbappe
Buy pedri
i think u should buy mac allister or szoboslai from liverpool for like a revenge on anthony and hey they r doing good in liverpooll keep up the work bro
For the striker victor Boniface would be perfect love your work keep it up❤
Add holberg to your midfield
PCQ: Sign Frankie De Jong for CM , Man U wanted him this season but couldn't sign him....Make it
Sid: “I always do a barca career mode so im gonna be different this year” Also Sid: *Does a Man Utd career mode* 🤦‍♂️   Jk i love sids vids but super new career mode
Specky gang, the dreams have come true
ITS LOOKS KINDA WEIRD NGL
Hey sid i think for the attacker you can use oshimen but, if u want to go with a reliable player Goncalo ramos will be perfect
This games graphics looks bad compared to fifa23
Go for Frenkie DeJong, Sid.
When you said good stuff i thought about maguire 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
For The Midfield role I think you should sign someone like Barrela a playmaker who will fit in the playing style
hey sid for the midfield maybe graveberch or valverde
I think you should buy pedri from Barcelona. He is a top class midfielder and will bring your team a support
Camavinga, Pedri or Wirtz at Midfield,  I would go for both Pedri and Camavinga.
1 hour club
Hey Sid for striking positon i thin you should sign victor osimen
Hi Sid love your vids. I think you should give mount a chance he can be really good and I think you should sign Hakimi for the right back role.
Victor Osimen would be perfect for the striker role
You could get someone like Bellingham with a swap deal and lots of money if you have high budget
Bwallllllsacksssssssssssssssssssssssss
For centre mid you could have wirtz
Bro this is literally the same as before   Plus player movement looks horrible   Icl  Not good
Sid sign backup centre back tapsoba good youngster
I think you should sign a midfielder that can defend and also can bring the ball forward so a player like Rabiot who’d be brilliant
For the cm position I think u should sign someone like frenkie de jong he was linked to united for a long time or u could sign nico barela asswel
1 your club
Man U just spent over 200 mil, yet ur going further overboard and spending more and more and not even using the new players they just bought like mount, what kind of a rebuild is this? 😭
i think signing barella woud be  suitable for the team he is good
Marcus Llorente might be aa good addition to the team as his workrate is very high both offensive and defensive. Perfect to be a man u player
For Midfield you should sign Barella or Leon Goretzka. Both are talented and will cos about £70-£80,000,000
for cm role i think Davide fratessi  also fits very well
Jamal Musiala would be a great option for the midfield, forward thinking, lots of pace, can score goals and create chances
Barella is a very nice midfielder and I’d recommend him for you to sign
I think you should sign Leon Goretzka as he is 28 years old so he is not that young which means he wont be so expensive and he would fit the Manchester United playstyle.
PCQ - you don't really need a CM and should have faith in Amrabat but if you need an option then Tchuameni is the one. Sign a Rb instantly and maybe "Gay"turieda or whatever his name is 😂
You should bring in odegard or DE bruyne
PCQ: For the midfield, you could sign Jamal Musiala. He would work really well alongside Bruno Fernandes, and he is very versatile so he would be great for squad depth.
Sid I think you should sign de Paul bc he's won a wc basically in his prime so it would help the team
Sid Maybe get de jong cause was linked
For the striker sign victor osimhen and for midfield sign de jong
Sign for striker Bruno Petković
Pcq: Keep an eye on this new midfielder in eafc sjølund I used him in the beta and he is amazing he's also 87 rated and his contract is expiring. Btw love the content ❤💪
Hi sis I think the best option that will build your team around Bruno so you should think about signing Barrela  gundoan or on the attacking side  marco Veratti
Omg fc24 for united first❤
Signing a ST is absolutely necessary. Martial is not reliable and if Hojlund gets injured....It's a big problem. Sign Benjamin Sesko. He could be the perfect partner and give competition to Hojlund.
Sign goretzka and barella
Maybe you can play a 4 2 4 and sign an experience striker so he can help hojlund on the pitch. Love your videos
For centre half Antonio silva he is young and good for squad depth
Can you pin me pls? I am the first one to ask you. Btw i love ur videos
Amazing Content! I think for the midfield you should sign Milincovic- Savic, Llorente, Rabiot or Frenkie De Jong.                 Keep up the good work Sid!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Cam Neymar ❤❤
Frenkie de Jong for midfield who says no
Maybe try 4-2-3-1 with Amrabat and Casemiro as pivot
Hi Sid, for a midfielder I would consider like Joelinton
Sign an young decent right back and Play ambrabat at cm
I feel like you should get Cristiano Ronaldo as he is experienced and cheap and he might be able to upgrade from the coach also for the midfield you might be able to get kroos as he is a bench player now
Yo sid I think for cm the perfect guy is gonna be Leon goretzka. I just see him as the perfect all round midfielder for the job. Love the videos and goodbye
try signing nicolo barella hes 86 rated or frenkie de jong
Sign barella for cm
For the midfielder role I actually hope you could sign gavi or possibly pedri if they are too much then try barella
his name is not fkn Haaland, pisses me off that you dont even try.
1 hour gang
I think someone like paquta from west ham he will be a good starter and good experience and as a chalenge sighn a Brazilian every season
he's name is not Holland it's hojlund
Do not sell Mount give him a development plan and he is really young so he is going have a great future, and maybe change his position to Lw
United needs good ball carriers so i recommend De Jong
Get Paxten Aaronson And Develop Him as Frankfurt is not playing him Rn
Stop saying oh my g
When you do in Playa career mode
Rodyrgo in real life would never sign for united, especially being the critical key play for Real Madrid, could've kept the 1st signing more realistic.
i like this series plz continue and i can't w8 for 2 nd part
We all know why sid got rid of Antony
RONALDO
Managers manage the team NOT play and control in the game!! Why not watch in tactical view? Watch your team ai vs cpu ai?
Try to spectate the matches to make it more realistic ❤
Instead of Mount get Declan rice,he is younger and he has more talent and he is quite cheap
PCQ: cherki from lyon would be class for that midfield role or bruno guimaraes or mili savic
Sign barrella to replace mount in midfield
I think you should sign Jude Bellingham, Frenkie de Jong and last being Federico Valverde. Nice episode👍
For rb you should sign frimpong a pace demon
Sign Tchoumeni for the CM
The game play looks absolutely dreadful
Maybe get bentancur
Hello I think yu should sign modric becz of he's experience and he's good attacking skills tho he's old
PCQ:you should sign Camavinga
Frenkie De Jong
For the cm position I think you should sign wonderkid gavi also great vid sid
Hey sis don’t worry you’re doing better than man United in real life
PCQ: Elmas from Napoli will be a good choice for CM
Singing son ant make him a cam and brono cm son in 25-35m€
Jude Bellingham......please
Jude Bellingham
I think we should trust rasmus hoijlund and replace mount  We should keep wan bissaka and use facundo pellistry often
For the midfielder sign musiala and kocku
PCQ: Sign Gorteska for the CM spot since he is basically everything and Bayern are looking to replace Gorteska with Palhinha
Is s2g a barca fan?
I think for midfield you should sign llorente for this playing style or play amribat in that position
I love your video's thanks to God that you recommended me as a first video ❤
Omggg😂l❤
u trying to buy alvarez
Harry Maguire
I think you should go for someone like Barella in that midfield when you have the money.
For the cm position you should sign Pedri
For striker I think you can go for Jonathan David or if your looking for experience you can take Olivier giroud
keep Maguire for the memes 😂
Sign caicedo or musiala ❤keep up the good work
Release clause
sign jude
I suggest that you should take maddison, gundogan, ruben neves, or if your looking for a expensive midfielder, get bernando silva or get Ryan Gravenberch.
Hi sid! You should sign llorente
You should sign Alexander Isak
Estupinan (Brighton) could be a good option as a full back, Botman (Newcastle) would be a good option as cb and for midfield, hear me out,  Philippe Coutinho. I bought him from Aston villa in a fifa 23 career mode and he performed amazingly but you are looking for a defensive midefielder and i believe camavinga is the best option, i signed him from real madrid in the same career mode and he performed well as a sub or a starter. He can also work as a full back aswell.
Hey sid, I think you should sign valvade or pedri
PCQ: You could sign Valverde for the midfield. He is young, knows how to attack and how to defend as well. He'll add a lot to the team.
Swap Mason to trent Alexander Arnold
Hey sid , I think you should sign Bellingham, de bruyne or kante for midfield
Hey Sid! I think you should bring Lucas Paqueta or Nkunku For the Midfielder Role, I think They would really adapt to the formation and the style of play you are currently playing In!
Sign Vlahovic and Tchouameni
i think jude bellingham can do the job for your midfield
I hr gang
RightBack: Jeremie Frimpong  Centre Midefilder: Camavinga
Sign jeremie frimpong
For defence i think frimpong de ligt  lamine yamal
You should try gravenberch as he has the potential
Bruno Guimarães Joăo Mario Barella De Jong Gavi Valverde(lasts szn offers from prem teams) Güler
20 likes to start sidinho's career with Real Madrid (sid is a fan of Barca btw😂)
Sid after you have finished this man united career can you pls do a west ham one it would be so cool
Maybe look at the free agents or maybe azzedine ounahi from marseille
You should sign llorente from atleti and also it’s pronounced hoy-land
1:29 Only that Pep is owning Man United in a sweater🔥🔥
Hey Sid! I Think for the midfielder should be Jesper Lindstrøm. I know that he doesn’t have the biggest rating but he do have some great potential.
I think you should sign Verratti, for expierience or if you want a long lasting midfielder then I would sign Locatelli (converting him to CM) or Valverde
Bring cr7 back please
W
For the cm position I feel like someone who can play multiple positions is very good and camivinga is the man when Luke Shaw is gone you can play damaging there and get a better midfielder
For the midfield Goretzka or Barella is two good options
For the CM position, go for someone like Camavinga as there's too many midfielders in Real Madrid and plus he can play CM and CDM and LB
Pcq;please can you bring back press conferences to the channel. It allows us to be more involved in the series
Nicollo Barella is perfect. Attacking and defensively very solid. Great tight space dribbler as this team doesnt have one. Backup options include Goretzka, De Jong, Guimares, Valverde
Man broke the streak💔
The graphic is too bad
Tchouameni
why do you keep transfer window open for the first summer, despite it being updated squads.
Loan out malacia for short term or a year
I think llorente would be perfect replacement for mount   because of that extra pace
This series will be legendary
Add nico Williams
Sid next you should do Middlesbrough as a series. They are not having a good start and you could make them the best team in the world. They have a good squad and are underperfoming as last year they nearly got promoted but are in the realagation zone this year. Like if you agree 👇
Pls sign Sergio Canales
I have an idea YOU CAN BUY GALLAGHER
Hey Sid! why not sign frenkie de jong for cm he’s been linked with man united and is an all round player
Hey sid! Great vid by the way. For a midfield option maybe the uruguayan freddy valverde. The race is on for 1 million subs.
PCQ: Sign Valverde from real Madrid as he has become backup due to Bellingham
SIGN A BETTER RB ARRON WAN BISSAKA YOU SHOULD BRING IN ACHRAF HAKIMI OR MAZZARAOUI
Sid can you play highlights on FC 24?
Sid i think you should sign florian wirtz if you want more attacking power or someone like barella,de paul,guimareas for the box to box role
You should sign Vinicius Jr.! Also shoutout to Edwin :) also sign Bellingham if it lets you, just chuck money at him
Rodri would be a great shout he is 89 rated and won Man City the champions league
Why don’t you replace onana with someone like bonou or Pickford that way you probably won’t concede too much goals
Sid you could play 433 defend with 2 cdm only problem is your team would be more defensive anything else would be good with your play style
Pedri for the cm he is really good and I think he might get better than iniesta
Hey sid one more idea 😂 valverede or akanji
I got the beta but it’s over now
Day 1 for asking S2G to do a west ham fc24 Carrer mode.
For another centre mid, you could sign Florian Wirtz, he has outgrown Leverkusen and is rumoured to leave!
Julian Álvarez is a good striker. Sign him.
Sign a new Right Back
Yesssss
Bring in enzo lee
I feel you should play Amrabat in the first team, he is a new signing irl,  he had such an amazing world cup and you've never played him before.
S2g Fc i want a serie B and A
Can you play with hammarby if?
Sid buy sofyan on permanent or Leon georatka
I think barella  and rafael leao because you can convert rash ford
S2G can you drop your camera settings ?
New era begins
Nicola barella surely he just feels good
1 hour gang
Cb: Bastoni  Cm: musila, valverde
For the Midfield position sign Bruno guimares
Sign Khephrem Thuram. Liverpool wanted him from Nice
AS LIVERPOOL SIGNED FIDGET SPINNER YOU SHOULD SIGN VAN DIJK  OR TRENT FOR REVENGE
buy llorente for mount
LOL
I think for the midfielder you go for enzo furnandez he is young and talented
Sign alvarez and change him to CAM
I suggest if you want a centre mid, you should sign de Jong as man u were interested last season and he is a very balanced midfielder allowing Bruno fenandes to go forward
PCQ: buy Emile Smith Rowe from Arsenal. He’s a neglected player who has tons of potential and is young - he can also play as a number 8
I think you should sign Bernard Silva
Get valverde
Sid you should sign options such as Leon goretzka Federico valverde and maybe even Marcos llorente for the cm role🤩
You should sign frimlong because man United are interested in him in real life also great content sid
In my opinion you should buy Herrera from man city he's a great all round player and pretty cheap
As a midfielder I think you could go for gavi pedri Bellingham or Xavi simons
Hey Sid! For the striker role can you bring back Ronaldo? Imagine all the storylines and memories
Buy kvaratshelia pls
What about luka modric? Maybe he'll win you games
Where is amrabat Edit I didn't see him
Højlund definitely a starter since he can grow more and more and also you have 20:06  if højlund gets injured and probably can chuck garnacho   and play rashford as a striker
this game sucks, looks like fifa 21
Sid buy amarabt from the loan to permanent buy Kane or ohsminen and back up defender todibo
I recommend you sign curtis jones from Liverpool for the midfield and he is young as well
Eayyyy lets go
You should sign jude bellingham
You should buy Declan rice 😂 no hate
In my opinion I would trust rasmus in the striker role and for a new midfielder I would sign douglas Luiz from villa because he's good irl and casemiro will have a fellow Brazilian player
15:24 Excuse me, S2G. His name is not Nordin Amrabat but Sofyan Amrabat.
1 Hour
And for the midfield camavinga
Hey sid! I personally think Valverde would fit this Manchester United team you have built perfectly!
If I were you I’d try to steal kdb from man city
Its hojlund not holland
I think you should buy Toni croos he can have a link up with Casamiro
Get Ronaldo back! He clearly wasn't the problem
Give Rodrygo a good kit number 7 I guess
I think you should trust Hojlund he has very good potential and it will be a waste of money if you go someone else he is the striker you need
You should sign young prospects and loan them out and loan hojlund and garnacho and sign a new striker
Sign someone realistic like Enzo le fee or frenkie de Jong or kheprehn thuram or manu kone
Sign someone realistic like Enzo le fee or frenkie de Jong or kheprehn thuram or manu kone
Barella I think would be a very realistic signing. You’ve got the cash, why not splash it? Please read.
I think you should go for a right back some suggestions are pedro porro or trent
Rasmus didn't score in the first game  but belik from Birmingham city or Kaminski vfl Wolfsburg for midfielder but that rb spot Matty cash and one more midfielder Moses opondo Uganda
For the midfield role you should sign Brahmin Diaz or Barella
Hey sid try try to sign Nicolo barella or zambo anguissa or frenkie de jong
First of all I love this video and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series but for a midfeilder a good option could be Bellingham, listen I know he just signed for real madrid and I know he will cost 180 million but he is the quality you need and since you have the funds I would say go for it but if not I would reccomend going for someone like valverde or Camavinga (yes I know they are real madrid players) but honestly you should do that.
15:13 Hey, it should be Maddison in CM instead of Bentancur because Bentancur is now injury prone and might be not in Ange Postecoglu's Tottenham Hotspur project 2023/2024 season.
Sign frenkie de jong or hakimi they will surely help the team
Mount deserve less hate give hike a chance
For CM I think Orkun Kökcu from feyenoord would be perfect as an allrounder
Valverde will solve all your problems
PCQ: How about try to sign Valvarde? He can play in many roles CM, CDM, RW
Sign Erling Haaland🎊🎉💙
Ok but the way Sid says Højlund messes up my brain (No hate, i absolutely love your videos, it probably only annoys me because im from Denmark)
Sign isak
get Valverde cuz he is fast and strong
Buy cr7 back
I have some ideas for the ST position: You could go with someone like Jonathan David as it would be realistic for him to leave Lille. Tammy Abraham is also a good idea. I love your vids! ❤
for center back position try todibo or de ligt orthe inter milan defender
Hey Sid! the midfield position should be camavinga he can defend pass and attack as well as play in other positions such as lb or cdm
Florian Wirtz will be a good call.  Love the content
Btw its not holland its hoiljund
For the midfield i think kudus is the best
Got a plan for your front three sid, have rashford as striker, buy leao and have leao, rashford and rodrygo as your forward players
Getting De Jong is good because he contributes the defense and ,he was linked last summer
Would love barella or even valverde
Ronaldo
1hour gang👇
Sing nico barlle brahim diaz de jong
Go for Dominik Szoboslai really good midfielder (an absolute machine attacking and defensively also)
Vitor roque
Buy Jeremie Frimpong. And keep Hojlund as the main striker, and buy a more experienced understudy like Taremi.
I will recommend odegaard for the mid
Lewy
Hey sid you should sign llornente because he can play anywhere
You could sign tonali kind of fits for the club and he might be in your budget
Hey sid i Think de Paul would be good because he is a strong and agresive midfielder and he has good control on the ball
EA fc really copied everything from football manager in manager mode
Bring Maguire back.train him with good coach.hes a beast
I think you should buy gavi or tchoumeni
Bro u are just bums at the game
Keep it up
Sign Oshimen or Boniface. These two will be one of the greatest African players of all time. Oshimen was also linked to Man U. for a long time. Really like the content Sid. Keep doing what you're doing.
To get revenge on liverpool try sign Virgil van dijk
Valverde or Jude Bellingham both  good choice
PCQ:sid I think you should sign someone like Enzo Fernández as he is young and could do a better job than Mason mount and plus Enzo will be expensive but you have the money 240 mil and keep up the great work by the way great video👍
why not sign vlahovic for the striker postion
Singh at the right back Jules koundes he is good defending
EAFC
So excited to get eafc 24. Ive pre-ordered it and with it i will also receive a free A league football
Sid you should sign Jerimie frimpong for the rb as he is very young and has great potential 🤩
Liverpool rebuild next ?
Vlahervic
For a striker you should go for Choupo-Moting. Bayern just bought Kane so you can give him some game time he can't get.
Sign tchuameni and convert to cm
Sid you should sign Kevin De Bruyne for you midfield for the next episode
For midfielder i think you can sign odeggard ore barella ore if you want a bigger midfielder you can sign de jong
Sid is the best
I think the team needs another CDM to support Casemiro so I would highly recommend getting a player like Kimmich or Pedri
Whys loris still at spurs
a player for the midfield could be someone like leon goretzka since he can defend and attack and he is cheap
Sid could’ve revived sancho career he’s been disrespected too much
You should sign de Paul
I would say sign midfielder like valverde or maybe Camavinga because they can fit in and sign a right back like jermie fringpong
For midfield I think you should sign Renato Sanches
Sign Jude Bellingham or KDB they are really good midfielders I think they would be great
I think a great option for that CM role would be Frenkie De Jong, he has been linked with Man U IRL in the past but it never went through, I think you should make it happen. He would bring so much quality to that midfield. ( Btw think of Maguire and Eric Dier in defence at Spurs😂😂😂)
maybe sign frimpong for the rb position and he could help with attack from the right alternative could be geertruida if you want a cheaper option
Valverde or Musiala I think would be a great choice, and I'd love to see Ronaldo play as Striker for the club and he will have great experience too. Love your content, keep it up❤
Hi Sid For midfield maybe sign Enzo Fernandez because you could maybe revive his career
in cm role i think tou should sign gallager or bissouma and a player like moukoko or osimhen,marcus thuram for st
sing richalason i
Buy the Italian youngster scalvini and put him In the bench and soon enough he will replace varane,because he is old
make hojlund the main man
St
Sign Evan Ferguson ! :)
For the midfield you should go for Bruno Guimarães from Newcastle. He's a great midfielder and add a bit of that Brazillian flare and will link up with Rodrygo well.
Sign barrela because it a big improvement on mount on eriksen
Defense gavardiol and striker Felix from Barca thx Sid great video ❤❤
hey sid sing in messi
I think its time to upgrade your PC, sometimes its drop FPS
I think with all the money that you have got you should go big and sign jude bellinghem he is really good defensivly and also can start thoes attacks
To be honest it doesn’t look any different to 23😂 see you next oea
Sign Theo Hernandez
we love you sid❤
Try to go St for Osimhen/Gancalo Ramos
SIGN DE BRUYNE EZ😎
I think you should sign Camavinga because you need defensive support he's got high work rates and he's very adaptable
Valverde as he has a lot of experience in wing play
PCQ:You should recall players like pellistri and and you should play more Hannibal Mejbri because him and pellistri have been the best for us at the start of the season
those Graphics look Kinda shit
For a midfielder. Maybe get a young talent from barca. Good video
L for not putting barca tho💀
Keep hojlund is really good
21:17 Why do both teams have 4 Red Cards (Top left, above scoreboard)??
CAM pellegrini
Sign frank de Jong
In case of RB, either Frimpong or Dumfries And CM maybe Verratti, Barella
Camavinga is a good signing cause he is very versatile
You should buy a midfielder like valverde, pedri, de jong or barella.  It's your choice, the guys i mentioned can contribute a lot for the team because they will last many seasons, and they will be class just like they were irl. And i can give you a few suggestions for a rb. You can buy reece james,Achraf Hakimi or Jeremie Frimpong .Fun to watch this Man U video from you . Good luck with your career mode man👍🏻[you can also buy gavi(suggestion by @FlyingRat331) ]
Eh camao camao camavinga🎶🎶🕺🕺🕺
So excited for the new EAFC series. For the CM position sign Sergej Milinković-Savić because he is a good box to box midfielder with attacking abilities. And he will look good in the Man U kit 👍
Sid for the midfielder position I think youngsters like Musiala, Kudus, Zaiyne Emire from PSG or sign Veratti
Hey Sid if you want a CDM you should try kimmich since you want to focus on wing position you should try valverde or camavinga
I subscribed can I have a FC 24
Make garnocho number 7
Sid why don't  you buy Tchoumini since he is not getting game time in real madrid
Dont Call Højlund haaland pronouce right please
HAALAND for Stricker
Pcq : Make Mejbri more and more a starter, he is a baller
Sid could you manage Chelsea thx❤
Sign kdb
For mid sign Enzo because he is young and pritty good
Sup
Petition for Sid to do an Athletico Madrid rebuild 👇
PCQ you should sign someone like Gift Orban and sell martial cause hes a young fast and talented striker
So in midfielder if you really care about future then take lamine yamal. But I think the best option will be to get like pedri, gavi or musiala.  Because u have a lots of many it will be possible
Sign Reece James
You should get Reis from Hamburg, I have used him in many career modes and he can play as both a cam and a cdm
Hi i want to you sine CR7 plss i love you vido
Hi Sid, for a CB if you want a flashly player go for Araujo at Barca, he's had a crazy season. If you're looking for something cheaper, go for Cristiano Romero from Spurs!
Classic one man united
Any1 else notice he said the wrong amrabat😂 this ones sofyan
I bet you’re going to be a legend in fc24 as a manager by the way love your videos S2g
De Paul would easily be the best for that CM role and he will help the team
PCQ: Use the 4-2-3-1 and put amrabat alongside Casemiro or buy a new cdm
Who's holend isn't his name hojlund
Please do a real Madrid takeover for your next episode
rashford ST mitoma LW
U should steal Enzo Fernandez from Chelsea and save his career
trusrt mason mount for the first season
Hey Sid! For the midfielder role I think you should take a look at someone like Gavi, camavinga, or someone young player and about 80 or + players :)
Sign a midfielder , hojlund is younger and better then mount you can sign players like gavi, pedri, bellingham,
1 hour gang whose in?
Keep Antony
You can sign antonio silva as CB
When you said about RW position, I thought about signing Marcus Edwards from Sporting
PCQ : Trust amrabat and play him with Casemiro in a pivot with Bruno as the progressive midfielder with maybe even mount
Get Ronald Araujo
IS THIS A SERIES PLEASE SAY YES
Sign silva
Day 79 of asking for a levante Ud takeover, And s2g I keep up the good work. If it weren’t for you I would be bored eating my dinner and lunch😂
Rasmus Holland😭😭
Why does everybody underestimate wan bissaka the first thing he does is say he wants to get rid of him, disrespect😢
Go for Valverde for CM this season  and then in season 2 or 3 replace Erikson with either Frenkie De Jond or Bellingham. There are plenty of options out there
sign osihmen
Man Utd bought Amrabat so maybe you can play him in a 4-2-3-1 but if you wanna stick to your current tactics then i would suggest to buy Lucas Paqueta coz he is very good .  Also i think that you should buy a winger as squad depth because of the competition you are playing and i think someone like Sterling/Cherki would be absolute great.  Love from India❤❤❤❤
Fc 24 first video!!! Yay
I think you need more defensive midfielder. I think you should buy bruno guimaraes he's young and very talented.
Rodrygo signing so unrealistic. Series already ruined
de jong to be hontest i love yur viedo
Seems like nothing has changed in career mode
Sign Eze, although not the highest rated he will be able to hold good squad depth and have a good shift on the left wing or midfield positions
Convert Mason Mount to a striker and Sign Griezmann, he is good defensively irl and can link up the midfield and give Bruno more freedom... KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!
Sid you should sign Alex Scott for the midfield
I think a great signing would be benacer as he is good defensively
For the striker option I'd suggest somebody more prolific in goal. I'd suggest Inaki Williams cuz u need that pace to penetrate through Premier league defences and if he's pretty low rated play Rashford uptop and sign a lw of ur choice
Skyf Striker Sid Ekse
get leon goretzka he's an amazing midfielder who has the physicality and amazing passing abilities
Sid try the pre match training
Hi SID swap Martial for Adymi hi has speed
“Rasmus Holland”💀😭
Arsenal Carrer Next? ❤
As ur looking for a good midfileder sign warren zyne emery of matteo guendhouzi because they are the future and already have enough expirence to play in premier league
I think Ruben neves would be a good option and bringing him back to Europe would be great for the storyline
Maybe De Jong  he has been associated with Man U before
Hey sid for the midfilder role i think you should buy cammavinga or valverde both are amazing players!
next player for man utd when January 2024 happens maybe the 12th of January recall Greenwood try link up with garncho hojland Greenwood or anything with link up play
jude bellingham will be goof for the mid
I wanted FC Barcelona in EA Sports FC 24 because I love your videos early instead of late but it’s ok to watch Man United career mode.
Bro kept saying haaland it’s højlund
We want Pogba back in Man United 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Maybe get osimhen as he was linked irl for a bit
1 hr gangggg
can you do S2G FC in germanys divisions since you have done one in other major leages
Most of the features are actually not new they are from older games
Like a player career u should be a manager and swap clubs
You Need To Make S2G FC in FC 24
PC:use garnacho more often he is the next Ronaldo
Maybe for the midfielder you could get James Maddison
pcq: you should sign hakimi or frimpong for the rb role over awb
PCQ: you should sign someone like Tchouameni he lacks game time at Real Madrid and he would also help the defence.
Woah
Our boy Sid never disappoints THE BEST!!!
Sign de paul
I think you should let Mount prove himself to the team give him until January and if it does not work out then you should sign a new midfielder
Sign Jeremy doku
For midfielder u could sign valverde or musiala or even pedri
21:18 is it only me or are there 4 red cards for each team that I see on the score board?!
Sign De Jong
Sign Matheus nunes for CM
Sign gnonto he's cheap and young high rated
Hey Sid love the vids already in eafc I think you should sign barella in midfield
Keep Højlund,he’s going to explode with his potential.
next vid fix Chelsea?
I think lucas Paqueter?
If you have enough money, just buy Osimhen as he had been linked the past transfer window
I hour gang
Develop youngsters like pellistri, amad diallo and mainoo aswell as garnacho. They all have decent potential
Why does Hojlund look Japanese 😭😭😭
Bellingham
Next Channel please do Chelsea  on FC24
pov: hey sid love your vids and try signing victor osimhen or mbappe or dusan vlahovic for st position
De jong xavi Simons
When is my player career coming😢
Side u should sign pedri or Frenkie de Jong for the midfield
You should sign Kvaratskhelia as LW and play Rashford as ST. Kvaratskhelia has a lot of potential and his initial rating is 86!
Justice for Maguire
move amrabat to cm and start him and find new LB
Alverz would be fire to steal from man city 😈
Keep hojlund as starter as he is young, has good stats and was bought for a lot of money
bring Sergej Milinković-Savić back to europe
I feel manchester united really need a world class striker to compete against city and liverpool and lautaro martinez would be ur guy and he would excel in the premier league
Sign joushua Kimmich. He is young and a move to United could be good as he is defensive and has excellent passing and leadership
For a backup winger maybe gnonto and for the midfielder serej milinkovic savage or de jong
bellingham,maddison in midfield  would be good
Now I see career mode going on it feels really good to see these videos of yours really big appreciator of your content. I think for the midfiled role you should sign llorente or barella cause they got pace shooting passing defending all stats in one player perfect player for the midfiled or you can go big by signing valverde he can change your whole midfiled.. Love your content...😀😀
i think you need to sign a defensive minded player in that midfield to cover the space with casemiro, maybe someone like kimmich or tchouameni. And for the defence i think you could work to improve the right back position, because awb and dalot is not good enough
Sign cr7
Sign Messi
NICO BARELLA WOULD FIT PERFECTLY, FOR RIGHT BACK SIGN FRIMPONG AND IF YOU NEED ANOTHER STRIKER YOU CAN SIGN CIRO IMMOBILE
Is it just me or did I just notice did wears glasses
Cmon do a liverpool one after 2 to 3 series please. I've been requesting since fifa 20
21:26 bruh Nottingham forest career mode memories 😂💀
I feel like the jong would be a great signing cuz he is rumored do go for man u for a while and he would really fit in do the team and he is young so yeah would be a nice signing😂
Pls can you buy world class midfielder pedri or gave PLS
I think we should get Barella for CM  and Antonio Silva from Benfica 19 and a lot of potential
I think for cm u can sign tcheomeni or Valverde or Kevin de bryne
Let Højlund stay
Try to get de Jong he would be super for utd
de jong 1 billionth time lol
Bring in de Jong and Mazraoui
Do Liverpool next
PCQ: For a midfielder sign Youssuf Fofana he is a solid option that can grow in career mode every season and not that expensive too.
Sign Robin Le Normand from Real Sociedad
Please by Lionel, Messi and Ronaldo
Is lamine Yamal i carrer mode @s2g ?
You should sign Kevin Schade
Sign frenkie de jong he has been linked to United for 2 seasons now,Barca need to sell and expensive player for financial reasons so he is realistic too
you should sign gavi for cm
I think you should sign Joao cancelo or maybe even achraf hakimi for the RB position as they are agile and also have great pace
In my opinion you should sign Lobotka from Napoli, a good midfielder with good physical stat, just makes sense to me
pls make Wan-bissaka a part of the series as he is loved by United fans
PCQ: Keep HOJLUND as a PRIMARY STRIKER at the club, he is like young Haaland from previous FIFAs, so will grow overall rapidly, and insted use money for a better FULL-BACK as your GAMEPLAN is based around them and there arent any world class full backs at United apart from SHAW
U know what will make ur content more interesting be a little more realistic with it like real Madrid will never sell Rodrigo to us in year 2023
Why Not try Gavi or De Paul and Reece James or Lamptey
You should sign a older ST like Immobile for a phew seasons untill Hojlund gets better
I think you should sign Valverde
you should sign a young midfielder with the name Xavi simons he is 79 rated and has 88 potential and cause of his low starting rating he won't be expensive and he has shown intrest in joining the premier league in the past and he is 19
Ronaldooooooo cr7777777 you need to get HIM just himmmm!!!!!!
Sign victor Osimen
I house gang
sign valverde or barella for the cm role
Sign evan ferguson
Sign camaaa oOoOO camavinga
This Game Looks Good But Since Im Poor I Have To Wait For it😢
20:50 and especially 21:52 - this lighting is just ughhh. Hope they'll fix it before the release. At 23:11 it looks like someone turned off all the lights at the stadium at night
i think you should get Gavi or Pedri for the cm position because they are young stars and there are good on the ball.
Great vid Sid🎉  But as a dane i have to say… you have to pronounce the J in Højlund. It’s not pronounced Holland, or maybe try making Google translate pronounce it
Get osimhen
You should sign someone like bentancur, he's good going forward and is decent at defending as well
Sid you should also work up your defense in the Left back position you should get nuno mendes or balde
I hour gang
Can you try and sign like osimhen he was linked to Man Utd and enzo Fernandez
For the cm position I think you should sign pedri RB:Reece James
I think for the midfielder role you can buy Bellingham or Valverde
Bro for st : moukuko (Dortmund) Cm : Veratti 🇮🇹  They are underrated
I think for the midfielder position u should sign fede valverde
Sid you should use amrabat Or valverde
Should go Felix
Strike ronlad
Yo how many adverts u planning on putting on ur vid g
Will you do  best goals in fifa23😊
Hey Sid may be u can sign Jude Bellingham for the midfield role and cancelo or hakimi or frimpong as a RB
Add instructions
BTW (have a look at Mason Greenwood 😂) I think he's back  Love u Sid ❤ Let's push to 1 mili 🎉
Hakimi is good
in mid field you have experienced player just get a young cm maybe someone who plays like scholes such as de jong , camavinga, vitinha
You should sign Orkun Kokcu he’s quick on the ball, insane passing and he’s not so expensive. Keep up the amazing content Sid!
Hey Sid I love your vids and I think you should bring in Trent for the right back role because he will be perfect for your wing play tactics.
sign Joey Veerman, such  a good player
There are many more tactics use that
I reccomended Havertz for the  midfield role
Sign David alaba
Vlahovic as jueve wanna sell him irl
Mount will grow as he is young, get a striker about 30-31 so that Hojlund can grow higher whilst the striker goes down in his OVR
Barcelona pls
Let's go
BELLINGHAM
Sid I reckon you should sign Federico Valverde.He is a very good midfielder plus he has got insane shot power
The fact that the first game was more realistic than real life is lovely. Because Wolves deserved to win that game.. so this is lovely to watch
Gavi is a good
RB NEEDED
I think you should bring ronaldo because he is very good in the 21 22 season and of course CAMAVINGA.
buy messi
The ball knowlegde is shoking!!!😂⚽️
U have many young talents at the club, hojlund is the future so you should get an experienced player cheap due to their age. Maybe strikers like Lewandowski and world class midfielders like Valverde, kdb, pedri could be good
I know that Rasmus hojlund is only 76 rated but give him one whole season.
Keep houjlund as starter and get tchoumeni
You can buy Frenkie De Jong 🔥
sign haaland for  better attacking
Sid buy Camavinga or Tchoumeni for midfield
U should definitely go for camavinga,or de jong as they are very good b2b midfielders
Sid for a midfielder I was thinking a player like Thomas lemar, he was linked to United before his move to atletico a while ago
United spent an entire summer pining for Frankie De Jong, maybe you can lure him away from Barca now that they need money to sign João Felix
Valverde or Barella for CM position should work
21:15 Why does both teams have 4 red cards😂
dead career mode
L sid…you broke the tradition
Maybe buy Frenkie de Jong to control de midfield
you should sign valverde or goretzka for the midfield, would be really nice
U should definitely get a Rb something to experience is hakimi or Kyle walker
For the midfield role you should sign Szoboszlai from Liverpool  or Enzo Fernandez from Chelsea to weaken them. You can also sign someone like Leon Goretska or Gavi or Pedri
Nice content Sid and you should get fofana from Chealse or konate from Liverpool and for the mid field guendouze from latsio
Pls PSG
Bring ronaldo back
This series would be better than the real Manchester United season 😀
Take Bellingham for midfield and for striker take Kolo Muani
Since most of your play revolves around the wings I think you need a ball playing CF how bout Griezmann or Dybala who had a class season with Roma and can also give assist such as Griezmann but I'm choosing Dybala he was class for my career mode
I think someone like goretzka would be good, plus Utd were briefly linked with him in the summer
Hey sid I think you should sign Alex Scott or trust a youth academy player
Yo ❤
For Cm You Should Go For Maybey Gavi Or Camavinga Who can Play Anywhere  For Cb You Should Maybe Sign A Veteran Like Ramos Or A Youngster Like Eric Garcia❤
Okay! your midfield needs a little more creativity so i say, look at Mikel Merino or Leon Goretzka.
8:12
sign anyone but frenkie de jong because he is one of the captains for barcelona
Don't sign a new midfielder  Stick with Amrabat because he will give you more defensive work rate and try to give kobbie maino some chances
i think you can buy zaire emery from psg he is good young and have great potential and you can buy new RB someone like pedro porro
Jeremie Frimpong
Sign barrella or kimich
PCQ: Maybe u can sign David De gea he is free agent can be good for backup andu must sign pedri or gavi u have the money you can also sign bellingham. Love your content. Great Video Sid!
I think for midfield Pedri or Renato Sanches is good
Try to sign Marcos Ray again please ❤❤❤, and i saw how you liked him ❤❤❤in rw or lw
cedric bakambu a good st with a  decent ovr 76 but   with a 81 pace i think he will be very good at the counter attack a he has good shooting
Day eleven if asked s2g to do a 10 session of Newport County please
Early
Oshimen
For the CM position get Joelinton, he's shown what he can do at Newcastle and he will fit perfectly because of that Brazilian link with Casemiro and he'll be the box to box midfield that you need. He's 82 rated and very strong with 88 physical.
Letsss ggoooo
do ajax next !!
Sign mbappe
I think I should get a better left back for Dept
You should keep Hojlund as ur main st and if he does bad get a new st in season 2 and for rb keep wan bissaka as he is a very good rb and let him grow, for cm you could get Gavi, Bennacer or Barella  as they are all good and could fit in the system you play
PCQ: keep hojlund keep an eye on amrabat and sign gravenberch or goretzka
PCQ: in the mid rabiot is a best option and he was rumoured to join man utd
I think for the midfielder’s spot you should sign GAVI he is good
You should play garanacho more so he doesn’t loose potential
Sign Ronnie
Move Bruno to a CM and make mount a CAM
Love you from India❤ For midfielder you can choose Mbeumo Or Gibbs white.
For the striker position sign Jesus or osihmen For the midfielder position sign De Paul or barella thank you for the amazing video
should sign bellingham camavinga or even someone like de bruyne
Sign a city player or a liverpool player
Sign FRIMPONG(RB) AND THURAM(CM)😢😢😢😢PLS
Sign Mac Allister as that cm as a pretty good rating and defence capabilities also you could move Varna go to the RW and play Rodrigo St and or Kim min J as Cb
sign a better cm like mac allister
Jude Bellingham
Or pedri and bellingham
Sign Camavinga.  He is a great squad player.
Or pedri and bellingham
Antoine griezman
Where is movie🤣🤣🤣
For a CM sign puiq his been balling out in the MLS and I sure think he wants his big break ❤ love your Vids by the way ❤
Take the career if an israeli player
Please do man city
For the midfield position, i think you should give Mount another chance or swap deal with Jude Bellingham is kinda sensible signing, also sign Arda guler for future and put him on a development plan. Sell casemiro because he is getting old, selling him & taking the cash or swap deal with Rodri is not a bad idea though
If you need a midfielder get szobozlai
*PCQ: Hello SID pls hear me out* You should sign Dominik Szoboszlai for the midfield role, he has a lot of potential and he is performing also in real life, also love your content
PCQ:If Hojland doesn't preform you should sign kvaratskhelia and make rashford at striker
For striker sign Alexander isak
Doku
you should trust sancho bro im sad for him
The barca career mode was supposed to be first 😢
1 hour gang forever
1 hour gang
How did you get FIFA 24
Camavinga pls or barrella
Wws ea fc worthh it
Not hating buh s2g's career mode videos now just aren't good anymore.  He just jokes around
Rb from Chelsea James
Why he called Højlund for Haaland 💀
PCQ: just buy de jong
Try and sign Gavi for the midfield role as he can track back and defend for the team while also attacking for them
Elanga hitting the griddy hahaha
Can you show us the new boots in ea fc
Sign jude bellingham or mac allister as there are capable of doing madness and they all fit in man united
Before 40.000.LETS GOOO🎉🎉🎉
For the midfield position, casemiro is 31 and bruno is 29, I think you need to sign a young talent because this is a long-term project .   Someone like Camavinga or Enzo fernandes or De jong would be a perfect fit.
Sign Mert Yusuf Torlak, good back up with good potential, sign him now
Pcq: Sid play Amrabat or Eriksen for Mount bcz Amrabat is a good box to box player and eriksen is an established play maker and don’t replace AWB because he is on of the best full backs in the prem. Also don’t forget about greenwood
How early do you have eafc
Let’s goooooooooooooo can’t wait for more
what were those shadows
U should give Rodrygo a better number!
Is this on ps4
24🎉
Musiala would be great
For the midfield role i think you should go with someone like valverde or Barella cause they got UCL expeience and i think they would make the biggest difference
Since Liverpool bought Antony I think u shud buy Mac Alister
pcq: sign gavi for the midfield position he is very good
1 hour gang is here I love your content
I think for midfield you should sign gravenberch from liverpool for revenge
Hey Sid! You can go with de Jong, Bruno Guimaraes or Valverde for the midfielder role...btw love your content
I think you should use the midfielders you have you have mason mount and eriksen i think they are good enough you should buy a solid left back instead. Someone like theo hernandez or something. And if you still wanna go for a midfielder wirtz and lo celso are the only good option because rest all are very unrealistic madrid would never let go off valverde bayern wouldn't let go of musiala and other players like llorente pedri gavi and all is just unrealistic.
Loved it
Tchouameni
Valverde
did bro say rodrygo is a bench player?
For midfielder u can sign Pedri or gavi
Also do a psg carrer mode you haven’t done it
You should sign achraf hakimi
I need that game. You can buy lamine yamal for subs or güler for midfield
Bru why does he get called sid
Please part2
Same game😭
Jude Bellingham or kimmich
Finally
I hour gang
Being a united fan, i will take this as reality atp.
Sid I think you should sign frimpong for the right back role and also you need to try amrabat he is a monster I appreciate your work btw
Can u atleast do a Man City carrer mode because u haven’t done a carrer with city and the goal win a treble or be the best team in England by winning 7 ucls or win the treble
ball glitches
Sid Bro please sign Bellingham...i want to see him in reds atleast on fc24..humble request from a man utd fan
Frenkie would be best.... A versatile midfielder.... Can do attacking and defending...
I think for ST you need someone who I ready for premie League so Osimhen would be a very good signing and for a midfielder I think Tchouameni would be perfect
He said it's a new era ............................................... Ten hag left the chat
Sid, You should sign Ward Prowse
Valverde would be perfect
for the cm spot sign leon gore goretzka he will fit there and hes a very good player, and for the RB sing Hakimi, hes maybe wiling to leave PSG so you can sign him
Pcq: You should go for a standard midfield choice like daichi kamada
U should start hojlund as he is young and dangerous in the box and sign robin gosens and sell dalot
PCQ: For the midfield: Mount wants to go back to Chelsea so swap deal for Enzo and for striker bring Taremi on a short term
i think valverde would be the best fit for the team
Blud said Jordan Amrabat
Get thuram the cm
you should sign Marco verrati. he will provide support to bruno, and also he wants to leave psg.
Can wait for the player career modes 🔥🔥
Me
Sign Declan rice rice in midfield will be crazy
As the budget is not a problem you should try signing Vitinha . I saw him play very good in his last champions league match .  You should try him
No not fofana mbappe
PCT:Sign Julian Alvarez for st
I started watching you two years back and then stoped im glad your on my fyp again Keep up the good work sid
Hey sid i think you should get a new cm maybe you can go for mac allister he is a great defensive and offensive player. Keep up the great content
fdj bring him now
Do brihton
Do swap deal with mount and Bellingham
Change Garnachos number to 7 mount DOESNT deserve it
Pcq: sign adeyemi he is mad quick and I think will be good for the club
Cr7 or mbappe or neymar . Kevin de bruyne sign them please
Don’t sign a striker
Hey Sid! I think for the st position there’s only one man all of us think about, It’s Cristiano Ronaldo how about you get him a better experience at united?
Sing manor Solomon az a Beck up
Xavi Simons MF
PCQ : Sign Victor osimhen for the striker position and sign and make amrabat a starter
Sign up Dani olmo and Kimmel
Hey Sid! I like for midfielder to say frenkie de jong
Can u replace casemiro from CDM to rodri. Casemiro is getting old now and I don't think he will do more. So, it's my opinion tho😅 and casemiro as CM
You should bring back Ronaldo to Man United
Sign Sandro tonali
Sign Madison and turn him into midfielder with development plans
Sid should buy valverde
Barella is going to improve united midfield
PCQ: for the new midfielder try sign  Nico Barella or Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen or even consider Fede Valverde as Madrids midfield is getting packed. Depending on their overall and potential Riqui Puig and Thiago Almada have been killing it in MLS so could be an option as well
Hey sid, already a great series. Maybe for cm you can sign Kokcu from Benfica not too expensive and great potential
Get Bellingham and haaland or like a top talent like Anthony Davies and vini and more
For Mount, sign Mo Kudus, he is a really versatile player in real life that can play in the RW, CAM, and ST/CF position if you wanted him to, he's also got sick moves which will be crucial in order to cut through opponent defenses!
you said you need cover in the midfield sid, camavingas got you covered money shouldnt be a problem and hes still pretty young so i dont see why not to sign him or someone simmilar if money does become a probleme ryan gravenberch might be one for the future as he still has great potential
59 min lesss goo
Pcq:You should sign isak for the st position inigo martinez for back up cb and marcos llorente for cm position
I think Nico barbella would work. He's can play in any part of that midfield
Sign Kai Havertz. Give him a revenge arc, I know I know he is bad but, still just give a try he might prove us wrong.
for center mid you should sign nico barrela and for center back kloosterman or mikey van de ven as they are very quick as will also help a lot in defense as substitute
You should sign gavi as he is young and have a lot of talent
sign de jong or goretzka in the midfield
pcq : i think u should sign felix for the ST position as the next ronaldo he has the talent plus he got the experience of premiere league before.
Thoughts on singing Chiesa?
Day 3 of asking Sid to make a South African team
Just now gang
PCQ: For the new midfielder you should sign Nicolo Barella he’s 27 plays for Inter Milan and had a great season for Inter in the Champions League last season!
1 hour gang, like -->
u can add a good midfielder like verati and for striker u can add victor oshimen
I think for st sing young prospect Šeško
Hey sid plz learn how to pronounce Ramus Højlunds name
You did the angry ginge mistake by thinking it’s Nordin Amrabat it’s Sofyan Amrabat
Jude bellingham signing button
Sign Ronaldo To his home
The first loss was on purpose clearly 😂
I’m a United fan so this makes me really happy especially with what I think is the best for career mode Youtuber
To the midfield I think you should sign Dominik Szoboszlai from Liverpool. He is 82 rated CAM, but he's int the defense and in the attack as well
Sign the 38 year old Ronaldo😢
Build around Bruno? Sell the noob
trust højlund he is fast and really strong so i think he will be good for you
Hi Sid please buy barella
With Kane gone we need to see a Tottenham career mode
please learn to say hojlunds name the right way
I think bringing in Enzo Fernández might be the right move  He is struggling in Chelsea and he is not happy about his club's situation and he is one of the world's best midfielders
pcq: i think someone like oliver skipp would be an amazing signing for that midfield. hes got pace, and casemiro definitely needs support which skipp definitely can deliver.
Can we get Liverpool one with the new signings and that with the return to the best of the reds
Maybe Marquinhos from psg
Sid always exposes his low ball knowledge 💀
You should bring in Ryan Gravenberch as a good young midfielder with lots of potential
Hey Sid, I think you should sign Frankie De jong for the midfield position
U should play more of amrabat and casemiro
Yes I'm in the 1 hour
sign de jong because united wanted him irl
1hr gang
Thank you sid for this amazing vidéo for the MC position you need to sign pedri , he is a young player and he have amazing potentiel
suiii
For a cm you can go for marcos llorente as he is fast, versatile and can play in any position. I also believe you should sign a left back like ferland mendy who  has pace as Luke shaw can be a weak link and he can fit your style of play
sign todibo to replace maguire
Someone who was also linked to ManU this window was Leon goretzka and I think he would be able to give you the physical you need and his stats are generally eye watering
S2G: They were so many rumours about Frankie de Jong to Man Utd in the past but it never happened so please make it happen 🙏
You should sign someone like adyemi for ST position
NICE!!!
Bro can you sign todibo plsss
Better RB is needed I think dumfries or foyth to world class RB and they have room to grow
Camavinga is the best option
keep hojlund sell mount keep an eye on amrabat
Buy as striker is fofana the next drogba
Maybe sign a player like osihmen as an world class striker and have a hojlund as a younger back up, this would mean getting rid of martial and in turn bringing in a young 88 rated striker.
Sign Frenkie de Jong for Midfield. He is ridiculously good.... Also Ten Hag and United wanted him previously.
sign someone like cunha he is gonna be a beast
I'm so excited to see the new game
Nah man, this just doesn’t feel right   It always started with Barca 😢, you broke a 7 year streak
Sigh Diogo Jota as A St He can also be used as Cf LW. he has pace and dribbling sign szobozlai
Midtable mandem
1 hour gang
Sid sign Pavard from Bayern for that right back position it would have happened in real life
Midfielder
1 hour gang
A realistic signing would be leon goretzka as he was linked to the club during the transfer window
sign Leon goretzka from bayern
Pcq: Sign valverde for cm cuz u have the budget and he helps to in offence and defence
I think you should sign koke or De jong
Sid you can sign these players Bellingham,pedri,Gavi,muisiala
Sign victor osimhen for striker role
Lestssss gooo
Rodyrgo being a 85 rated player....he should be a 81 or 82 at best
Buy jude bellingham because hes 86 rated 20 years old probably valued 120 million he would be a great signing make it happen
First
Make Garnachco bettterrrrrr
Sign Camavinga for the memes!😂😂😂
You should get bellingham
TRY AND SIGN VICTOR OSIMHEN AS YOUR STRIKER. He'll be a good asset
You can sign osimhen hes so good has pace and always got the headers, as i signed him in last fifa career. Hes a solid choice for main striker
Sign OSIMHEN
Phenomenal as always Sid, why don't you do a Spurs career mode next at least you dust out their trophy cabinet🤣🤣
I think signing someone from Dortmund would be amazing for replacing the failed sancho, he’s the only one that had a bad career coming out of dortmund. Since you need a cm I would suggest Julian Brandt, he’s relatively strong and has incredible stats in this game and could really improve your midfield not just for now but also the future. And since Dortmund is a build up squad it could be a realistic signing. Love the series already Sid
1 hour gang >>>>>
amazing video
Don't buy a striker transform rasmus hojlund to the best of the besr
Bellingham
To make this save a bit challenging you can put on some restrictions-  1. Increase injury frequency as they are very common in real games. 2. Man utd transfer policy is very bad. So you can only buy 1 superstar signing, 2 young players below age of 23 and a 30+ player
For cm I feel like someone like nico barella fits this style of play with his playmaking skills and sometimes on the wing ready to whip the ball in
For cm I feel like someone like nico barella fits this style of play with his playmaking skills and sometimes on the wing ready to whip the ball in
1 hour boys are real
Maybe sidhono could make a return 😂
Bro sign Jude Bellingham, Enzo Fernandez or fedrico valverde plz sign any one because they all have potential to become superstar
So did every other creator got the game 😂😂
Plzz sign Ronaldo
Can you do ultimate team as well
plzz sign messi nxt
1 hour gang
Can you make garnacho start more
Harry Kane isn't a bad option he's not that cheap but he gets the job done and paired with bruno fernandes it's a duo come true
I hour gang please leave like
Cm u should get is RUBEN neves
I where specks to sid
I think you should sign Bruno Guimaraes to be a perfect fit for that box to box role. The two Bruno’s in midfield with Casemiro.
Finally
SPURS: Maguire and Lenglet
Is create a club career mode still available?
Bellingham
Please do a Man City career mode
Sid missed with Mount on purpose. He just wanted a reason to replace him, because who chips the goalkeeper when they're that close🤦🏽‍♂️  Play Mount as CAM and Bruno as CM in one game. We've seen in your previous Chelsea career mode that Mount is better at CAM
1hr gang here
Sign de jong or barrela as they were linked to man united at some point or go crazy and sign bellingham or pedri
Plz tell me I ain’t the only one who think that manager face resembles Chris Evans? 🤔
Bring back Cristiano Ronaldo pls.. give him better career ending please 😢
PCQ : You should buy a young player like Pedri or maybe Gavi because Pedri is expensive for midfield you choose.
For the CM position i think a good option would be Cheick Doucoure, very solid player, good at getting forward and good defensively, cpuld be useful on helping the attack while also strengthening that backline
Sid you don’t need a midfielder as you have amarabat. Convert him into a CM and trust him
Come on sid we need a Barca series soon
You should sign De Jong
Instead going for a new midfielder I guess u should probably look for a better rb. You should sign hakimi because he has a good pace and he also suits your tactics of wing play. He is the perfect player, he will also create many chances for ur team.
Let hojlund play as he is damn talented plzzz dont sign a new st or if u do like a substitute for hojlund plzzzz
bro thinks he is bad saying specs💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Day 3 of asking for a Swindon Town rebuild
Can you please sign my boy inaki Williams from Athletic Bilbao
sign ben yedder. he’ll be good for a few seasons which is just enough time for rasmus to get good
Valverde perfect midfield
You should sign Barella
buy hakimi for that rb role he would fit perfectly
I mean ik this is not the official release or the final release but this gameplay is not even feeling that much different from 22 or 23, not hating jus stating an opinion
You can sign Frenkie De Jong as everyone know that he was a target earlier seasons
Sign camavinga or Enzo Fernandez
I think you need to sign fede velverde in midfield
sign bellingham
Buy Wilfred Ndidi or Maddison
21:17 why r there 4 red cards for each teamm
Buy Xavi Simon's for the midfield and make mount a starter
1 hour gang
Sid i had a suggestion, you see last time you made a video "I manage Barcelona-Full movie" right, so how about this time manage United full movie
U should sign Ivan Toney as ur new cf
I think u should sign Kimmich or pedri as the are young and more defensive but also the problem is the money factor,so if you are lacking in money them u should buy enzho Fernandes which will also weaken your opponent ❤❤
You should buy Word-prowse or guler from real madrid
thank u
PCQ: for the cm role I think you should sign joshua kimmch he has the mentality of a defensive midfielder and can help casemiro when needed and hes also very versatile
Pcq-- sid Sign trent from Liverpool convert him into cm and take revenge for signing Antony.. It's a win win.
Sid I think u should sign Llorente or Frankie De Jong
You’re saying Højlund very wrong, it’s more like hauy-lu-nh edit: in fact you say højlund exactly how you should say haaland
Soler
The best
I think u should sign odegaard or rodri
I wanted you to show us the whole stuffs inside Fifa 24
You can sign Barela
Bro you have so enough money to buy Jude Bellingham
Pedri is a great one
Sign for the midfield position Frenkie de Jong, because irl United wanted to buy Frenkie
Sid you should get Barrella from Inter to weaken them and I think he would click well
Please Sid make the career mode long don't rush it
Sign sesko or Ferguson as a back up to højlund
Valverde from REAL MADRID let's get him to 850K
sign valverde
if ihad to pick a rightwinger it will be AKARA MESSI 🐐
sign Maddison from Spurs he is worth it
Sign mbappe please
sign lautaro martinez that guy is hella talented and is great in a wing playstyle.❤
enzo franades
Martial needs to go and replace him with Jonathan David. CB Suggestions Antonio Silva/Tapsoba. Mid Kokcu!!!
Sod
Nahhh this man is honestly js amazing
For the midfield position you should go for Vithnia or sign someone more experience like Milinkovic Savic or ruben Neves
You should bring Lukaku back to give Hojlund room to develp and next season he will be a starter.
for the midfirlder spot you should really sign someone big with the buget you have got like pedri/gavi/camavinga/bellingham/musiala
Sign matteus nunez from man city great box2box who can score defend and also ballance the midfield
PCQ : trust amrabat also you can change the tactic to a 4-2-3-1 so you can put him alongside casemiro as that is how ten hag is going to play in the next few games , maybe you could do with a right winger depth like orayazabal or kvara if you wanna go crazy with it
Sid you can sign bruno G or Camvinga for your team . You can probably convert lavia into a CM he can make those runs keep up with the great work ❤❤
Love you s2g
Idk if this because of video but i feel the pitch isn't blending with the players
midfielders for you sid you can sign barella or gavi or de jong pls sign one of them
Don't change hojlund. They paid 80m for him. U should keep it realistic. Give him at least a season
For the striker a realistic option would be Jonathan David
Please do a rennes career mode next
Bro Fc 24...... Is godly 🔥🔥
Bro sign vlahoic Or dybala
Midfielder -  gavi or pedri ,striker -
keep hojlund as he has big potential and as for mount you may sign someone like de jong
Amazing video as allways. I think the midfielder I would sign is Nicolas Barella from Inter :)
Buy de gea back to man united he free in the new game 🎮
Letszzz goo ❤
For the midfield position i think Arda Guler will be a good choice, he is young, lot to grow & it will be a long term deal. Otherwise, Bellingham, Pedri, Gavi, Camavinga, Musiala etc... because money is not a problem
Ugarte and ricci
Hi S2G for the midfieder i advice you to buy Writz
Yessss
Sign odegaard or Valverde
1 hour gang what a  video ur the goat of career mode

You should sign valverde as your new midfielder 😊😊
Yoooooo let’s goooooo FC 24
hey sid!I think at mid-feild you should add bellingham,valverde or de pual and replace mount also I love you content
Nsisbs
Noo hell no Man utd
I tink you shuld sine frim pong
Sid, why you so good?
Maguire not even in Bench for Spurs 🤔??
Bennacer is 84 Rated with 80 pace and would be perfect for the team. He is a CDM by default but with 80 pace he would be a great box to box Midfielder and give Casemiro the support he needs Defensively.
What are some gameplay differences from fifa 23?
Once you start takeovers in FC 24, could you do a Crystal Palace one? Love the videos Sid
Pcq: de paul can be an engine in midfield if you want creativity with it than paqueta is a great option
Fc 24 early 🧢🧢🧢
sign evan ferguson
Less go ea fc is here.
1 hr gang
Maybe sending Rasmus on loan for 1 or 2 season and sign a highly rated 30 plus striker might to be cool. And Rasmus can develop a lot
Please start amrabat over mason mount Im morroccan 🇲🇦
Sid is the best manager in the world ❤🦾
try using Julian alveras he's young and has a bunch of potential plus he already completed football
PCQ: I recommend you the signing of Thuram, Kone or Marcos Llorente in the midfield
Unrealistic signing as always 😪😪
Omg here we go again with scripted contents he planed how he's gonna play did u saw that chance with Mount he almost went into goalkeeper's mouth and he tried to cheeky finish just to get him off omg thumbs down 100% not a real player 👎👎👎👎
P.C.Q: I think Mac Allister  would be a option. Cause Liverpool has taken Antony. It would be a revenge.
Use martial and hojlund for season one. Then sign Victor Osimhen in the summer
How about sign camavinga he is a really suitable player to be a box to box player to dictate the midfield
Please sign Brian Brobbey from Ajax for the striker position! Love the vids, Sid!
nice video
2:42 as a united fan we’re literally counter attack fc😂😂
I think you need to sign gavi for the midfield since he is now 83 rated and not too expensive
Finally, finally, S2g you have done a great job by rebuilding Man Utd.
Hojlund gonna be star!
Buy Leon Goretzka
PCQ: Sign valverde for cm spot
The game actually looks much better, I guess EA spent that FIFA fee on improving the game instead...
Of course the first career mode is GONNA BE FIRE💥😍
Play rashford striker and Garnacho on the left wing and let him grow
How did you get it Wednesday ? I precommanded it and its until Friday.
Sign Frenkie De Jong
dhoka de diya mujhe. Barca ka save na karke
Buy fede valverde and loan out Rasmus Hojland and buy moukoko
Pablo Gavi
The amount of Barcelona videos are there in this channel, I thought first EA FC 24 video will be a Barcelona Video😅
PCQ:sign Nicolò Barella he’s a balanced player in all stats and he will fit the system
PCQ:I think a midfielder like James WardProwse is what you need...He can be the chain between Bruno and Casmeiro+He is really good with free kicks
I think it would be good for you to sign Rúben Neves. He's 26 years old 84 ovr playing definsive exactly what you need. Keep going🎉
may be searching the young academy is good
Valverde , gavi , pedri , bellimgam
Hi sid . For the midfield position you shoud sign someone like Rodrigo Bentancur or joelinton and someone like Iniago Martinez for Defence (backup)
PCQ: for the CM position sing Frenkie De Jong he is going to be perfect he has defensive ability he is a great box to box player and was rumored to united for a while
Sid for the midfield sign Jude B from real madrid
cm i would get goretzka
Pls 😢Do it with PSG
sihn santi gimenz he young too and a st
Sign pedri please❤
21:14   4 red cards per team, what’s going on here 😂😂😂

For midfielder I think you should sign Gavi or Tonali ❤❤
You better sign next is new RB Alexander Arnold or Hakimi

this career mode will be there in mobile as well or not??
Pls singen arda Güler
Hey sid, I think you should sign de Paul,Valverde or marcos llorente for the cm position and love your vids keep up the hard work
Like for goncalo ramos (benfica)
PCQ: Sid you got the money, bring in Frenkie de Jong
Love the videos❤❤
sign hakimi as a RB he is a monster in rb position a
Arda Güler
maybe frankie de jong for your midfield
Arda
why not Xavi Simons so he takes the step up from PSV or  Florian Wirtz
Arda
PCQ: For the midfeild you need Valverde and you need a better RB
Not sure if y'all saw or not but they got the official matches and in order as well
When is the Sid player cream mode
bellingam
For the midfielder position, try signing Camavinga or Tchouameni, and if the right back is necessary, trade in Wan-Bissaka or Dalot for Frimpong
Vitinha from PSG sounds like a fun midfielder for man utd. Or maybe you could just go crazy and sign valverde or even pedri
sign diomande for the center back position. very young with great upside
This is gonna be a great season sid
I wanted it to be realistic and the first signing already was super unrealistic :/
Give a chance to amrabat he's class
Sign acuña and convert him to a CM, he's defensive, agile, has a great passing, all to be a perfect CM
sign Thuram or lorente for the midfielder position
MU is cursed bro just use barcelona or arsenal they are on fire🔥
For the midfield position sign Valverde or guimaraes
Try signing de bruyne or de Jong
the griddy tho!
Buy as midfielder joelinton
40min gang
Julian Alvarez
Sign either gravenberch or hojberg for midfield for revenge against Liverpool and they are also rumoured
buy frankie de jong,he has wasted his career in barca.try saving him
wow im early and pls pin
U need Bruno G from newcastle
I feel like in FC24, you should go back to your old traditional, a full series on MoreS2G, maybe mixing in some ultimate team content, and just do career mode series like 5/7 times a week and do Fixing Friday
manchester united are turning into chelsea rn ngl
For the midfield role I think you should sign valverde because I think he is the hard worker in the midfield that you are looking for
Yes
You need a better rb
Wait till 100000 Barcelona career mode video will come 😂
If ronaldo was still there this would be a different story but no disrespect to man utd
PCQ: Sign Nicolas Dominguez As in the game against nottingham he was class for them and he wont be that expensive with room to grow well being only 25
PCQ: Backup CB: Giannis Koulierakis. Youngster. Low OVR, 83+ Potential Backup ST: Chuba Akpom. Experienced, similar OVR to Hojlund. Cheap. CM: i aint got no clue
Your manager looks like a eusebio Di Francesco
Since you have Bruno and casemiro I think you need a box 2 box midfielder maybe: Thuram  De Paul Barela  Anguisa
pcq: you can check the players that are out on loan and recall them if you need to
Pls takeover liverpool❤
PCQ: Hey Sid, I think you should buy Victor Oshimen from napoli and mabye you shoudl get Xavi Simons in the midfeild. Anyways I love your work keep it up!!!
make a juvetus career and buy dybala and develop him until he retiers
I'm early!!!
For defender sign Hakimi or Alphonso Davies
Bring mbappe We will see haaland vs mbappe rivalry
Heyyy sid , I see your video for a very long time , and you almost used many midfielders in your  videos So, I want the first time you used “Mikel Merino” from the first time.
36 minnutes
Its sofyan amarbat not nordin
1 hour gang 👇🏿
nah sid why you signing Rodrygo, that is not realistic
You should sign Trent Alexander Arnold even though he is not good at defending
Hey sid my name is sid as well and tommorw is my birthday and I would like if u could see this message and I want u to sign Manu kone for ur midfielder  option
Of you Need a full back buy Mazraoui he played for ten hag at ajax
Why the name in the kit is straight, it should be curved.
Or de jong
Cmon new Season and New Fifa Sorry i mean EA FC Excited to see The content And Man UTD playing under sid atleast better Than Ten hag
you should sign nicolo barela he is very good and fits the play
feels illegal to be this early
Jude Bellingham
what about benzema or  but for Ronaldo  a comeback? for the good ending. In the midfield mount to cm
For cm u should sign Gavi
Day 16 of asking for Leroy sane career fix
They got the real prem fixtures as well? Beacuse i have been waiting for this for a long time
You should buy Federico Valverde. He isn't getting a lot of game time with Modrić Kroos and Bellingham. I think de Jong is also a good idea because man u have been trying to get him for a long time also since you said Bruno Fernandes is not very defensive while Frenkie is
Sigh Barella love the vids btw sid.
I think a player like rabiot or bentancur would be a great addition to the midfield and maybe Dumfries as the fullback you need. Also, i think you should play Eriksen more. I know he's not the ideal player for a career mode but you never know
Try to sign ruben neves if he not that expensive
PCQ : Hello Sid, There are some midfielders I prefer that you should sign. They are : Pedri, Gavi, Rodri (so this will make Man City weak). Or you can sign Bellingham who just joined Madrid😂. Also I think you should sell Anthony Martial and sign a veteran striker so Højlund will have the room to grow and will also get rest. I also prefer to sign a World Class Right-Back cuz u have got the money. Anyways, Love from Bangladesh❤
Sign pedri
Let's go man thats cool that we can decide the transfer Bellingham plssssssssssss
1 hour gang 👇
need a CB and an actual CM, both for depth
For the midfield you should sign de jong
i think frenkie de jong would be great. been linked to united in the past. he has consisten performance. Sign Frenkie De Jong.
Not Barcelona 😢
For a midfielder you should sign Leon goretzka for the experience, plenty of Bundesligas and even a champions league!
👀
I think a RB should be placed. I think Jeremy Frimpong
30 minute gang 👇

Buy Virgil van dijk
Stricker
Sid sign wirtz, hes world class and a great midfielder for manu, hes also young too!!!
Yes it is good early access sid is the best

Goretzka will be a great singing as he is good in defending transition and as well as chance creation
Mount is finished, sign Barella or Bruno Guimaraes
bring osimhen
I think u need to play wingers further forward
If I had to pick one I’d say upgrade with an older ST. I do think you should try to use both though until January as they were both purchased this summer. Excited for this series no matter what though!
1st vid of fc 24!!

Bro your careermode,s always make me happy keep up the good work❤
1hour gang can't wait to player carrer mode and more of this😇
Sid sign pedri
Play the matches as manager camera dont play that would be more entertaining
PCQ: I think you should sign Enzo Fernandes cuz of his performance in the World Cup and becuz he is one of the top talents in the midfield area
Ing in bellingham
RB=frimpong  CB=ramos for experience or tapsob n maybe u can loan kubo
The formation you using is allowing Mount and Bruno to focus on staying upfield instead of helping Casemiro. I'd say play with CDM, CM and CAM
Glory Glory Man utd!!❤❤
Go for osimhen sid
I think the Midfielder is martin odegard like you vids
Cabell CM
Ok my choice for a cm who can do defensive work is valvarde or de jong I think money is not a problem there
You should sign nketiah coz he is a young striker yet to improve
1 hour gang 👇
Go for Jonathan David or Randal kolomuani u have never used him
Train before matches bro it will give your players extra boost for the match
Llorente a very good box to box midfielder with a good rating

Buy Camavinga. He'll be the best replacement
You should buy Bruno Guimaraes he has great potential and he is perfect in man utd midfield
Also buy frinpong for RB
Fc 24 looks crazy!!!! Thanks for the early view siddd❤❤
EA FC is cool
@S2G go for enzo fernandez or bellingham they are best, if you want stronger cm go for de paul
It would be sick if EA made a referee career mode.
PCQ: Bring Camavinga, he is good in mid field, can go in left back, can also go in CAM, And into goalkeeper to.
Lionel Messi 👍 Sg2 🐐

LETS GO SID KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!
could i get a comment from the king?
Sign jreeme frimpong
If you aren't keeping it realistic, then sign Mbappe, if you are keeping it realistic, then sign Dusan Vlahovic or Lautaro Martinez. Vlahovic has kinda ruined his career and Lautaro has come off a brilliant season winning the world cup and reaching the champions league final with Inter Milan. And Mbappe is Mbappe
You could do more pasing than skill move knocking the ball makes it more better for your type of play and the chip shot ain't working for you sing Romeo Livia
Sign Neymar and change him to a CF He is op there
PCQ: you should buy iago aspas his old ik but he still have 1 or 2 good years. for a midflider you should buy frenike de jong, i think he would fit perfectly in the team also manor solomon he is young and not that expensive and his good for dept
Hi Sid amazing content hopefully you can bring back the glory days to United for the midfield I think you should sign Eduardo Camavinga, Fede Valverde or Joshua Kimmich and if Rashy underperformes sign Kricha(apologies if I spelt his name wrong😅) from Napoli
I think that osimhen would be a good signing for the the striker role. Because in real life he is doing really well for Napoli
Hello S2G for the midfield you can get gavi,llorente,barella and kimmich to improve the midfield
James Word prowse for midfield would be awesome ❤❤ He is a world class deadball specialist who is also in great form for westham in real life

Dea jong or cammavinga are also good
PCQ: sign Jamal Musiala he’s quick and helped Bayern to win the bundesliga
I think de jong or xavi simons
Hey S2G I want you to sign a new Rb so maybe trent because liverpool took antony from you
The shadows and lighting are so bad

Hey Sid! For the midfielder role I think you should take a look at someone like Llorente, Barella, De Paul or even Valverde as I think they would fit in very well. Great video!
Sign Valverde
For the cm position i think you should sign  valverde he is good in every aspect
Damn, can't believe I'm this early tho
Sign the most awaited player for utd fdj or u can go for enzo also , if u want some under the radar player then go for orkun kokcu
cmon liverpool
PCQ: play 4-2-3-1 so Amrabat and Casemiro can play next to each other with Bruno, Eriksen and mount rotating for CAM
Sign Frankie De Jong we like to see him in as a United
In my opinion you should buy goreska and he is from bayern and bayern is in your group no swap deal  only money deal for goreska
Sign a big playmaker like Frenkie De Jong or Leon Goretzska
Side you should sign Enzo he's got talent and the passing ability
Please became Liverpool manager
For the midfield let amrabat play
Its not Nordin Amrabat its Sofyan Amrabat just to tell you  Keep up the good work tho Sid
Sid don’t forget development plans for all players
Lets Go Sid,Finally EA FC 24 Video !I Hope This Series Is A Banger !🔥 Signing Idea : For CM Maybe Sign Florian Wirtz Or Pablo Gavi
Sid Sid Sid , definitely bring in de jong from Barcelona to fill in that midfield role 😊
something like pedri would also be awesome for the mason spot since you have money$
Put on developmental plan on everyone to accelerate the team’s growth with the training coaching it will help alot
PCQ; I think you shouldnt sign a new striker as hojluand is young and he has great potential plus it kinda would ruin if hojlaund was signed for 100 million and latter he is benched. Put your trust in the lad
Sign Phil foden and convert to cm and you will also weak Man city
I think you need to play Diogo Dalot over Wan-bissaka.. Ps: love the content Sid keep it up bro!!🙌🙌
Buying rodrygo is the most unrealistic thing ever😂😂😂
Maybe sign pedri or gavi they wiuld be fun to use
BUY  GAVI
Now you have EA FC 2024 you better be posting often!
1 hour people
21:16 Why do both teams have 4 red cards?
You should buy martin Ødegaard
You should keep Rasmus as the striker...
Sign tchoumeni for the midfield
Viva Ronaldo!
Sid op loved your series
Frenkie de Jong or  xavi simmons
I think you should sign victor osihmen because he's a good fit for united, and he was somewhat linked to united IRL. Osihmen would be lovely and for the midfielder position, I think you should sign wirtz or palacios from Leverkusen
Thank you Sid, for all of your A-MA-ZING videos!
pls do liverpool next
Specs2G
Ronaldo back to man unt
PCQ: Hey Sid, Sign Goretzka for the midfield position he is very strong, and he is a box to box midfielder as well. 🇩🇪
i think u should buy julian Alvarez. He is young and also has a great potential  Love your vids, keep doing the good work👋
You should sign Ilkay Gündogan
Manchester United Re-signed Cristiano RONALDO
1 hour gang 👇🏻
Maybe like pedri he is a great talent and very good 👍
Under 1hr gang here!  (Comment to get your ticket/spot)
Sid you should sign some box to box midfielder and a Backup Winger
For the midfielder you need a workhorse next to casemiro maybe rodrigo de Paul or Davide frattesi
Change Rodrygo number
PCQ : please sign me boss . Pep prefers messi over me as the ballon d'or winner .
I'd say sign oshimen and get some African talent in there
Sign Valverde for the midfield
Yo the Antony slander is ridiculous
Midfielder is ryan gravenberch
Mid KDB
Add Gabi
De bruyne
Claim you 8 minutes tickets here
Excited for this
PCQ - Replacing mount with someone like B. Guimaraes or Gavi would be phenomenal
Sign Camavinga for the cm position
you can buy thuram or almada
Give hojlund half a season then you can buy a striker
pcq: its wild but I want u to sign jude bellingham😂
These comment sections are so npc
You should sign frenkie de jong
Sid has become the biggest højlund fan
PCQ: for the midfield position, get de jong because United really want him
PCQ: Hey Sid i think you should let hojlund prove himself before you make the decision to get a striker
for the midfielder position try to sign someone like florian wirtz or gavi and for the rb position I suggest u buy frimpong or dest and for the st position I suggest you buy kolo muani or bring bavk ronaldo or u could but goncalo ramos
Honestly I feel like The graphics with this New EA FC 24 is a bit meh.
Sign Gavi he is a good player and let Garnacho play more❤🎉😊🎉😊❤
Hey sid for the midfield sign Camavinga and play him as a CM good luck!
I think you should check the free agents, there are some great players out there
I was a tester for this game for switch though it is a good game.
Sid i think you should sign Ludovic Ajorque. He gives great veteran talent for the club and as he gets older his pace seems to be unreal. Rasmus could really learn something from him
Pcq: I fell like buying camavinga for the midfield will be perfect and he will probably not be more than 70 million and he can play lb if shaw gets injured
If u can try sign Tottenham’s Son He is playing striker for his current team and would fit in well! I love the new series already
PCQ - Bring Marcos Llorente for the Midfield position. Also hire a coach for the youth academy
One hour gang
E
Just play amrabat instead of mount and buy a new RB and CB
Sign victor osihmen he is quick and has alot of potential
I think Nacho Fernandez would be a great midfileder for man utd
Siuuu
Try to sign  Federico Valverde he is the fastest midfilder in the eorld qoite young and can play like everywhere😂
Please say Hojlunds name in the right way. Not Holand, Hojlund
Please sign Percy Tau ❤
Sign palacios he has the Pece
Barella is that guy you need
21:17 many red cards
Sign Kevin de bruyne 😂😂😂 (it would be a sick Manchester derby)
Kalulu and camavinga maybe even buy malcom for backup winger Or Pape matar sarr or ST KOLO MUANI OR OSIMHEN.SICK CARERR MODE S2G
Replace Onana 😂
pedri and lewa im not barca fan i am liverpool fan
Mac Allister fo rthe Mason Mount spot would be a good choice either hime or  ruben neves
As someone who never played fifa 22/23 ea fc will be a big upgrade for me
Nice video and when is sidinho coming back
New era,New tradition
30 min gang
You should sign gravenhcberg
Sid i think you should sing lookman bc replacement for rashford if hes injurdured
LAUTARO   MARTINEZ
Mbappe
Remember when every fifa used to start with a Barcelona career mode good times 😢😢 but I still love your vids Sid ❤
Rasmus Holland 💀
You stipules sign Harland after you have money
I liked my own comment 4:16
He said he doesnt wanna manage garnacho again, but he is managing the team garnacho is in lol
20 min gang
Sid I think you should Kalulu fo a backup cb an he is 22 and he could be your future cb and you should sign Bruno guimares or eduardo camavinga or aurline tchuameni
Please sign Sergio Ramos and Virgil van dijk
Day 63 of asking to trying to be famous 😢
Let's go, Sid!!! PCQ: I think you should sign Evan Ferguson from Brighton fot the striker.
PCQ- You should sell martial and mc tominay and should sing old players so young players can have a chance to grow them
You should sign Timo Werner he’s not to old but he’s experienced and a quality striker. You should also sign Federico Gatti he’s an ok center back for squad depth
Please sign Vini Jr to Man Utd. He is the goat and so great. Great content.
Bus griezman because he is 88 rated and a couple years ago there where roomers!
Yoo sidd
Sign Joao Felix PLSS he would be good
sign lorenzo lucca for striker
For striker, I would sign osimhen or openda
21:15 Is that another career mode bug ??? 4 red cards in each team bruh
Ronaldo or Hallend
Please  sign   wirtz
please take some youngster in your squad like tchoumeni
Afternoon sid can you sign Edmond Tabsoba and Hincapie for your CB's and sign Frimpong aswell🤘
Yee
Why tf are they still celebrating after scoring 1-2. They should get the ball and hurry up
Hey sid, big fan. Could you also think about signing the likes of todibo and kolo muani/ramos?? idk about greenwood but I doubt you would consider. And please try reviving sancho's career in-game unlike in real lif and utilise pellistri as sancho's backup on the rw.
hi nice edit s2G
I think you should play hojlund and focus on the CM area. I'd love to see Frenkie de Jong at Man Utd ngl.
You Should Have Done IT By Being More Realstic    BY Not Making Any Signing In Summer Window
Sid is the best FIFA Youtuber i ever seen!❤❤🎉🎉😂😂😊😊
PQ: You need a new cdm and a rcb
TY FOR CHOOSING MAN UTD
definetely a medflider
Sidinho
Just what the whole fifa… ea fc community have been waiting for!!!
PCQ: Mount is not it in this Manchester UTD team. You should either look at another CM that is not too attacking as having Bruno and Mount is not ideal
I think thuram would be a very good talent cm or tchuameni because he was linked with mun utd on this summer
EA dont even add new cutscene for career mode😂
Haaland is fun to sign
this is great but please do a barcelona career mode as well sometime this year, lets not forget the tradition please
Gg sid good vid how about getting cr7 back
For a cb you have to sign Diego Carlos it's a bit of a weird shout but he would fit as a back up doesn't cost much and isn't playing too much
Sign Neymar he is 30 and he can do very well at the st position
frenkie de jong for de midfield
You should sign frankie de jong
Sign Phil Foden
Love this seires give rodrigo number 21. And maybe keep it realistic and buy a netherlands player
We want sidinho with tatooo in player
For the Striker role you should sign Antoine Griezmann. I know he's a bit old but he will last until Hoijlund grows to a hight rating, also for the midfield role, you could sign a player like camavinga or vitinha. Two young players who will have to compete with mount for the starting role.
Damn it feels so weird to not see Sid as the manager now 😂
Day 19 of asking sid to do I fixed Southampton video
PCQ: You must bellingham. He's a versatile player, can score goals, defends quite well and is a box to box midfielder. Love ur vids
ansu fati
Menus look meh to me compared to Fifa 23😑
Sign Fabian Rieder He is An Amazing Wonderkid
Bro volunteerly lost the first game to make the series more interesting
❤❤❤❤❤ Love Sg2
sign young midfielder like pedri, musiala
Chelsea Next❤
PCQ : s2g fc again ❤
I think you should sign bruno guimares from newcastle. He is great at defending and intercepting balls and could provide through balls for your pacy wingers as well.
For center back you should sign silva from benfica love the content 👌🏾
30 min Gang : for midfield you should sign eze or onana and for rb sign di lorenzi or udogie or pape matar sar for spurs GGMU
buy dumfries from inter milan he’s a good overlaying full back and is good for your winger vision
Pcq: sign frankie DE JONG, the dream of Manchester fans and plus he'll entirely control your midfield, it'll be very realistic cuz he had rumors last season tooo. Btw love your vids sid 💜😊
Kolo  muani
1hour gang❤
You should sign valverde or tchoumeni cuz of how many mids madrid have
20 min gang
You should sign Frenkie deJong, he was really close to joining United and he fits the team as well!
Use armbat
boooooooo
For right back i would say nelson semedo or a big name like pavard but in my opinion I prefer semedo for rb role cause it's united
I think kolo Muani would be a good striker
One hour gangggggg
I really want to buy ea fc 24 but I have a ps4 so it will not be good as in ps5 so it’s not worth it 😭😭😭
Keep holjlund
Hey sid I think you should look at bringing in a new midfielder possibly Gavi or Pedri because I feel like Hojland is a good player and he has a lot of potential
You shouldn't sign a striker and I'm sure you realised it already. We've signed Højlund to make him a superstar we don't need to buy a striker. This is a mistake we've made for years signing old "finished article" strikers. Rasmus is our present and future
Sheesh
You should sign Gavi Sid as his potential is big and I think he’d fit in the squad
Your a career mode God Sid💯🫂
Mount was just brought in, give him a chance
Sign wirtz or goretzka, goretza cuz he is a box to box player , wirtz because he has so much potential and he is a finisher which you need in the midfield for left back sign nuno mendes or also for midfield you can get ødegard
He should try and put some academy youngsters on loan as well and he should boost Rasmussen hoijland ovr
Sign david de gea free agent
Plz sign Takefusa Kubo❤
For a midfielder instead of going for the obvious de jong I would say go for someone like Xavier Simons or de Paul 2 different player but can help united and you'd be giving them an upgrade on their clubs
YESSIR, THE START OF A NEW CHAPTER!
pcq: you should buy tchouameni for the midfield
Onana needs to go 😂
For midfield sign Frenkie De Jong. Didn't happen in real life, try and make it happen in game!
My dream is that S2G responds plssss😢
Sign Felix
New era goodbye fifa😢 we'll miss you😊
How about Kolo Muani for the striker
Bro sign victor osimhen from napoli💯 nothing to say about him🥵
15 min gang
Hojbjerg, Goretzka and Kvara are among the names linked to MU. Check them out.
FC 24🎉🎉🎉
You should sign arda guler. Hes got FANTASTIC potencial and since in real life mount costed man u so much you can still use him until arda becomes better.
Yo wassup Sid Messi is the goat Ronaldo is always the second
You dshould sign tonali love the contet
S2G gang love❤
Sign  Luis Alberto or Enzo
LETS GOO
Do chelsea
Tottenham Sarr is good
Keep up the work man❤❤
For a striker I would say either lacazette or lukaku cause its a bit of a different signing and makes it more fun
My man is saving my club
Buy valverde, he is all rounded and will fit in your team
Thank you sid... We waited so long😢😢😅😅
Sign Antonio Silva as the CB depth, or Todibo that was linked last window
PCQ: Hey Sid, I I think buying a veteran striker is the way to go,  this will help hojlund grow and once he is ready in few seasons time, he can replace the veteran
You should sign frankie de jong. He is the perfect pacey midfielder with creative abilities.
please i wan t i want the fc24
Sidinho to Manchester United Here We Go
Finally, it's not Barcelona😭
mokoko is a perfect striker when I used him he became a beast
yess... can't wait for sidinho

Let's go another S2G banger

Sign Dumfries for RB

Keep hojlund as a starter as Manchester United payed like 80 million for him so it will be foolish to not start him...
You should sign goretzka for The midfield position because he îs box to box has a lot of stamina and îs physical too
Bro I say why don't you sign jobe Bellingham
respect to FIFA for being good to us but it ended
Sign orkun kocku from benfica
Hey.. Can You Do An MBS Pro League Series as Well  Al Hilal Maybe.. If You Do. Can U Show My Name Pls😅
Lets go Sid next time Liverpool not that scum Man U 😂
Bro  Please learn the pronounciation of hojlund
make Rodrygo number 7 please, also the world class midfielder should be Pedri (I would choose Bellingham but he just joined Real Madrid, so don't sign him) .
