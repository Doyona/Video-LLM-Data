Moon was super underrated. Worth watching
They missed “Jojo Rabbit”?!?!
His line in the 1st and best teenage mutant ninja turtles movie "you want regular or menthol" should of won the Emmy
The green mile ,,,fantastic
The role that stood out most to me is in "The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy". I appreciated that movie's creativity. It was fun to watch and can be watched over and over.
more commercials please
Regular or menthol
Three Billboards is one of my fav movies.  Amazing cast and story.
Love him...so fun to watch whatever he's in!
Who doesn't love the Mara sisters?
No...The Best of Enemies?  So many great roles!
Gary Meadows is his most Iconic role
Dirty socialist commi
Loved him in Heist with Gene Hackman, one of my favorite movies. Sam Rockwell never disappoints.
What about Choke?!
Another of my favorite actors,  His Guy Fleegman was perfect.
Matthew McConaughey isn't in point break
No TMNT? 🙂😉
We were very faithful to the book. Something that's a myth in today's Hollywood.
He is ultimatly a theatre actor, the way he picks his parts and works to that effect really shows the artform of an actor, without seeming to be pretentious. He's in for the love of the game, and it shows.
Bro just quietly crushes every role he takes
Should’ve talked about his involvement in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990)
WOW...no JoJo.. His last scene in that movie was a masterclass.. such depth!
Ninja turtles tho?
Disappointed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles wasn’t mentioned…
Captain K!!!! WHOOOOOOOOP! 🎉🥳
My favorite Sam Rockwell movies are not even listed here.  The best of Enemies, where he plays a klan leader who gets paired up with a strong female civil rights activists, who slowly changes his outlook on life.  The other is the Winning season, where he plays a girl's basketball coach, who again starts off as a drunk and is verbally abusive, and is slowly transformed by the team and getting to reconnect with his daughter who hates him.
Sam Rockwell and Christian Bale are my favorite actors. If you haven't seen "Jojo Rabbit" go watch it! Wonderful movie and Mr. Rockwell is fabulous in it too.
Moon is really one of the best sci-fi films out there and he is perfect.
Wait, Matthew McConaughey wasn't in Point Break lol
Gentleman Broncho is some of his best! Love that movie
This is a masterpiece.
Ok so joaquim phoenix gary oldman and sam rockwell .... someone write the script
High-quality reporting.
The production is top-notch.
I appreciate the detailed analysis.
The harmony is wonderful.
I appreciate the detailed analysis.
Well-researched and accurate.
Very reliable source of information.
The production is top-notch.
Very insightful reporting.
Music at its finest.
Absolutely love this tune.
That was my back up nads
Love the guy!
🛌
Can I just say one of the biggest keys to Galaxy's quest success was Alan Rickman, he's one of the best parts of that movie
I wish they wouldve included The Way Way Back. Very obscure film of his but one of my favs
Well-researched and accurate.
Why is there always a dinner table?
still think about moon to this day
I loved the one with John Turritino!
GENTLEMAN BRONCOS.
His character in the green mile was so perfectly loathsome. I despised that guy. Testament to Rockwells acting skills
He should have gotten an Oscar nomination for Moon.
" MATCHSTICK MEN "
My fav american actor since Moon! Hope to watch him again so he can pick his Oscar.
Would have loved to hear him talk about his role in Safe Men.  Loved that one...
Didnt ask about The Assassination of Jesse James... the best Western ever made
I thought he was great in Welcome to Colinwood
I like how he shouts out the cast and crew members he worked with
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1990
One of the most underrated actors
How about Captain K in Jojo Rabbit... he was excellent.
great actor 😊
Can't miss him as Bronco/Brutus in Gentleman Broncos!
I get that people like Marvel movies. But seeing a Marvel movie as iconic for this career is a bit sad.
Sam Rockwell is that dude 💯 he is HIM
a great actor wasted in plenty of shite films
bummed you didnt ask him about him in the OG TMNT in 1990
They put Argylle in but not Jojo Rabbit??? 😭
Im here looking for his appearance in TMNT !
I think he's great in A Midsummer Night's Dream, especially his last scene.
So glad MOON made it into this.
Choke????
Sam made JoJo rabbit for me and also Hitchhikers guide.
Don't ever forget his role in Stella Shorts as the pizza delivery guy. Also Zach Galifianakis, Bradley Cooper, Elizabeth Banks, Paul Rudd, Julie Bowen. Showalter, Wain, and Black got these pretty faces before they were stars.
Captain K was his best Jojo rabbit
One of my all time favourite actors. He is marvellous.
Sam is iconic
One of my favourite actors of all times. Absolutely love his movies. What a great dude, actor and highly underrated.
What about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , 1990
Incredible actor, JoJo Rabbit was his best role.
He needs an Oscar
13:37 Ok so for Zaphod, this was my introduction to Sam Rockwell as an actor. Yes, I had likely seen him before, but had no idea who he was. It was the book that I knew backwards and forwards. I just found it so interesting that he took on sort of a Chad Kroeger "rock star" take on the character, given the band Nickelback was flying high by that point.  He and Ed Norton could easily be brothers in a movie.
great actor. so many great parts
what about the choke movie
He should add Mr Wolf to his curriculum.
one of the best actors of all time! do not underestimate his talent!!
How they didn't talked about Jo Jo rabbit
if you dont like sam rockwell, ill fight you
I love how it's never really talked about, him being in the original 90's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie. Lol.
I wish they would have put The Bad Guys on here. I would have loved to have seen him break that role down.
justin hammer was great
I could listen to Sam all day!
They always use 80% lame movies when the actor has done a lot of great movies in these vids
He said Matthew McConaughey in Point Break. 🤔
I loved Guy Fleegman in Galaxy Quest!
Loved his character in galaxy quest!
Rockwell in 'Billboards' is one of the best performances I ever saw. Weird, appalling and very human.
Sam is so great. Too many roles to list. Matchstick Men is one of my faves.
Not only a legend himself, but all the stars he has worked with...holy what a list of Legends
MAGRATHEA!!! MAGRATHEA!!!
Great talent.  Loved how he played his character in JoJo Rabbit....
Learn what Iconic means you dweebs
nobody dances like sam rockwell.
2 words..Galaxy    Quest
Seven Psychopaths is excellent. Hardly anyone talks about it.
greatest actor....
I became a huge fan of Sam because of the way way back.
Dude might be my favorite actor..Matchstick Men is outstanding
Tom Cruise was the perfect Les Grossman, but I think Sam could've also pulled that character off!
His craziest characters he played was in Gentlemen Broncos. Absolutely hilarious and stupid funny movie.
He would be a great Carnage 🤷
Box of Moonlight ❤
You love the parts actors play so much and then you meet the actor and you go meh, don’t really care to know that guy…
ROCKWELL WOULD'VE BEEN A BETTER TONY STARK. MORE LIKEABLE, QUICK WITTED-ER, AND DOES BETTER IMPRESSIONS, FUNNIER,...
Moon is such a fantastic movie, made all the better by Sam Rockwell's incredible performance.
I don’t know what it is exactly that makes Sam Rockwell the scariest actor ever for me.
I'm sure Sam Rockwell have had bad individual performances in movies.. like, I'm sure they exist. But I haven't been able to find them yet.
wild bill
"Most iconic" - because every character he plays has been iconic, no exceptions. Hard to think of someone who entertains as well, and as consistently, as Sam.
There is a lot more to this guy than I thought... I am a fan, but I didn't realize how smart, articulate, dedicated, and humble he was.... Thanks!
Who?
Exceptional n outstanding actor 4 sure. ❤
I ❤️ Sam
nobody but Sam could have played Zaphod
The Way Way Back.....
One and only, everything he does is great.
Gentlemen Broncos!!
Like this guy in everything he's played in. Especially in the green mile.
I love Sam Rockwell! His characters are always great and can carry a movie!
Noticed him first as great actor in Hitchikers Guide, then Moon (fantastic) then all the rest enjoyed pretty much every flick with him.
Wait, what, no Jojo Rabbit???
A straight up hall of famer.
Thank you for moon
One of my  - if not THE - favourite movies by this awesome actor is Lawn Dogs. Not many people know of it but it's where I first got caught eye of him. What an amazing actor, bringing so many diverse characters to life. Cheers
Sam Rockwell has long been one of my favorite actors. Now I have to go see the movies discussed here that I haven't seen yet. Thanks!
Stephen King is an idiot.
The film with Jon turttoro. Was the best
I've hated Sam since The Green Mile. Lol. Goes to show what an excellent actor I think he is.
What, no Bronco?
Cyclops there! , Cyclops there! ..... Dune buggy !!
Dom Verdeen, Bronc/Brutus, Zaphod Beeblebrox😁
7 psychopaths is underestimated film!
If Sam is a support character he is highlight if the movie! I remember all the moveis i watched where he has been!
No "way way back???!!!"
What about “The Way Way Back?”  A very cute story with Sam as a lovable character.
One of the only actors I have an ongoing crush on…love him.
We are so lucky to watch Sam create his art.
No TMNT?
This guy is a fave of mine and truly an actors actor.
Iconic works.
His role in green mile was great
One of my favorite actors, one of the best actors of the generation, and many of my favorite roles in several of my favorite movies. Sam Rockwell is a gem, a national treasure.
And Lawn Dogs?! Why doesn't he talk about his best role?!
Sam Rockwell and Sean William Scott are massively underrated and underutilised.
band of brothers?
Guy
idk why he sounds just like owen wilson if he didnt break his nose
Wow all these interviews are great!
Living Life Through Chemistry is probably one of my favorite movies !
Why do they always say Partner and not Wife?
What a legend was watching and seen him in like this guy is a legend
7 psychopaths! So underated.
Love this guy he is deeper than the Mariana Trench .
great video i promise, friggen ads are stupid
He was absolutely brilliant in Three Billboards. ❤
We NEED Galaxy Quest 2
Loved Moon.
"Moon" is a must watch movie and Sam is fantastic in it.
Moon is in my top 5 films of all time ❤
Galaxy Quest was the abolute best because Sam sold the red shirt crewman thing so well and Zaphod Beeblebrox was the perfect politician
I am appalled that this list didn’t include Bronco/Brutus in Gentlemen Broncos. Truly fantastic role.
THE WAY, WAY BACK ! I loved that film and Sam’s role in it.  It’s on my annual watch list.  A small, intimate yet heartfelt an uplifting film, I can’t believe it wasn’t on this list.
This guy here is one of the masters. I freaking love his performance in anything he did on the screen.
Would be nice without advertisements every 45 seconds.
I've watched moon like 100 times it feels like :)
Loved his character in JO JO RABBIT. He was excellent in that role. Great Actor. Huge talent
I think someone said it best... He could have made a great Joker.
I love this guy but why oh why he looks like a  homeless ?  I could PayPal him  2. 3 grand!
No Safe Men, tragedy
Dude!  I was waiting for Jojo Rabbit.
1:23 Tell me that wasn’t directly inspired by Zorg in the 5th Element.
You do not know what "iconic" means do you?...
Would of loved to hear his thoughts about matchsticks men along side Nicholas Cage... 😢
I don’t listen to people who don’t respect Uncle Stevie.  Sorry.
My favorite is Glory Daze
Great now I gotta do a Sam Rockwell marathon
It's all just Great! For Sam Rockell.
No mention of Matchstick Men?...why? Never heard of most of the other movies...whatever.
2:13 wildly, there’s also a Dixon, Missouri. And my mom lived there. 😂  You’ins means you all or y’all and sody water means soda pop, soda, coke or pop. 😂😂😂
*Crushing* and *swooning* over here. Unapologetically! 😂
He should have won an Oscar for gentleman Bronco
“You look like a radioactive tampon. A banana with a yeast infection”. 😅😅😅 Freaking love Sam Rock!🥰🥰
I should watch Vice again...
One of my personal favorites?...Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri. The racist cop. You know got chops when you can make the audience absolutely despise the character that you're portraying yet still know its not really you and love your acting.
Sam Rockwell was the PERFECT casting as Zaphod.    My being a HHGTTG fan for 40 years I was so worried about the casting of that film - casting was everything.   Ford & Trillian was mis-cast but the rest were perfection. 🇬🇧
You can tell he loves Film , which is why he is so convincing in every role , Just watched 3 Billboards last night , but Confessions of a dangerous mind is a personnel favorite. He literally became Chuck Barris in that movie -WOW !
I might be the only one but I love Winning Season
Method actor to the fullest ❤
Any and every character he plays is the absolute best!❤
Bro gave himself a genuine panic attack to nail a scene. Talking about method acting
Sam was in the undisputed greatest film of all time....1990's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles It's a masterpiece and has aged incredibly well over the past 35 years
Dude steals every scene he’s in. Legend
One of those actors who is better known for his characters than himself. That's a compliment, take note Cruise, Pitt, Clooney etc.
He’s great in every movie I’ve seen him in… I am a little disappointed that they didn’t ask him about the movie Choke. That was my introduction to him and it was a really great film. I was interested to see what his take was on it.
How Gentlemen Broncos didn't make the list is a travesty.
his most iconic character is vic richards
I really didn't like the light-hearted comedy aspect that the director brought his Green Mile character early on, given what is revealed about the crime central to the story later. I thought it was completely inappropriate.
No love for Kaptain K? 😢
Wait.... No Jojo Rabbit? Joke inside? He's absolutly legendary in the role of captain K!
I love, love, every movie Sam Rockwell is in❤❤❤❤. He is fantastic!
Real, real, real crying shame... that Gentlemen Broncos isn't on here...  GQ... I mean come on it's in the name!
I like how consistent his characters are - it’s cool to trust an actor to pull off any role he’s in. And he does make everything he’s in better.  Even Guy was great… and in my heart of hearts I find  Zaphod attractive.  I watch that movie falling asleep and I just love all the small details. Both Galaxy Quest and Hitchhikers
He was superb in Seven Psychopaths!
I’ll watch anything movie he’s in ❤
That was a great job I hated you in the green mile
Moon is a gem.
I always forget he's in certain movies, because It was just Wild Bill, or Zaphod in the movie, not Sam Rockwell. 🤣 I'm like "OH HEY! It's Sam!" and then immediately forget it's him and not the character. One of the highest praises I can give to an actor!
I phucking love Sam Rockwell
The ads on this video are atrocious.
7 psychopaths my favorite wow
What?!?!?!  No Gentleman Broncos?????? Best role ever!!!
Moon was is best film and one of my favourite movies
This dude can Act
Not sure why JoJo Rabbit was not on the list.....awesome movie.
Your favorite actor's favorite actor. Unbelievably versatile
Always knew who Sam Rockwell  was in movies, Galaxy  Quest is where i learned to love him.
Galaxy Quest and honorable mention to the Green Mile.
His role in charlies angels always stuck with me lol "you shake and ill bake"
It was better as a Star Trek episode.
This dude just likes to dance. I mean HE LIKES TO DANCE in his movies
No Gentleman Broncos? Hahaha
Wheres Clownhouse??
His most iconic character was a sissy asian girl.
Tremendous actor
Moon is one of my favorite movies.
No Matchstick Men?  That's the movie that made me really appreciate him as an actor.
Besides the Green Mile, I’ve never watched these movies — but after this recap I *want to*
Genius
Moon was best
He started out in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles such a great actor back then to.
"Harmless like Bill Gates" is wild
I appreciate how he remembers everyone’s name that he worked with.
total legend
I've been a fan of Sam Rockwell for about 20 years and I've always thought he's such an underrated actor. I also think he's quite fit, which just adds to the viewing experience 😄
I’ve always liked Sam Rockwell and always felt bad that I couldn’t remember his name.
Sam Rockwell is the president of the galaxy?  Wow.
Armor wars North K - 10 years Hammers industries - 20
Me encanta este actor.
Great actor & great dancer
LOVED "The way way back"
One of those actors that makes everything he's in better just by his presence.
He should have won a academy award for the green mile movie.
His voice is so much deeper in real life
Confessions of a dangerous mind.❤
Box Of Moonlight
Oh my gosh amazing actor
We love him
How do you mention all of these roles and skip Lawn Dogs?!!! One of his best. An absolute classic.
Lawn Dogs in kentucky… that is an oldie indy
GQ SAM ROCKWELL 🦸🛫🛸
MOON was awesome, my favorite film he was in.
he's incredible in fosse/verdon--not an easy role at all, esp. playing off Michelle Williams!
Missed Choke.
11:20 I was obsessed with his “bad guy” scenes in Charlie’s angels, i thought he was so cute 😆
Where was Jojo Rabbit?! Dude is iconic
What about Choke? 😲
What a talent he is
Now I need a Sam Rockwell movie marathon!
I just realized my coworker Gabe looks like scruffy Sam Rockwell.
Shame no Gentleman Broncos
no Don Verdean???
"you have a real beard under a fake beard" :)))
Let's not forget Gentlemen Broncos! He's great in everything.
Sam is simply a tremendous actor yet humble which makes him more likable.
I loved him in Charlie's Angel's. It totally surprised me!
I don't know why anyone would want to be an actor. Yuck. Too much.
YEA! I love you Sam
I loved “Matchstick Men.” Dude crushed it
When I see Sam Rockwell I only see a Thai girl
Now that Walton Goggins is getting more recognition, Sam Rockwell is my pick for MOST underrated actor.  Absolutely phenomenal in everything he does.
Sam's an actor's actor, like Chris Walken. Just digs in as far as he can (or needs to.) The Fosse performance was seriously next level. That sh!t is so much harder than he makes it look. His expanded cameo in White Lotus S3 was just about perfect.
Moon was amazing
I hated him in the Green Mile. My daughter says 'jobs done'.  Ever seen him dance?
Moon is such an underrated gem. It's almost criminal in how under the radar that film is.
No Matchstick Men?
Please redo it and add the White Lotus monologue! That'd be amazing!
Tmnt?
gentleman broncos needs to be on this list, Bronco IS Sams most iconic role
Just watched his UNHINGED monologue in season 3 of The White Lotus. You have to give it to Sam...  He will go there.
Easily one of my favorite actors of all time. Gentlemen Broncos, he is iconic in
missed an oppurtunity too talk too him about safe men
Him, Gary Oldman and Christian Bale have the same passion to what they do! Love them ❤️🍿
Need him back to talk about White Lotus
No Ninja Turtles??? I’m offended.
I love Sam!!
And most recently he’s played a dude who’s an Asian girl being railed by dudes while an actual Asian girl watches
I became a huge fan of his after 'The Way Way Back'.  When he is on screen you canmnot take your eyes off or him and listen to every word.  He is such a talent.
Matchstick Men with Sam Rockwell and Nick Cage is an absolute belter of a film as well.
Sam Rockwell is an  american treasures!
I love the movie Conviction
What a fimography. I loved him in Jojo Rabbit too. What stage presence!
If Bale were American😊
Is that a shirt with white lotuses on it ? 😮
Argyle????????????????????
I’m big fan was hoping for breakdown of Choke
How come i dont know moon?
My late friend Joe was Sam's double for Hitchhikers Guide.
Should have asked him about his first movie "Clownhouse"
No Jesse James?! That one was BEST!
I was watching thinking to myself.. OMG is he not going to talk about 'Moon'???? but then he saved best for last.
Seven Psychopaths is one great flick.
My favorite role of his is the Green Mile
He briefly mentioned Welcome  to Collinwood, as where he met George Clooney. That film is great, also starring Clooney and the fabulous Patricia Clarkson.
He's one of the Greats😎😎😎
Best actor
His double role in 'Gentlemen Broncos" is my fav.
The new trend in Holiday - try and look as Ugly as possible
He always reminds me of a young Gary Oldman. Fantastic actor. Love Moon.
✨🔥🎉GENTLEMEN BRONCO 🎉 🔥✨
I like Sam Rockwell
Dudes a Legendary actor
Sad that Gentlemen Broncos wasn't talked about.
jojo rabbit ?? :)
Love Sam Rockwell movies…
He is a true character actor. What s talent.
Sam is awesome!
loved him in ninja turtles
He’s lovely   This shirt however
So open, remembers references and nuances, dances amazindgy and fs himself - LEGEND!
Wait ... Matthew McConaughey in Point Break?
HOW could matchstick men not make the list?!?
Sam Rockwell is a badass!
Love this actor..he's so frekn funny.  Miss him alot but love when he's in movies.
Moon is incredible and Sam Rockwell is too.
Don’t forget his greatest role of all:   “Got any cigarettes?”  “Regular… or menthol?”
How could they not include Jojo Rabbit???
Why doesnt he mention Always sunny ever. Is he embarrassed being in it
I can't believe the movie "Heist" is not listed.
Sam Rockwell is one of those actors that is seamless and what he does. It's like i can look at him and know who he is and yet forget who he is.
I hope they're bringing back Justin Hammer. He would slide nicely in the modern MCU. With Julia Louis-Dreyfus and all of them folks.
" They took my nads."  I love this guy.
I must say, Sam Rockwell is one of my favorite actors. I don't particularly have faves, but I enjoy many of his movies, so that says a lot. 👍✨️
They way way back is my favorite of his characters
That lil town outside of Asheville he is talking about is Black Mountain NC. That’s where the billboards are located and the town pump bar scenes. All the town shoots was in Sylva NC.
Hitchhiker's Guide.... the best book/movie .. ever!! Thanks to his character he made the movie!!😂❤❤❤
Sam Rockwell is such a legend.
Please bring back Galaxy Quest! 🎉
He is cooked in this interview!  why do celebs have to do so many drugs?
The assassination by Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford………..
Been a huge fan of Sam's ever since Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind. He's great in everything, and his performance in Moon should have won him an Oscar.
Siempre he pensado que el es el sucesor de Gary Oldman ambos son irreverentes, me encantan
I like rockwell less after watching this
I just adore Sam Rockwell. An instant must watch if I see he's in a film.
I wished he had talked about his character in JoJo Rabbit. I thought that was great - so poignant in the end.
Please do a Galaxy Quest sequel 🥲
Sam Rockwell is always a delight. Unique and Positive Energy.   Team up with Jamie Fox and you have an synergistic duo that can go new heights.
I finally saw The Winning Season recently; it was an incredibly solid sports movie!
well I guess we can add White Lotus to this now
Of all the award quality rolls he's played.....his character in "The Sitter" is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
My favorite movie by Sam is "Moon". What a great film. He did an amazing job in it too.
We here after his White Lotus monologue??!?!
Box of Moonlight 🌙
Loved Sam in Fosse/Verdon
My wife won't watch any film with Sam in it because she hated him in the Green Mile so much.
What? No The way way back!?  Wtf
Wow, this guy has been living in my head rent free my whole life, and I just learned his name today ❤Sam Rockwell❤  I listen to the audiobook to sleep every night, so I see Sam as Zaphod running around my head every night😂
He was so great in MOON.
He wants to be an Asian girl
Which performance did Rockwell win the Oscar for? Was it Moon?
Galaxy Quest!! 😄
Underrated actor,he was awesome in Confessios  of a dangerous mind
Zeyphoid Beetlebrox my favorite
He’s so great, I love him
He manages to change not only his physical appearance and voice but his whole mental personality. Sam may a better chameleon actor than Gary Oldman.
WOW!! Him in the Green Mile. What a roll he Played!! I so disliked Him!!! He has been so Funny in His others
He had iconic roles?
He was frikkin terrifying in the Green Mile!
I love him in F is for family
Gentlemen Broncos should have been on here.
Usually  when  I  see him on the screen  I  pay close  and I  mean  close  attention  to  what  it  is  that  he  says in the films he  does  Usually  I can not heat his  words well he might have  a  speech  impediment
He always reminds me of like the extremely cool Dana Carrey.
Rockwell in Jojo Rabbit was legendary
He still looks the same wtf
Moon   Superb
moon needed more talk, super under appreciated film
I fell in love with confessions of a dangerous mind. The end was mindblowing.
“Regular, or menthol.”
Well, you made an impression on me in Galaxy Quest that's one of my emails😮 Roc Ingersoll😅😂
I loved him as that Guy in Galaxy Quest in the red shirt.
Where the EVERLOVING F*** is Captain Klezendorf?!
No Match Stick Men?????!!!!! Come on.
No talk about "gentlemen broncos"?
Most underrated actor. He needs to do Tarantino.
hes a Genius
It’s who you know
I can’t name an actor who I like more then Sam Rockwell. Being coolest dancer, horrible villain, silly galaxy emperor, serious astronaut etc. He nails every single role. He is not a superstar but he is super actor.
First time I ever saw Sam Rockwell on screen he said: “Regular? Or menthol?”
My favorite scene was that dance he performed in Charlie's Angels!
My favorite Sam Rockwell movie is Moon. Its a must watch!
Hey, what about Lawn Dogs?
Matchstick Men is underrated.
Great actor. Love the watch. I would do an emerald colored submariner date.
Another great, The way,way  back❤
Why am I just realizing that all these characters are the same guy?
The sitter was gold
Three Billboards was a special movie. The "Fargo" category and not only because McDormand was in it. It actually was the perfect mix of comedy and drama. Dixon listening to Sheriff Willoughby's message while the fire raged in his back had me in stitches!
😍😍😍
All I wanted was a piece of corn bread you mother...ers. ! I loved that. Hilarious.
How dare them not mention Gentlemen Broncos
He turned into Mick Foley
How can he not mention……CHOKE!   Fabulous movie!!!
2:02 his best role imo
Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is just an incredible movie.
I feel bad i did not know who Sam Rockwell was until Jojo rabbit
Sam is a gem ❤
Not having Gentleman Broncos on this list feels like a major oversight.
I think you’re a fantastic actor and watching you dance is sublime! Love you Sam.
I adore Rockwell,  the only thing is I think his lack of ability to change his voice makes his instantly recognisable in films.  Someone like Oldman or even Bale can completely disappear in characters.
He was awesome in JoJo Rabbit
I wish Sam Rockwell and Gary Oldman were in the same movie playing brothers - they would be gods!
Galaxy Quest - I first saw it on TV years after and I was like: "WHY didn't I ever heard about this movie? It is great!" -  A bit like "The Green mile " - that is much more know but still not to the point of cult - and is a GREAT movie in so many aspects. This are two movies I would watch again and again and always be learning something new. They are more than that story. They speak about us as humans - even if one is a comedy in space. It criticizes and exposes our society, our change of values, celebrity ilusion, justice, cruelty, frienship, respect, etc, etc
I haven’t seen Moon, did he dance in it? If so, I’m in😅😅😅😅
Wow his partner was the journalist in IM1!!
I love mr.Write where is this movie?
He’s pure jazz, the way he talks about his acting and inspiration.
It is an absolute travesty that they didn't include Gentlemen Broncos in this.
Love all of this.  That he said even its it is a comedy, for him, it is still a drama... is perfect... you have to do the silly stuff but only after you really establish yourself as that person living that life.  Sam is not the same as, but reminds me of Gary Oldman's ability to be anywhere in any movie.
Galaxy Quest 2!?! I would watch it in the theater 100 times. Please make this happen.
I can't remember Sam Rockwell being in any movie I disliked.
Wot no Gentlemen Broncos?
Him talking about loyalty to the Shredder in Teemage Mutant Ninja Turtles was amazing
I get the vibe that Sam  feels undervalued in Hollywood and I would agree. He's an underrated talent.
wow haha that's the first time I've ever heard someone refer to Stephen King as "Stevie" 😄
HOW DO YOU SPELL UNDERRATED THIS GUY SHOULD HAVE  A WALL FULL OFF OSKERS
Sam is one of the best actors around
Sam was in The Green Mile with Tom Hanks, and later in Galaxy Quest with Tim Allen. There's a snake in my infinity and beyond..
Sam Rockwell is a master of his craft! Every role he takes on is pure gold—charismatic, intense, and always unforgettable. 🔥👏 Who else thinks he’s one of the most underrated actors out there? 🎭🎬
Trabajo en la película Milagros inesperados con Tom Hanks, hermosa película!!! Su personaje era de un ser malvado, su interpretación muy buena!!!
Hmmm he would have been a great Tony stark. Love him in every movie he has been in.
Shoutout to his performance in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford
I fell in love with him in A Midsummer Nights Dream 🥰
Since I haven’t seen anyone say it, this guy was awesome and a total badass in Richard Jewell
Amazing actor, professional chameleon, and shapeshifter.
They could not have picked a better person to play wild bill.
sam youre the best
How is Gentlemen Broncos not in the list???
One of my favorite actors. I know its kind of a goofy movie but his role in Galaxy Quest cracks me up. "DO I? DO I?!!" 😂
Love Sam Rockwell and many of the movies mentioned but there is a reason nobody saw Winning Season😄 Not everything is gold.
Why not gentleman’s bronco?!
Billy Bickle / Jack of Diamonds, Seven Psychopaths
I heard Sam always find a way to bust some dance moves in his movies.😂
GENTLEMEN BRONCO
1990s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Enough said.
The way way back OMG HE MADE THAT MOVIE
Underrated actor
sam rockwell = self proclaimed imitator. Of all the "Most Iconic" vids you're the only actor I come away with a lower opinion of.  The Green Mile and that's it.
So great
The green mile is the best movie ever
love Sammy !!
His performance in the Green Mile, to me, was the most compelling performance. It was frightening, and he was so convincing. I was a jail guard at one time in the mid 90's and watched over an intensive supervision unit, where death row, high profile and the most disruptive inmates were held. We had an inmate, who was so cunning, disruptive, and absolutely out there, but not certifiable. I saw Sam Rockwell play as Wild Bill Wharton and was completely stunned. His performance was so spot on, that I almost believed he had to have studied this former inmate. Haunting is the best way I can describe it.  Love Sam's works.
What happened to Frost / Nixon. It’s only my favorite movie that I’ve seen him in.
No bronco ?
13:13 my fav character 😂😂😂
He’s such a brilliant actor
Gentlemen Broncos was my favorite role of his in an amazing filmography
See How They Run was great too.
The Winning Season was great.
No mention of Gentleman Broncos . BLASPHEMY
I was introduced they cheeks angels and no we didn't see it coming. Love it!!
The way way back
What moon were he is clone that keeps getting inccenrated he thinks the inccenerator is a space ship I won't tell every thing
He is such a great actor 👏🏻👏🏻 loving his characters since The green mile and on, I wanted to see him talking about Charlie’s angels too!
Sam Rockwell, Edward Norton, Gary Oldman... Such chameleons.
I actually love Ironman 2, specially for Sam, such a great character
No Gentleman Broncos?
You are a most amazing actor. I can literally hate your character
Was he on "Pete and Pete" back in the 90's
WHere the F is Gentlemen Bronco?
Moon was amazing
Sam Rockwell is brilliant. Where was 'Bronco?'
The most iconic actor tends to be the most humble.
His performance in green mile was so epic wow
He credits his ideas to many different actors yet there's no one like Sam Rockwell.  He is one of a kind. I love him!
I love Sam Rockwell, super underrated actor. He often fools me with his roles, how he can act and look so differently in them that I get that feeling "I know i've seen this guy before..." and I look up the character, and end up surprised that it was Sam and that I didn't recognize him.
Where’s my jojo rabbit
He’s my favorite
Love all his movies. Not a bad one in the bunch
What? No Bronco?! Cyclops there, cyclops there....
Galaxy Quest really turned out to be something great
Matthew wasn't in Point Break lol
Fantastic actor.
Such a fantastic actor, he's is, at least for me, someone that no matter the part, he instantly steals the scene.
I don't get the hate for Ironman 2. It was great.
hear me out you guys
Gentelmen broncooooos... You've missed the best part
"Cyclops there. Cyclops there. Cyclops there."
My fav is definitely President Beeblebrox!
So glad moon was in there, underrated gem.
One of my favorite actors, Bravo Mr Rockwell.
He may not have had the biggest role in this, but I would have loved to hear him talk about his role in “Jojo Rabbit”.
No mention of matchstick men!? 🥺
It's absolutely criminal Justine Hammer has never neen brought back
My favorite actor. Hands down.
Where is GENTLEMEN BRONCOS‽!
Sam rockwell is such a talented actor. He's the star of One of my alltime favorite movies:Moon
Moon  Just saying
Sorry, my favorite is Gentleman Bronco.... "Turrets"
Why did they not get him to sing bbq?
I’ll take a Guy Fleegman over a George Clooney any day.
I like him in ninja turtles
choke is one of his best movies
he does not seem all there. lol He does NOT want to be here
green mile and galaxy quest are the ones i always remember because of his character.
The Way Way Back!!!
I love Sam!!!
I'd watch Sam read the paper all day
My favorite character that Sam has played is Owen in The Way Way Back.
his dance in charlie's angels is the best part of the movie. i'll never forget it.
The Way Way Back....one of his best ever roles. Terrible omission
I love him and need more movies with him. He is amazing!
I want an entire trilogy of Yeast Lords movies with Sam as Bronco... even more flamboyant than before. Even more sparkles.
I wanna hear about Gentleman Bronco
Rockwell was fking AMAZING in 7 Psychopaths.  What a helluva piece that was, too.
One of my absolute favorites.
You know Sam would be great for a role in the fall out series tho it may be to late lol
Wild Bill was hilarious
2:15 It’s Macs mom!
Im not a celebrity worshipper by any stretch, but I genuinely appreciate Sam Rockwell.  Highly underrated.   Same with John C. Reilly.  These two guys are in so many movies.  And not type casts.   Incredibly diverse.
I would like to see something like comedy road movie with Sam rockwell and Walton gogins as brothers tearing up the road
Who's Tim Robbins?
Peter Dinklage, what a trumped up little dwarf, still the perfect height 😁
If only The Bad Guys were listed here...
Sam Rockwell is a formidably talented actor.
Fleegman.  All the other characters are inferior.
Jojo Rabbit, The way way back.  How do you not include those?
7 psychopaths is so underrated
Fosse/Verdon Brilliant!
Sam is great.
His flamboyant character in Gentlemen Broncos is hilarious and I wish he spoke about that one.
Love his take on impersonating famous people, how you want to nail how they sound but not lose the interpretation of how the person is viewed. Probably due to fact it’s more likely to hold the audience’s attention to the character.
Jojo Rabbit ❤
Teenage mutant ninja turtles!
Gentleman Broncos
One of the best, and I don't think he gets how loved he is. Not a bad film that he's done!
I’m not seeing results
I was hoping he would talk about the assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert Ford. That was a stellar cast and he was stellar in it
Bronco?
Most underrated actor ever. Period.
Love❤️ love❤️ Sam Rockwell!!!  He's wonderful!!!
They didn’t include The Bad Guys
I love Sam in Moon. One of my favorite movies ever.
Lawndogs is my favorite
I hope Gentlemen Broncos is in here
I'm disappointed he didn't mention Gentlemen Broncos - Yeast Lord!!!
WHAT ABOUT BRONCO?!?!?
No Gentleman Broncos, what.
What about Choke?!!!?!?!!
Love Sam Rockwell!
He is great in everything he acts in! One of the best actors today! Thanks Sam! Bravo!
Safe Men. Great movie.
Really hoping for JoJo Rabbit lol
Wished they would have mentioned Gentlemen Broncos
such an underrated actor, I loved his performance in jojo rabbit
The way they were like...let's skip Little Children
My favorite Sam Rockwell movie is The Way Way Back with Steve Carell and Toni Collette.  I love that film!
He was great in Idiocracy.
😮
Sam, maybe  l have  seen  you  before  ! ! !
Sam ,I've  never  seen  you  before  , but  you seem  pretty  laid  back.!! !
It's hard for me to think of any other actor who steals a movie is consistently as Sam Rockwell. I would have loved for him to have gotten a part in the Oceans trilogy, maybe as Casey Affleck's brother
Very surprised that "The Way Way Back" didn't make the list.
the way way back is such an amazing movie. it’s sad that it gets almost no recognition to this day.
I like this kind of actors more than most of the superstars.
Galaxy Quest, like The Princess Bride, is one of the rare perfectly cast movies. Nobody was the wrong choice for their character. No character could have been played by anyone else. Sam absolutely steals the show any scene he's in.
When I first saw Green Mile, I couldn’t figure out who the actor was, and I first thought it was Ewan McGregor. Years later I finally found out about Sam. I’ve been a fan ever since.
Not talking about Matchstick Men was a huge miss, 2nd favorite of his films after Seven Psychopaths.
Sam is my comfort actor. 💙
Would make a brilliant loki or thor 😂
I still remember Sam Rockwell played one of the Foot Clan in the first TMNT movie 😂
Confessions of a Dangerous Mind
Moon was awesome. One of my favourite SF movies of all time.
Honorable mention: The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Sad to see it not on the list. One of his best supporting roles, imo
HAPPY 56TH BIRTHDAY SAM ROCKWELL !!!!
Honestly think he would be twice as funny & entertaining in real life.  The way he discusses his prep for each role makes me want to see them, even ones I’ve never heard of.  Galaxy Quest sounds like a sure flop but I’d see it.
After The Green Mile, Sam had my attention. He can play so many roles. No fear of getting typecast here.
He’s so hot ❤️
way too many commercials.
Guy Fleegman. That is it.
what no Choke???????
"Is there air!? You don't know!" -Galaxy Quest Favorite Rockwelll quote of all time.
WHAT! No Gentlemen Broncos?! Also, The Way Way Back is one of my favorite coming of age stories, but there's probably not much to talk about with that role.
3 Billboards is a great movie!! He portraits a perfect villain and redemption theme!!
He doesn't mention in but a fun role where he and Steve Carell respectively went against 'type' is "The Way Way Back". Rockwell gets to play the nice guy, Carell the creep. Really wonderful coming of age movie.
Невероятный актер! Выбор ролей просто космический! ❤
He feels so genuine in this interview, no overly careful language, no excessive compliments, just a lot of casual answers. Love it.
No way we didn’t even go over the magnum opus that is Gentleman Broncos. Absolutely disgusted. Sam, I love you
He's so untethered, it's amazing when he plays a roll you want to love. He knows how to access the crazy while keeping the personality intact.
Justin Theroux is a scriptwriter?!?
No Jojo Rabbit?
really liked his crazy hitman movie with anna kendrick.
No Teenage Ninja Turtles?
I have never not been entertained by Sam Rockwell's performances. A great actor 👏
no love for Captain K?
“I’m just jazzed to be on the show! “
I didn't realize he was so many great characters!
I think his Green Mile character is closest to the real him.😂
I clicked this SO fast. I love Sam! I had suuuuuch a crush on him. I went on a Rockwell vendor like seven or eight years ago so I’ve got some catching up to do but by far the weirdest and most simple movie he’s ever done in my opinion was Lawn dogs - costarring a very young Mischa Barton - her first on screen role. Its genre is called, like… fantasy/surreal/real life or something. I’d never seen IMDB label a movie that way before.
Class actor. He can literally play anything. 👌🏼❤️
Nothing happens in Moon but you cant take your eyes off it!
Galaxy Quest…… GUY!    The BEST!!!
He was absolutely fantastic in hitchhikers guide to the galaxy
Where is Captain K in Jojo Rabbit? He's the best character in that film!
The only other actor I think who could of done Beetlejuice
Galaxy Quest is one of thebmost underappreciated movies of all time.
UNDENIABLY the greatest character actor of our generation. Perfection
Winning season was an excellent film he did.
Hello wolf
Galaxy Quest. What's a great film.
Him in the green mile....outstanding
I liked him in teenage mutant ninja turtles he really had a full character story
Moon. Needs to be talked about more. So does galaxy quest.
Galaxy Quest! My fave
yea. but did he dance in the green mile?
The Assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert Ford
Sam really nailed that movie The Way Way Back
Matchstick Men doesn't even get a mention?
I never knew Sam was my favourite actor until watching this interview 😅 The Green Mile was by far his best role 😊
He seriously brought the green mile to the next level.
Sam in Moon was for me by far his biggest iconic role
I liked Sam in a movie called Heist back in 2001.   Wish he did more dancing scenes though.   So cool to watch
Sam Rockwell is so underrated he is absolutely a fantastic actor one of the best out there❤
I think his role in green mile showed his great talent
did you just say Christopher Walken was a great actor? WTF he plays the same character in every movie.  I like him but a great actor No not really.
Really you guys didn’t bring up that he was the leader of the foot clan in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1990
Way way back loved Sam in that
Great actor
Anyone else think Sam would make a great Steve Marriott of the Small Faces? Would love aee him play Steve in a Bio Film 🙏🙏
This list is missing Bronco/Brutus.
Three Billboards, Moon, and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind - the perfect trifecta of Rockwell movies.
Spoiler alert for moon
Ninja turtles ⭐
My favourite actor, will watch anything he's in
Moon was brilliant.. Should have won an Oscar.
No “choke” on the list?
Great chemistry between Sam and Nick Cage in "Matchstick Men" !!!!
Been a fan ever since I saw him in "Box of Moonlight" with Johnny Torturro.
First time i noticed Sam was in galaxy quest i remember saying that guy is gonna be a star, i think he is seriously underappreciated and if you haven't seen Moon check it out
“Did a lot of cool movies” …and was oftentimes the coolest thing in them. 🔥
can someone tell me how to edit green screen interviews like these
Massively underrated actor ❤🎉
Gary Oldman as an actor. Willem Dafoe is an incredible actor. This guy is so bad I forgot his name. 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Daniel Day-Lewis is an actor and even Vince Vaughn can act but this guy….??? No. NOPE
Voice of Darwin is heard and as today. On 0:48
Imho one of the best actors!
One of my favorite actors 😊
confessions of a dangerous mind awesome movie
Moon is one of the best sci-fi movies ever with haunting soundtrack too
An actors actor.....shout out to Justin Theroux 🎉🎉🎉
Sam Rockwell is so underrated😊😊😊
Moon was an incredible film
Wow. I’ve never been able to watch Sam Rockwell in anything because I had him confused with Gary Oldman, who played the cop villain in Leon, the professional. That role completely freaked me out and I hated him so I avoided watching Sam Rockwell, because they sure do look similar. Love some of the movies on this list, so it was particularly difficult to watch them.
Ninja Turtles anyone?
My goodness, how did you guys forget that he was in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie?
I figured "MATCHSTICK MEN" would he on here...
I can’t get enough of Sam Rockwell. 🔥☺️
My mom hates him cuz of Green Mile ❤😂 she doesn't accept its just a character
We loved Argyle. I don't think I've ever seen a movie he is in I didn't like
Moon is a gem.  Anyone reading this that hasn't seen it, go watch it now!
That mimicry of George W is magnificent
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford
I’d have been curious to hear him talk about his collaborations with Jared Hess
He's awesome l!
love him in Bad Guys too cute
The green mile was hands down Sam's best performance
And nothing about his iconic...nah pivotal...role in TMNT.  Sad....
Rockwell is a phenomenal actor. JoJo Rabbit was a great example.
Moon is one of the most underrated, underappreciated films of modern times.  It's really special.
13:55 he’s just this guy, you know?
Gentlemen Broncos.
Extremely talented actor. 💯
Argyle… really? He could’ve broken down The Bad Guys.
Mathew McConaughey wasn’t in Point Break.
Guy!!
He's still by far my favourite MCU villain
He's still by far my favourite MCU villain
I love how he watches other movies to inform his characters. It's the mark of a true cinephile.
I was sorry to see his performance in the film,  "Jo Jo Rabbit" wasn't mentioned. He should have won an Oscar for best supporting actor, for that role.
Sam Rockwell the G.O.A.T
His performance as Charlie Ford should have been here. He easily held his own with Casey Affleck and Brad Pitt
Galaxy Quest sequel! Yes, please!
Brutus
Sam Rockwell so handsome so bad What an actor
Jojo Rabbit
That shirt though😮
There should be a 'Part Two' video for Sam Rockwell's roles. This was a nice snapshot, but there was so much more that should've been included.
Matchstick men is another great movie
Fantastic actor.
Moon is a masterpiece!
Sam is that dude
So no tmnt?
Moon was the best
First saw him in an indie film called 'Lawn dogs'. Love this guy ever since. Incredible character actor.
Just look up any Sam Rockwell movie and enjoy.
He could be the new BEETLEJUICE ! 100%
His performance in The Assassination of Jesse James by The Coward Robert Ford was 10/10 how could you not include it! what a shame.
Huge fan. Love you Sam keep it up
One of my favorite actors. It helps that he has those moves! So much charm and emotion.
i wish they would of had him talk about his performance in Richard Jewell.
He was despicable in green mile
Welcome To Collinwood is his greatest role. Pero Mahalovic!
Sam Rockwell is a beast of an actor.
I have always really liked him, he adds so much to a movie. While certainly not an "iconic" role of his, I genuinely love his character in "The Way Way Back" (with Steve Carell, Allison Janney, Maya Rudolph). One of the rare times where he plays a truly wholesome character, (and where Steve Carell plays a real jerk of a character).
wild bill was a very unlikeable character but i couldn't help but love the performance..thats when u know u have a great actor
Discovered him in the great film, box of moonlight. Been following his career ever since
how the fuq isn't Gentlemen Bronco's NOT in this list???? FOOK YOU
The Way Way Back is quintessential Sam Rockwell.
Okay Sam Rockwell well I hate his mug he's overrated extremely!!!!
"Regular or Menthol?"
But i like him in "Richard jewell"
ARE WE GOING TO JUST PRETEND THAT GENTLEMEN BRONCOS DOESNT EXIST?   Me watching this comp and being denied Gentlement Broncos:  "I'm not seeing it.  I'm not seeing results.  All I see is a bunch of organic waste."
Make Yeast Lords a real movie.
Forgot to discuss Gentlemen Broncos!
Wag the dog is an underrated film Sam was in !!! I know the subject matter was probably a reason it wasn’t on this list !!!
Really enjoyed this  but unfortunately they're not on long enough as I want to watch about more films he's been in ,and the same with other actors on this show too.
Yeah Sam!!! thank you
Galaxy quest he’s got the best lines
How did you forget, Welcome to Collinwood.
Mr Wolf is that you
Love Rockwell! Though, charming, creepy, silly etc, as an actor, he could be whoever you want. If Downy hadn’t been around, he would have been a fine IronMan too.
Where's Gentleman Bronco?!
Bar b que me and You! Loved the green mile his best part ever!
Im so glad Sam Rockwell has gotten his recognition  -he is an underrated actor who has been working for a long time. One of my favorites is Lawn Dogs with a very young Mischa Barton. Even if the movies not great you know he is giving 100 percent all the time whether its a small part or not
What? No mention of 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford'? Charley Ford is easily his best role.
This guy is such an underappreciated actor. He's incredible in everything he's in.
Guy Fleegman......fuqn legend😊
I just love seeing Sam act. He is one of the best character actors in the business.  He reminds me of the late great Harry Dean Stanton, among others.
I never saw that Eric Knox coming, I loved the twist.
They forgot him in the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie.
Hitch hiker guide to the universe is great I love him in that! And I love him in gentlemen broncos. He is amazing. I hope he does more rolls like that.
The heist with Gene hackman?
Moon is absolutely brilliant and the OST is amazing.
All i wanted was a bit of cornbread you MF
Sam Rockwell is one of those guys where IF you could write a movie you found a way to put him in it. To this day I still quote Guy "Look around you can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe."
It's funny that he mentioned Snow Angels. One of his best IMO. It's very bleak and utterly amazing. 2007 was a great Rockwell year. Snow Angels, Joshua, The Assassination of Jesse James - surprised no of those made it. He is one of them King Midas actors though, this could take about 3 hours.
One of my favorite actors…..
will never forget him in Gentlemen Broncos. What a GEM
Amazing very talented actor.  I love him in every movie he has been in.
don"t forget Welcome to collinwood.
im pretty sure gentleman broncos should have been on this list
"Regular, or menthole?"
No ninja turtles ?
Gentlemen Broncos!
The way way back!
One of my favorites sam is so great
Love Sam forever! Moon is a fav
I remember seeing him in Clownhouse when it came out.  Classic
Ohhhhhhhhhhh.....one of my all-time favorite actor.
"you sweet on me or sum'in?!"-Billy the kid  john Coffey punished them baaad men..
Had me way back in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  Box of Moonlight, Charlie's Angels, The Green Mile.  Guy steals every movie.
Not even a mention on Jojo rabbit?
Moon was great - hard to carry a movie solo but you did.
Seven Psychopaths is a brilliant film Sam was excellent and definitely the best character.
👍 AMAZING actor!!!!!
snores. what a bore.
"He's cookin' now!"
Sam would have been a great ironman.
Sam Rockwell rocks, love his movies.
He is brilliant
Sam's  respectfulness to all he worked with him throughout his career is tip top.  Very talented and genuine actor to his craft.  He always brings curiousness and anticipation to each and every role he portrays.
Fantastic actor , absolutely fantastic 👍
Box of Moonlight.
his best presidential role was hitchhikers
Gentlemen Broncos?
Galaxy Quest... haven't seen the movie in years. Just hilarious.😂
This guy is amazing.
I'm so disappointed there was no mention of his small but memorable role in the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie.
Incredibly underrated actor
Gentlemen. Broncos. Where is it?
I would love to hear him reflect on Gentlemen Broncos
The Way Way Back! He's great in that. And it's an awesome screenplay, too.
"There's a red thingy.. moving towards the green thingy..."    "I think we're the green thingy..😢"  😂
Box full of moonlight and Lawn Dogs.
Dont open that! It's an alien planet! Is there air?! You don't know!
Between him, Alan Rickman and Gary Oldman (to name a few greats) what an honor to have seen these guys on the big screen, such talent.
Gentlemen Broncos not on the list ?
Great Actor...! You should see his dancing skills! real class and style 😁👍
What no Gentleman Broncos
Liked his role in Charlie Angels!
“Favreau” “my partner Leslie Bibb” “my buddy Justin Theroux” ladies we will NEVER stand a chance lol. He’s the coolest… like he literally is.
This video needs to be at least 4 times as long. 17 minutes just isn't enough.
Even supporting roles like Jojo Rabbit and The Green Mile he was fantastic
If they ever make a movie about the evil that was Charlie Manson, they must hire Sam. He would play it perfect.
the winning season is a hidden sam rockwell gem
No Gentlemen Broncos!?
The Way Way Back my favorite.
I’ll watch any movie that Sam is in.
So deserved that he won an oscar too
My favourite actor of all times. Confessions is such a great movie and Sam made it even greater.
Any movie hes in he steals the show. Not many actors can do that naturally
I gotta go rewatch Galaxy Quest. Such an underrated film
How do they not include Matchstick Men?
He was absolutely fn hilarious in Seven Psychopaths. If you haven't seen it yet definitely go and find it.
I was waiting for Matchstick Men.
I loved him in Galaxy Quest, but, though I've seen many of the other movies, I did not know it was him. He is sooo versatile!
The “earwig” is the most underrated tool on a set believe me lol
Sam Rockwell easily one of the most underrated actors. I absolutely love every role he has played especially in the green mile
No Bronco / Brutus? For shame, one of his best roles. Take me to your Yeast Factory.
We certainly don’t see enough of this fabulous actor x
Choke!
Mr wolf
NO GENTLEMEN BRONCOS?!??!
This guy and Walton Goggins are probably two of the most underrated actors today. Both have been at it forever and I'm glad they've been getting more recognition the past few years.
Great actor. And also smart - I like how analytical he is...
His capacity for awaking hate or love in the characters he plays amazes me.
Gentlemen bronco????!!!!!
I loved the movie Matchstick Men.  Rockwell and Cage have a wonderful repor.
I was here for Poltergeist 👻  😢 boo,  dudes...
The way way back was gold
Absolutely a stud actor
Gakaxy quest
GENTLEMEN BRONCOS! HELLO!!!? you gotta be kidding me
Freakin love everything Sam does
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I have to admit Galaxy Quest is my favorite!
What a about the way way back. Or Conviction. His role in Conviction was such a great part. He was such a powerful role in Conviction.
What? No “Gentleman Bronco”? He was so great in that one. “You stole my nads Dennis!”
Gentleman Broncos
Galaxy Quest, freakin HILARIOUS movie
One of the best actors out there! Very underappreciated.
Moon...the best film !!!!!
I fell in love with Sam Rockwell while watching The way way back, such a wholesome movie❤
I loved his role in Matchstick Men. Under the radar film that was actually excellent where the bad guy wins. Wish they would have talked to him about it.
One of the greatest actors in the history of mankind. Along with Daniel Day-Lewis and Tom Hardy.
Sam Rockwell is one of the most under appreciated actors to have ever acted. He is definitely iconic. I would love to have a coffee with the guy.
Galaxy Quest is a masterpiece.
The Search for One-Eye Jimmy
Box of Moonlight!  Great film Sam.
Love love LOVE this fella ..✌🏻
Rockwell is one of the finest actors of his generation, always knocks his roles out of the park.
He's just the best.
"You dont always have the time to prep"' he says after visiting burn victims.... like they chose the time to have experienced one of the worst things ever. BUT HE IS AN ACTOR FEEEEEL HIS DEDICATION AND PAIN.
Every time I’ve ever held two small boxes and it happens more often than you would think. I have to say “regular or menthol.” no one gets it at all when I do
He is one of those actors who can be in a film and you don't realize he is in it until the credits. Hitchhiker's Guide.
Wonderful actor. “Welcome to Collinwood” was the first film to see
Matchstick Men
Seriously no Matchstick men?
I always like sam rockwell in movies. A few of his characters remind me of dwight yoakham
i remember when I first realized that artists build on top of other artists - I appreciate Rockwell’s honesty.
Sam Rockwell is one of my favorite actors!! Love him!!
Moon is pure genius and more people need to know about it
Bronco
Wild bill wharton left.a big impact on me in green mile. John coffey was my absolute favorite. But wild bill swinging around his cell is a major scene ill never forget.
I even liked him in ninja turtles 🐢
Gentleman Bronco
If they did a sequel or series for Galaxy Quest, I would be all in for that! Loved that movie, just watched it couple weeks ago lol
Watch him in a single shot.
Wow. I'll admit I've only seen him in the green mile but to see clips of his other characters he really is such a great actor. Xx
Wait a second.... where's *GENTLEMEN BRONCOS* ?????
Yeah but what about Gentleman Broncos
The Way Way Back 👌
Where is Gentlemen Broncos?
Justin Hammer is played by Sam Rockwell who is played by Dana Carvey.
They didn't do gentlemen broncos.😭
R Iconic: Character 🎭😱
His best movie was neglected!!!! Gentleman Broncos
Does not mention gentlemen Broncos?
Love you Sam!! You're awesome
There's not a movie i don't believed he nailed the role in  !!!!!
Best role ever was bronco the yeast lord 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wanted him to mention the way way back..
Sam was not once asked about his iconic role in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Somebody please tell him to change his stylist)) that hairstyle, like he just woke up
JUST MORE SAM ROCKWELL!!!  Sort it OUT please PLEASE!!  ❤❤❤❤👍🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I hated Rockwell in Green Mile, I was never going to watch him again, the dude is in awesome actor I swear it ❤
OT MENTIONING HIS ICONIC PRE FAME CAMEO IN TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES IS OUTRAGEOUS
Umm, Gentleman Broncos?  Hello, his finest role!
PLEASE MORE GALAXY QUEST!!!!!!
" I just jazzed without being on the show" 😂😂😂
with out like this artist hollywood is nothing
One of my favorite actors, Sam Rockwell! Would have been nice to have the movies listed in chronological order—we can watch how he grows, evolves.
No Captain  K???   WTF????????????????????????????????????????????????
7 psychopaths is one of my favorite movies of all time
Not as iconic of a breakdown as my breakdown of one of my most iconic characters.
His most iconic rol for me will always be in the TMNT 1990 movie !!!!
so sad that the way way back wasn't mentioned
no mention of Bronco? 😂
Thanks for throwing out a few lesser known roles at the end. Im going to find" moon "and watch it
What about his finest cinematic acheivement in Gentlmen Broncos??????
AN ICON INDEED!!!!
Should get an Oscar for "Best of Enemies" ------they all should
Moon is one of the best movies ever made.
I lovd Rockwell but too many commercials on this video
Who else is here to see Gentlemen Broncos?
One smaller movie that he did that was quite odd but so captivating was Choke, with Angelica Houston and Kelly Macdonald
As a huge Stephen King fan, I can confirm The Green Mile is very true to the book and just an absolute joy to watch.
He was brilliant in Confessions of a dangerous mind.
Gentlemen Broncos not being on this list is criminal. Love Sam.
Does he talk about Gentleman Broncos?
Sad that Gentleman Broncos was not brought up.
After seeing his character in Green Mile it put me off and got me not to like his other films he's done.
I didn’t even realize that was the same guy 😮
Matchstick men
I would watch the bejesus out of a Galaxy Quest series. Get back the original writers, keep politics out of it and just focus on funny. It'd be a hit
Galaxy Quest 2? TAKE MY MONEYYYYY!
0:21 tell me that line isnt written for owen wilson. I cant un-hear it in his voice now XD
No Richard Jewell???  Fail!
I love everything I have seen him in
Awesome actor. I never really to looking to watch his movies but when he’s in a movie his acting is always top notch.
"Better Living Through Chemistry"  is another hilarious  movie with S.R.
only reason i watched Ironman Multiple times.
What about Bronco in Gentlemen Broncos?!
In Green Mile I think he’s like Sid Viscous
Hitchhiker's Guide is my favorite story of all time. I liked the movie, but it definitely didn't do the book justice
This is exactly why Sam Rockwell is on my list. You know, if you know.
Sam Rockwell for President of the Universe!!!!!!
Captain K whoooooo
Loved him as charlie ford
I love this dude
Too bad they didn't get into Where's Johnny. Rockwell will have you in the floor as the son who goes down to the basement to do laundry and gets locked in the basement apartment.
Way too little on Green Mile.
One of the most underrated actors out there - brilliant guy.
Far and away......GALAXY QUEST.......brilliance......
Super cool .he was so cool in Welcome to Collinwood.. It's a super funny movie and cast.👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
Yeah, but does he dance while he's doing it? That's all I want 2 know.
This guy is amazing in his roles. Green mile scenes were crazy
One of the very few actors whose movies I  will go see with no other recommendation than that he is in it.
Is Steve Earl Sam Rockwell's dad,he's the image of him in Copperhead Road,I think anyway❤
Words won't do justice of how class Sam is.
He really puts his whole mind, body and soul into each character. Amazing actor.
Underrated, brilliant actor
"Steven King did show up to the set. He got in the electric chair for two seconds. He gave us his blessing." A classic Steven King.
I was really hoping he would've brought up Way Way Back. Great movie, and he was awesome in that.
I liked him in Matchstick Men
I can definitely say I did not see it coming in Charlie's Angel's. Huge twist, & I kinda loved it... especially the Sam Rockwell dancing 👍
I believe that he was in TMNT in the early 90's. He was one of the main guys in that underground kids club. He was the guy who, when some kid asked if he had cigarettes, his character said "Regular or Menthol".
Jojo Rabbit???
"regular..or menthol ?"
He solidified his spot as my favorite actor of all time when he did the comedy assassin movie with Anna Kendrick
They're cooking him now, is a favorite quote I use often.
Big fan. Great actors..
"One of the guys in Deliverance is in the Green Mile.  I think he's the executioner.....".  Something so cold about that line, but people are people and he did admit "a bit of Sam in every role".  Nevertheless, he's one of the very top 'Character' actors of this age.  I'd put him in the same 'distinctive' category as Steve Buscemi, Harry Dean Stanton, and Strother Martin.  That's as high praise as I can get.
Come on, no Assassination of Jesse James?
JOJO RABBIT?
My alltime favorite actor...simple as that!
The Way Way Back is a coming-of-age masterpiece. Sam Rockwell is an all-time great.
He was great in Ninja Turtles 1
Never listed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. That's a bummer.
"Box of Moonlight" (1996) with John Turturro is an excellent movie!
Lawn Dogs!
Love him!  I was hoping he would talk about The Way Way Back.  His character is so kind and helpful to the kid.
This guy...our generation's Brando
“Moon” is one of the absolute best movies I’ve ever seen.
Great career
He's amazing how he can BE that character.❤
Wheres Turtles 1990?????
how did they miss Matchstick Men?
Sam is a great fukn actor...I will watch anything he's in. 😎
No mention of 'The Way Way Back'?? He was stellar in that movie. Sam is a powerhouse... He deserves more credit than what he gets (IMO).
Where is Jojo Rabbit....
My favorite role of his was actually in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.. for a supporting character his performance was great.  Whole movies a masterpiece imo
Sam is one of the most criminally underrated actors, and Moon is one of the most criminally underseen movies.
Be cool to play and make that money.  I understand exactly what I said.
The Way Way Back?
He is just entertainment on legs. I don't think he could be unengaging if he tried.
The way, way back is a great film for Sam's natural humor.
Sam is America's Gary Oldman. Incredible range and true professional.
Swoon ❤
Sam Rockwell is a tremendous actor
Seven Psychopaths was SUCH a great flick. So underrated. Love Sam Rockwell
Love Sam Rockwell . One of my favorite movies of course the Green Mile , also he was excellent in the movie " 3 billboards outside of ebbing Missouri."
Love Moon! Amazing film!
Moon and Snow Angels are two of my favorite movies.
No Ninja Turtles!?
Box of Moonlight with John Turturro was another great role.  ❤
I know he's been a brilliant actor for ages before "Three Billboards..." but his acting in that film is phenomenal. It's funny, despicable and beautiful. I cannot believe I was actually rooting for him by the end of it. I feel like that's the kind of role where it's so easy to get it wrong, but Sam Rockwell was absolutely perfect, and he's so deserving of all the accolades he received.
He almost resembles Gary Oldman in appearance.
Regular or menthol?
No mention of Heist? That film is amazing!
looking very Liam Gallagher
Can't believe he didn't discuss his part in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
He did a horror movie in the early 90s called Clown house. Very underrated film.
Oh dang, No "Choke," a personal fav.
Sam's Character on the movie "way way back" is simply amazing.
Iconic iconic iconic!!!
Sam is a rock star.
No Jojo Rabbit? ☹️
He was great in Moon, excellent actor - He was even called Sam in the film :)
If Sam Rockwell won’t say it, I will. Sam Rockwell is iconic. He’s mesmerising  in every movie he’s made. Absolute genius.
He is the best ❤
Most diverse and prolific actors of all time. No matter which role he plays, he unwittingly steals the show and becomes the focus of the scene. A true master.
I love how Sam Rockwell has absolutely no friggin idea what a HUGE universal treasure he is to the larger leviathan that is movie and cinema history. Total legend
9:04🤣  Best entrance of a character....EVER!
His performance in the green mile as wild bill will always be the greatest!
MOON ♥😭
An absolute master of his craft.
One of my favorite Sam Rockwell lines ever. Can you form some kind of rudimentary lathe?
Aw come on, no Gentlemen Broncos or Galaxy Quest?? Boooo hiss
I love Sam. I am always heartbroken when his charismatic character always turns out to be the villain. My goodness… the moves on this guy. I love watching Sam Dance 😻 Sam Rockwell is amazing.
Such an underrated dude
Welcome to Cottonwood was great
I was named after zowie bowie n now hes called duncan jones lol go figure
17 writers for Charlie's Angels ... oh dear
He's been great in everything that I have ever seen him in. Matchstick Men and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford are two more movies that I loved him in.
Sam Rockwell going for the Bill Mosely look.
I wonder if Sam Rockwell would consider playing a role Darren McGavin made his own, Kolchak the Nightstalker ?
But what about 1990 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? 🐢 🍕
Ooooo a Galaxy Quest sequel with Simon Pegg?? SIGN ME UP
Well that was a long list 😅. Yet there's many more. Quite a prolific career.
"I'm around, let's do it!"  (Hawkeye meme) *don't do this...don't give me hope...*
One of my all time favorite actors!!! 💜
See How they Run is fantastic for those who missed it
He is still so hot ❤😊❤
Honestly, the first time I saw you was in the green mile…. I could not shake the image or person you portrayed in that movie EVER. I guess you did your job
He absolutely stole the show on The Green Mile. Sam and the guy who played Percy should've gotten a dual Oscar for Best Supporting Actors.
Moon is fantastic.
I loved him in the green mile
Moon and Three billboards.
I want to know ….dont want to sound creepy, what does Sam smell like
Guy Fleegman. Mmm Guy is the best by a country mile! His role in Gentleman Broncos is also fantastic
Choke... ouch
Sam you are iconic. It's not a question.
Sam Rockwell is my guilty pleasure, but I don't feel guilty at all.
Drunks is one of Sam Rockwell's best!
He was in the original teenage mutant ninja turtles 👍
got any cigarettes? Regular or menthol ?
Captain K.. WHOOOOOO!!!!!
1:38 it wouldn't be a Sam Rockwell performance, unless there is a dance scene!
Lawn Dogs is still one of my favorite movies of his.
Is it just me, or does he remind you/look like James Franco in Galaxy Quest?
Does anyone really want to see Armor Wars? Tony is dead.
The best actor hands down.  I don't even like actors.  He's the exception.
Sam looks like Mick Foley.
4:38 I couldn't watch a Sam Rockwell movie for a very long time after seeing his character in Green Mile, I was so put off by it.
❤🇬🇧🔥
Nothing on TMNT 1990.
Galaxy Quest and Hitchhikers Guide are two of my favorite films of all time. Moon is such an underrated gem too! Rarely seems to be talked about nowadays, but it's such an interesting film, especially if you don't know what the twist is!
Loved Sam as Zephod!
My absolute favorite was Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy where he played President Zaphod Beeblebrox.
Came here to comment MOON.
The way way back was such an underrated movie that I wish more people watched!
MOON FTW
Galaxy Quest was awesome and deserves a sequel. Guy actually really added to the movie. I quote "can you make some kind of rudimentary lathe" all the time. Nobody gets it.
I like so much Sam Rockwell, he played in great films, but my favorite one is "Conviction", hoping to see him in many new films again.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1990 was the first role I saw him in.
I love you Sam❤
Sam Rockwell is not only a fantastic actor (one of the greats) but he is clearly an encyclopedia of cinema. I'd love to know whether he identifies the films he wants to watch to shape a character he is playing or whether he shapes the character based on the films he is watching at the time.
He's always memorable. Brilliant in JoJo Rabbit.
Sam was Hilarious in “Gentlemen Broncos”
3 Billboards.....Sylva nc, I live there
Such a talented actor, any movie that has him in it ,you know your guaranteed an unmissable watch 🎉
My favorite is Box of moonlight.
This guy is one of Americas best actors always delivers in any role, my favourite role he played  being the  crewman in Galaxy Quest.
You’ll never compare him to one of his previous movies! Everything he does is different! Amazing actor and really seems like a great humane person! Great IC I must say ❤
Really underrated actor. Nice guy.
I ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS GUY!
Box of Moonlight. Great film.
If I could see all 3 guys do zaphod I think Sam did the best job
Does anyone know where he got that shirt?
I would like nothing more than simon peg writing a galaxy quest 2
Sam is a terrific actor!  So many movies - loved Matchstick Men
Dangerous mind was phenomenal
TMNT?
Choke?  That was better than Fight Club, and by default you're dismissing Chuck Palahniuk.  Jeezus.  Ditto Matchstick Men.
Cool name!
Box Of Moonlight, Seven Psychopaths. Will watch anything with him in it.
Sam Rockwell is, hands down, the greatest actor working today.
Freaking loved him as Zaphod and his role in JoJo Rabbit
Sam Rockwell isn't an actor. He's a scene stealer!!! Love this guy, wonderful in all his roles.
His performance in The Way Way Back was also phenomenal.
Sam is criminally underrated.
I love Sam, me and my fiancé watch his movies all the time she watches just to see if there’s a scene where he sings or dances😂
criminally underrated actor
He’s really great in the  Assassination OF JESSE JAMES
please watch Box of Moonlight .. Sam is incredibly fun and poetic in this indie film, one of my faves ! !
Sam in Charlies angels remindes me my close friend, looks and way he act. 99 %
The best!
Brilliant actor - love everything he does.
Everything he does is magic.
Seven Psychopaths is hugely underrated movie and Sam carried that one.
The moment this dude started dancing in the Charlie’s Angels movie was the moment I realize this dude was a chameleon. Fooled me in the beginning of the movie and rocked that ending! Talented, is an understatement! You rock Sam!
Moon is my favorite movie of all time. Absolutely amazing.
An absolute legend he brings an amazing elevation to anything he’s in ❤
Seven Psychopaths and Moon are by far his best parts of all time.
I was hoping safemen was on here. Great movie.
Please do more with Galaxy Quest
I like Sam Rockwell, but every roll seems sorta the same
To me, he will always be Guy
Sam Rockwell is my dream drunk dance partner !!
the Behanding in Spokane
You got me. I didn't expect Eric Knox to switch into the smooth bad guy. Sam ALWAYS steals the show in every movie he's in.  Also, Seven Psychopaths was perfect.
A Great ACTOR .
Box of moonlight.   Great movie
One the most underrated actors around.Fantastic
I wish they included The Best if Enemies in here
Gentlemen Broncos?
Criminally underrated actor.
His character on The Babysitter was super funny!! Shouldve made the list!!!
So criminally underrated!
A true talent.  Wish he was in more flics
Super presence in every movie, but such distinct characters that I’ve forgotten some are Sam. I loved him in lawn dogs and ever since, whenever he’s attached to a movie, I’m very happy
I didn't know what to think of Rockwell the first time I saw him act. I thought he was nuts. Needless to say, he a Great actor and if a movie came out with him in it, I watched.
Moon! Brilliant performance.
“…David Gordon Green directed…”  You’re not exactly selling me on that last one, Sam. Sorry.
I don't live by rules. But if a movie has Sam Rockwell in it, it must be watched.
Love Sam Rockwell but Argylle was horrible !
Love you dude.  Youre the best bro
First thing I saw him in was TMNT.
Sam Rockwell, he's a legend, the guy is so underrated ❤❤❤
Gentlemen bronco should’ve been on this list
No "Gentlemen Broncos"??? Missed opportunity
Who picks the “iconic “ movies?
THE #1 MOST UNDERRATED ACTOR OF ALL TIME!
Sam Rockwell is a frikking AWESOME actor!
11:05 “ Someone harmless like Bill gates “ , boy  , that comment did  NOT withstand the test of time lol
No Safe Men, tragedy!
Sam rockwell is it's iconic whether he admits it or not or anyone else does
I just love me some Sam Rockell ! Such a unique actor .
Anyone who Martin McDonagh chooses, and then chooses again for another movie, is an ace in my book.  Rockwell has insane talent, very underrated.
One of the few actors that I will watch a film purely because he is in it, just love him.
My favorite actor
Brilliant actor.
No JoJo Rabbit wtf???
All of these roles and not one mention of ninja turtles.
How do you not add two of Rockwells best performances and films: Matchstick Men and The Way Way Back. I'm so disappointed 😞
I'm actually surprised Hammer wasn't in more of the Marvel movies, as a HYDRA cell, or an arms dealer that supplied HYDRA. I loved the weapons breakdown scene.
Love love him. It doesn’t hurt that he is a great dancer to boot. Way undervalued in the industry. ❤
Been a fan since The Search for One-Eye Jimmy.  😂😂😂
I thought for sure he was Stanley Tucci at the beginning of Argylle
I was really hoping for a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles shout out.
Love Sam Rockwell. Always enjoyable seeing him on screen.
The Way Way Back...
"Regular or Menthol?"
First saw him in glory daze with Ben Affleck... Great actor..
I adore him.
Moon was wild. How could this have been overlooked by the Oscars? Go and see it!
Sam Rockwell was an on-point Zaphod. I would like to have seen the series completed. RIP D Adams.
Everyone forgets his greatest role as the street punk with one line near the end of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (original movie)!!!!
The Way Way Back wasn’t mentioned either. A bloody phenomenal film. Sam is great in everything he does.
The Green Mile will forever be one of my favorite movies of all time.
My partner and I will watch anything with Sam! Don’t even have to ask if we are down.
First saw him in Galaxy Quest and instantly became obsessed. Me and both of my sons.
My favorite movie Sam has done is The Bad Guys.
They missed out on " Box of Moonlight, and the great-- Gentleman Broncos.
Sam rockwell made hitchhikers guide for me, his role was fantastically done, i don't think anyone else could have done it better to be honest.
HE WAS AMAZING IN THREE BILLBOARDS
Sam Rockwell = GOAT
Galaxy Quest 2, movie...series... whatever... Get on it, please.
What about the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie? He was excellent in that :) "Got any cigarettes?" " Regular or menthol?"
I absolutely love Sam Rockwell! My favorite actor ❤
Box of Moonlight...wonderful in it
One of his first leading parts was in a film called 'Box of Moonlight'  he's amazing in it.
When is Hollywood going to do an Appalachian accent correct?
"Box of Moonlight" is still, and always will be my favorite movie of his. If you have not seen it and are a fan of his, it is a MUST SEE.
What about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?!
Hard to pick among them but "Moon" is, for me, his most iconic role. Amazing.
Why didn't you bring up Teenage mutant Ninja turtles?
Thought JoJo Rabbit would've been in there somewhere.
First saw this guy in the first TMNT movie
Were on an alien planet is there air?! You dont know!!!
"harmless kinda like Bill Gates"  LOL
Along with Daniel Day Lewis and Joaquim Phoenix, one of my favourite actors.
3 billboards jesse james oscar worthy
The fact Sam made a cameo of 5 secs in a shortfilm of the Mandarin means he could fix the next MCU series xDD
Moon is master piece! Top10 science fiction movies of all times
No batman?
One of the most underrated character actors ever in my opinion.
No mention of Safe Men.  That was one of his first movies and it was fantastic!
Moonlight in a box was great, too.
0:30 TIL that Leslie Bibb was his partner & Justin Theroux wrote on IM2 🤯
No disrespect to Josh Brolin but Sam Rockwell was a better George Dubya than George Dubya.
probably the most criminally underrated actor of our time
When can u get Brad Pitt???
I hope Justin Hammer makes a return.
Little town 😂 his neck snapped back he backpedaled so fast!
Even Sam couldn’t save that train wreck of a movie Argylle…
He’s great.
Great actor and Moon is just the one, what a movie and to hold a captive audience on your own for an entire film, is an impressive feat to say the least! 🤌🙌💪
A very grounded and real person - capable of elevating any character to the highest standards of the craft. Love this guy.
How could he leave out 5th Element and Gentlemen Broncos? Love all of them!
Amazing actor! ❤😊
Galaxy quest sequel would actually be insane.
“Moon” is 10/10 sci fi, the same way Alien and The Thing are 10/10, perfectly paced movies.
I was most impressed by his performance in Richard Jewel
Lawn Dogs is definitely worth a watch if you're interested in early, early Rockwell.
Loved him in seven psychopaths
Moon is a very fine performance. So crafted
No Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
I definitely appreciate Sam.
I wanted to hear him talk about Jesse James, i think hes great in that.
Were is Matchstick Men?!!!! Great movie with great performances!
box of moonlight
I still remember his acting in the original teenage mutant ninja turtles movie
He’s phenomenal.
I really like the movie he did with Nic Cage
I wish he talked more about Moon, one of my all time favorites, the soundtrack is so great too and just such a well written script, love it!
Box of Moonlight is one of my favorites.
No coverage for his role in the OG Ninja Turtles film?   "Regular or Menthol?"
Box of Moonlight.....
This was great but you missed True Romance!
Always look closely at the people who keep ranting about "danger to democracy". Democracy is the last thing they care about. They're just the soft handed folks in society who are scared they might have to get their hands dirty for a living once this country is fixed.
Box of Moonlight.
I think his best was Confessions. Box of Moonlight with John Turturo was one of his best too.
Argyle is too recent to be in this list
Best actor going round… with Gary Oldman. Love everything they do.
Just saw Argylle last weekend. Such an awesome movie! Sam Rockwell is just fantastic.
Sam Rockwell is an amazing character actor. He's up there with Gary Oldman.
Would love a Galaxy Quest sequel.
A HITCHHIKERS GUIDE THROUGH THE UNIVERSE, 'Nuff said!
Where’s Matchstick Men!!! I love that flick
It's great to see you still got it Sam! 💟
Oh, what I'd give for a sequel to Galaxy Quest.
MOON!
Moon is one of my favorites.
The first one I saw was The green mile and i couldnt see him as anyone else for yearsssss!!
This guy has been my favorite actor since I saw Confessions of a Dangerous Mind in early 2000s.
Sam Rockwell. You can call your characters iconic all day.  I think you're iconic.
I'm disappointed they didn't do Jerry and Tom
Peter Dinklage in a little town? Lol... Little town... Get it... Just barely
Him in Richard Jewell, Frost/Nixon... so many memorable roles
I love him so much. ❤❤❤❤
He forgot small role in tmnt 1990
The movie moon WOULD NOT have worked with a lesser actor. Sam Rockwell should have won EVERY award for moon. If you haven't seen it stop what your doing and go watch it, when done thank Sam with a thumbs up on this. Moon will always be in my top ten just behind the film everything everywhere all at once.
Don Verdean, Lawn Dogs, Collinwood, The Sitter. It is unfortunate that there was no comments regarding those, particularly Don Verdean.
He has a normal head. 🐶
Very sadly missed out  gentlemen broncos that's a fantastic film
Is he in the middle of a Mick Foley bio pic?
Without doubt one of my most favourite of actors!
7 Psychopaths!
No Gentlemen Broncos???
His voice is soo recognizable i have always loved this mans acting. He makes a villain look cool and his delivery is just on point!
"Remember boys, Flys spread disease... so keep yours closed." He was my favorite part of band of brothers and I liked all those guys.
How could you skip Box of Moonlight?! ♥
I loved his character in GALAXY QUEST!
The Way Way Back needed to be part of this!
I didn't know the hot reporter he was pathetically hitting on in the movie WAS HIS PARTNER, lmfao. That's great.
Um where's the recognition of The Way Way back?  Such a great movie and Sam was great in it.
10:18 Let's do it.
Galaxy Quest was awesome 👌
No JoJo Rabbit?
Confessions of a dangerous mind easily one of my favorite movies ever
Rockwell is a fabulous dancer.
Saw him in a small part in Strictly Business and knew this guy was going to be great. Nice career for him in the 30 years since then.
Amazing actor!!
Sam Rockwell is an actor!
Really shocked they didn’t include The Way Way Back.
Great..like GREAT actor
my son is 10 and he loves to dance like sam ,amazing actor
Hitchhikers guide...nuff said. haha loved him in that.
There was the chance for a LIMITED SERIES OF GALAXY QUEST!!!! SOMEONE TELL SIMON PEG WE NEED IT NOW!!!!!
I love Sam Rockwell movies.
I am a huge fan of Sam Rockwell. Top notch actor.
sam rockwell<3 his craft is one of a kind.
Galaxy Quest, underrated. Moon, one of the best ever. Sam Rockwell: Winner!
до чего же он охуенный!
Zaphod Beeblebrox for president.
this guy might be the most real unpretentious actor ever.
Moon is my all time favorite movie.
Moon..he should have won an Oscar for that one.
I adore Sam Rockwell. He is so underrated and/or overlooked.
What about his role in Jo Jo Rabbit?!   That was amazing.
Sam is one of the best and my favorites. Moon changed my view of cinema.
He makes acting looks like so easy, he's truly one of the best actors
Love Rockwell but that GWB performance was pure cringe -- especially compared to bale's cheney
Gentlemen Broncos is such an underrated movie and Rockwell does great in it.
2 THESSALONIANS 1:6
Dope
moon was the movie that made me a fan of sam
What, no mention of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?!
Easily the best character actor of our time.  Underrated Legend.
Regular or Menthol?
I remember liking Choke when it came out.
I don’t know what “little bit of Sam” works it way into all his roles. But he could be my brother.
The longer it’s been, the better Justin Hammer becomes
Me encantaaa, faltó Jojo Rabit 😢
he always surprises :)
Sam Rockwell as Guy in Galaxy Quest is my favorite ❤
A laid back Masterclass.....:0)
Charlie’s Angels >>>>
The assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. He is amazing in that.
It is time to stop saying partner. You have boyfriends, girlfriends, husbands and wives. No partners.
Snow Angels. I watched it twice.
Absolutely criminal that his Jojo Rabbit character wasn’t mentioned. Easily my favorite role he’s ever done, especially during his last scene.
he did such a stand out job in greenmile
Box of moonlight?!?!?
My all time favorite actor - the guy is more talented than most people realize.
Box of Moonlight,, ... Anybody?
someone make a deepfake with sam being tony stark imo he would do great
such an underrated actor...to me anyways...
box of moonlight and  safe men
Time to get Tom Cruise 😉
Of course I loved Galaxy Quest, but I also really liked Moon.  Sam really got to exercise his chops as the different clones.
I'd put Sam Rockwell up there with Gary Oldman. Both men who can truly do almost anything on the screen and make you forget its them. Remarkable actor. Was surprised not to see Jojo Rabbit on this list. Probably my favorite role of his.
Many is the time that knowing Rockwell is in a film decided whether to see it or not. He's always on target. Undercelebrated in my opinion.
How is Mr. Nice Guy not on here wtf!
Can't believe the amount of movies I would call absolute classics Rockwell has been in, and I never noticed it was the same person! Brilliant acting!
Better Living Through Chemistry is an all time favorite of mine.
His character in the green mile  made me hate him to this day 😅 I know it’s not him but that character is so despicable and he played it too well
I make a point to watch every Sam Rockwell film I come across. He's my favorite actor.
True master
I love Sam in movies like 3 billboards, and Jojo Rabbit but when he just mentioned Ironman 2 my jaw dropped because I thought OF COURSE THAT IS SAM but he is so different there, his character is so different that, in my head, that was a lookalike, another person, someone else.
I think marvel is often suuuper lazy but I just assumed singing planet had dancing scarf weapons... Aesthetics wise
Great actor. Please get Sam L Jackson if you guys can or D
Matchstick Men bro. Matchstick Men. One of my favorite movies of all time.
How is Matchstick Men not in here!?!?!?
When i think of Sam Rockwell, I think of "Moon", and then "The Green Mile". I love that guy.
Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Galaxy.
Great range!
pretty much my favourite actor ever
those early mcu movies were fantastic. sam rockwell, nick nolte, and jeff bridges turned in the best performances!
The Way Way Back is the quirky movie role for him where I fell in love with his acting!
Very disappointed they they didn't include Clownhouse (1989)
I remember being blown away by moon
I had never really thought about it, but he could probably have played Tony Stark.
Lawn Dogs.
SEQUEL TO GALAXY QUEST???
The world was absolutely robbed by not getting a Galaxy Quest sequel done by Simon Pegg!
No gentlemen broncos 😔😔😔
A great actor. Will always watch a film he is starring in.
Such an interesting actor. Shame on me I always forget about him, then he shows up on screen and I'm stoked he's there because there will be at least one interesting thing about the movie I'm watching.
I dig Sam rockwell, and Jon Favero(sp) but no one gives a singular F about Ironman or any of these other horrendous comic book action movies, they're all shyte.
I loved him in Jojo Rabbit
I can't believe he didn't mention Choke.
I hope you and Leslie return together in the MCU someday. What a great career. movies we still watch today. Great actor.
Disappointed to not see Jojo Rabbit here
Every movie this dude shows up in is better for the fact that he showed up!  💯😎
anybody else see Batman's head in the M in Moon? (15:34)
"I'm around, let's do it" is such a rad mindset.
Saved the best for last.
I read this as, "Sam Rockwell breaks down: his most iconic roles"... Cus he always seems to be breaking down... Get it? 🤭
Sam Rockweel is Fantastik... my favorite. used to see him in a restairant called Flinders lane. gaw such a big fan...
where was gentlemen broncos? lol
He pretty much made the whole Argyle movie.
His best role will always be the live action TMNT movie that came out in 1990
box of moonlight my favorite
fun fact, Sam Rockwell is a character played by Gary Oldman.
Where's the rest of his movies?
OMG, A Galaxy Quest series/sequel?  Yes?  PLEASE!?
Vic in f is for family didn't even get a mention!
Oh I loved him in jojo rabbit
Regular? or Menthol?
3 Billboards is one of the best movies of all time
"Is there air? - YOU DON'T KNOW!!!!"
refreshing indeed to see an actor just wanting to be an actor.
One of my favorite actors!❤️🤗🐝
No Gentleman Broncos?
Now I want to watch Galaxy Quest. That would be awesome if Pegg helped em out and they got the thing made - very doubtful - but I can hope.
No Jojo Rabbit?
Barbecue, me and you,  stinky pinky pew pew pew!
ok, where is that galaxy quest series?!
WOW this dude is a chameleon! I knew that I really liked him but I was surprised to see he played some roles I knew of but had no idea it was him! That is a sign of a truly talented actor. Mind blowing!
A Simon Pegg produced Galaxy Quest limited series would be amazing.
Every dude needs Sam Rockwell as a best friend. Not even joking. Such a heart felt understanding guy.
I really enjoy all his characters. Great actor.
I love his characters so insane
HE DIDNT MENTION TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES???????
I've heard of like two of these movies. These 'iconic' things are getting ridiculous. You're watering down words...
I always loved his character in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
Box of Moonlight is one of my favorites
There is brilliance, and there is Sam Rockwell brilliance. I'd pay money just to hear him read names out of a telephone book.
Straight up legend!
Honestly he’s the best.
BEST ROLE not mentioned...  BOX OF MOONLIGHT.  See it.  Don't look at the trailer, don't read about it- just watch it.
Such a cool guy.. under rated actor.
A Galaxy Quest series would be amazing!!
Karl With A K.
He forgot TMNT. "Cause we're loyal to the Shredder!" I love this guy.
Sam Rockwell, Mads Mikkelsen, and Ben Mendelsohn are my absolute favorites.  Anything with either of those actors in it is a must watch.
They didn't mention The Way Way Back that I really liked.
What about SAFE MEN?????!!!!  You nailed that role along with an amazing cast!  SAFE MEN   SAFE MEN!!!!
How did this not include Jojo Rabbit?!?!
TMNT sammy was perfect.. they were a family
Sam, I love u❤
how was Matchstick Men not on that list?
The Green Mile with an excellent flick
When I'm reminded Sam Rockwell exists, I remember he's my favorite actor. YKWIM?
You heard him go watch The Winning Season
I know he was in a lot of films, but I am sad they couldn’t include his thoughts on Jojo’s Rabbit. Such a heartbreaking movie, and he played a great surrogate, father figure.
Did Sam Rockwell just call Patrick Swayze.... Matthew McConaughey, or did he confuse Dazed and Confused with Point Break,  Or was it editing's fault?
Loved him in "Moon" and "The Way, Way Back"
Matchstick Men is my fave.
i clicked for galaxy quest
They should have asked about Ninja Turtles.
He is so underrated so is his wife
He forgot TMNT 1990😊🐢. He got a small part in that movie.
Was blown away by a small budget film called, “A Single Shot.” One of his darkest films and characters. Sam is a remarkable talent.
I was hoping to see The Way Way Back in here. Might be my favorite performance of his.
"Box of moonlight"....great movie if you've never seen it!!!  Sam and John Turturro played perfect opposites!!!
Definitely an amazing actor. Quite a few of my favorite ones of his in his list.
They failed to include The Way Way Back
I would 100% watch a Galaxy Quest mini series thing.
Galaxy quest and Hitchhikers guide are both my all time favorite movies i want more of them so bad and ive been waiting years.
Absolutely LOVE Sam Rockwell. Sad Matchstick Men didn’t make this list.
Sam Rockwell is one of the very rare actors where I enjoy every roll they do.
Sam Rockwell's post-teleporter scream is always going to be in my top 100 movie moments.
Guy Fleegman is a classic.
A horribly overlooked movie is "welcome to collinwood"....  it is one of the funniest B movies ever made with an amazing cast
Can't believe he didn't talk about Gentleman Bronco.
I show up for YOU, Sam Rockwell.
Where is Jojo Rabbit? Unexpectedly wonderful movie with profound meaning
Learn how to pronounce Appalachian.
great interview!
Weird they didn’t mention Best Enemies
WHAT ABOUT TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES? 1990!
Sam never seems to be first in line for roles but ALWAYS nails it
Galaxy Quest is one of the most underrated comedies of all time. I’d love to Simon Pegg in a sequel
I don't know why, but I will always remember him in the live action TMNT. "Menthol or regular?"
was hoping for jojo rabbit
this actor should have played Deadpool, he would have shown what bouzumie is)
I got Sam Rockwell and Edward Norton confused, I was expecting a Rounders breakdown
Guy has a mind like a trap for recalling details
Seven Psychopaths. What a 10/10 film.
this has to be the most depressing episode of this series.
Osteen's sh**-eating grin proves once again that there's no such thing as bad press.
chuck barris had a manly face, like Rex Harrison, William Holden, the kind they don't make anymore. Deep dimples, hairy chest... Tony Shaloub, maybe.
✨✌️🤩✌️✨
7 psychopaths is unreal.
Wow I didn't realize how many movies I had seen with him in it. Amazing🤷🏼‍♀
Loved him in Charlie's angels. First movie I saw him in
Did he say matthew mcconaughey: point break?
He was amazing in Three Billboards
Yes! More Galaxy Quest please!!!
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
I adore Sam since The Green Mile... decades now I love him❤
He is so unbelievably charismatic and charming. His acting is the real deal and he just enjoys every minute of it. That’s why he’s one of my all time fav actors.
Sam is amazing! 🤩 Great actor!
My first introduction was in Galaxy Quest, the whole time I watched the movie I kept thinking "who is this guy'? I found out!  Love him!❤❤❤
this should have been at least a twice as long video...come on
No Jo Jo Rabbit in this list?! I loved him in this
Who?
My boy Sam is absolutely an underrated actor!! Almost already, 1 million views on this video in five days Just saying!
Matthew McConaughey in Point Break that he was not in. Lol I’m so happy that didn’t get cut as a blooper!
No SAFE MEN…? Pffft
I sooo wish his role as charlie in the assassination of jesse james but the coward robert ford had been discussed. He played an unintelligent and "simple" character with such nuance and moments if brilliance. It's one of my favorite roles of his.
He was AMAZING in Three Billboards, and everything he does. One of my favorite actors!
Gentlemen Broncos for me
Moon is such and underrated and overlooked movie. Favorite Rockwell movie.
he was brilliant in Jo Jo rabbit,
His character choice of the self-tanner stained hands for Justin Hammer is one that never fails to delight me
All of that cast seemed to actively love Galaxy Quest. Such a shame that it didn't get the love, it rightly gets, upon release
Zaphod!
I'm surprised The Bad Guys didn't make the list!
If at the end of this video, there's no mention of Box of Moonlight, I'd be totally pissed.....     Aaagh! He forgot about it! How could he have forgotten about it?!? =(
MOON
Came here for The Way Way Back but still enjoyed. Sam is a milder, less dynamic & American version of Gary Oldman, imho.
I wish they'd have mentioned Box of Moonlight. It probably is because it was the first movie I saw him in but I've since found echoes of "The Kid" in each of his characters.
His role as Karl in “The Sitter” was hilarious 😂
I look forward to seeing his Oscar win one day.
"moon" has been a massively underachieving film. It was very well done to effectively hold the entire film himself.
Gentleman Broncos will continue to be one of the most underrated sci-fi comedies of all time. Rockwell is incredible.
This guy is amazeballs! I was enthralled with him since Green Mile.  I am always eager to see what he does next.
Sam Rockwell's performance in Moon was Oscar Worthy.
Hated him in the Green mile… job well done. Great actor
Sam was fantastic in The Winning Season.
Him dancing in Charlie's Angels really awakened something for me personally
The most underrated actor ever
Sam is a Chaos Demon and I'm here for it
SAM ROCKWELL IS ONE OF THE GOATS!!!
OMG a Galaxyquest sequel? Shut up and take my $
I would have a hard time with a galaxy quest 2 with no alan rickman 😢
Galaxy Quest is a 10/10 one of the best movies ever!
I am a fan of Sam Rockwell since Welcome to Collinwood
I would love another Galaxy Quest movie!!! Wouldn't be the same without Alan Rickman though, he was too funny!!
Galaxy Quest limited Series... Bring it on!
He is iconic.  Moon is just a masterpiece, an experience.
Randomly met him on two trips to NYC, once in 2003 (grocery store) and 2014 (we were both watching the same play). Such a nice guy and he’s such a great actor in everything he does!!
He's come a long way since Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
‘Gentlemen Broncos’ was tops
There are movie stars and actors. Sam Rockwell is an Actor.
A Galaxy Quest 2 with Simon Pegg writing would be amazing!
You just can't pick your favourite role of his, every single one is brilliant
Ben Foster and Sam rockwell are the best lesser known massive talent actors
moon is simply a masterpiece
Loved 7 psychopaths
The Charlie’s angels dance always stuck with me.
One of the best actors. Can he play a villain yep. Can he play a hero yep. Can he carry a movie as the only character eg moon yep. I really think his timing is perfect would love to see him in more horrors.
Love this guy! Try gentlemen broncos and F is for Family
The assassination of Jessie James" one of his best roles ever in that film. he's such a top tier actor.
I was so hoping they would include his roles in “The Way Way Back” and “JoJo Rabbit”   TWWB is such a wonderful little movie, totally underrated with a ton of heart, one of my favorites. And my gosh I can’t even watch his performance in JoJo Rabbit and not laugh and cry in the end. Sam Rockwell has an amazing talent for being the irreverent but secretly warmhearted guy, love him!
I heard he'd be Chuck Barris. I grew up on the Gong Show. This kid nailed it!
Love Sam Rockwell. Brilliant in Green Mile. I’d say he’s on a level with Gary Oldman.
JOJO RABIT
No ninja turtles?? Come on now!!
Ok , wow-- SO  many Sam movies I need to see still... ❣️❣️❣️ But seriously - how could anyone do a best roles list and leave out Gentlemen Broncos!!!???? I love him soooo much... 😆
"Is there air!? YOU DON'T KNOW" has to be one of my most favourite line deliveries ever.
Sam would've been a better Tony stark.
Regular or menthol... iykyk
Leaving Gentlemen Broncos and Choke off this list is just an affront to all things cinema.
I haven’t seen a second of this video: “The Way Way Back” better be on here
In my opinion, his greatest role was the assassination of Jesse James by the coward, Robert Ford… it’s a tragedy that they didn’t even mention that movie in the specific video
I know that clown house and TMNT weren't his most popular but I would like to pick his brain about if he ever saw how weird Victor salve was and that TMNT movie which was a very small part but I think that really got him out there
Most underrated actor ever. Love this guy. seen everything he has been in, since Lawn Dogs.
No jojo rabbit?
He needs to be back in the mcu
We got you the bird! Yeah! The bird!
Every time you see Sam in a film. You cannot wait to see what he is going to do. One of the few who can surprise you everytime. Not much on Hollywood anymore. I do like Sam. " I just wanted me some cornbread"
His performance in the way way back was one of his greatest
I'm not seeing it. I'm not seeing results.
Where was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
First movie I saw him in was Lawn Dogs, he was hot in that and he did a great job!
Green Mile
Box of Moonlight as The Kid.  Underrated classic.
"Moon" is great, and i think he is the only one in it.
Sam is awesome and love how he always tries to get some dancing in :)
I know someone who has had to deal with a load of celebs as part of their job and they said Mr Rockwell was the nicest of them all.
Wish they would’ve done Matchstick men
No mention of "Welcome to Collinwood", what's the deal?
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is one of the most underrated movies ever!
His role in teenage mutant ninja turtles was Oscar worthy
No Matchstick Men :(
Paul Giamatti is one of the best actors working today
❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
Safe Men 1998 is another great role.
I can't believe that Jojo Rabbit isn't on this list. He humanised a character who could have easily been a one note joke.
Moon is an unbelievable performance
Box of moonlight!   one of his best
Matchstick men
They should have included Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 😂 jokes aside a really great actor, he can be hilarious and heartbreaking
I loved Sam most as Justin Hammer, and really hope he returns to the MCU in future projects
Argyle was a cool movie I don’t think it should get the hate it’s getting
Sam Rockwell looks like he can play Charlie’s brother in Always Sunny
Sam is so amazing
Seven Psychopaths is one of my favorite SW roles.
Lawn Dogs
Matthew McConaughey... Point break?
*VIDEO REQUEST* - Ian Somerhalder breaks down his most iconic roles.
Love him in all of his movies. Sorry to not hear his thoughts about his early film with John Turturro, Box of Moonlight. Great movie!
I agree with Mr. Rockwell: make Galaxy Quest II happen.
I haven’t even watched this clip. But what I will say, is that Welcome To Collingwood, is one of the most underrated comedies ever
13:50  How could they skip [or edit] how it was to play a character with TWO heads, and THREE arms, with Zaphod Beeblebrox??!!   Sam Rockwell... I've long said, he's the American Gary Oldman, or could play Gary's younger brother.   *Both are among the FINEST actors working the past 20+ yrs.*
Did being in Galaxy Quest F him out of ever being able to be on Trek? I hope not.
3 Billboards 🔥
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
in bruges ??
Legendary actor
Hidden gem film he’s in called The Way way back. Great movie
"argylle", not "argyle". you missed an "L".
No jo jo rabbit he was great in that
I'm sorry, WHERE IS JOJO RABBIT??!!!
Love Sam in ANYTHING
Surprised to not hear about his roles in Richard Jewel and Matchstick Men.
TMNT was the first time I saw him, even for a throw away part, he was memorable.
No matchstick men?
Seven Psychopaths is one of the most underrated movies of the 2010's
I can't believe they didn't ask him about Matchstick Men. That's criminal!
3 days this almost had 1 million views. Rockwell forever.
I prlly like the moon one the best with the clones.
Sams dance moves are unforgettable 💀💀💀
I'm not even 12 seconds into this vid and already want to fast-forward to his performance in The Green Mile. Literally everyone in that film deserves recognition but Sam's performance will always be in my top 10.  Let's also not forget his noteworthy SNL skits: "ATM" and "Genetics Lab".
Wait...what? I need them to make the sequel to Galaxy Quest!!!
Sam Rockwell was just flat out iconic in everything he’s ever done.
One of my favorite actors next to Steve Buscemi.
Matchstick Men .  Amazing actors. Amazing roles. They each gave 100%.
At the end there he mentions Winning Season and Snow Angels -- IMMEDIATELT ADDED THEM TO MY WATCHLIST! 🥹
Very underrated actor
BOX OF MOONLIGHT!!
No love for GENTLEMEN BRONCOS ???  F A I L
"Harmless like Bill Gates" 😂😂😂
The Green Mile, every one was an iconic role. So amazing
My favourite Hollywood actor
sam rockwell needs to be steve jobs. its been my fan casting since he died.
Galaxy quest 2 YES PLEASE
Great actor. Boring interviewee.
Not many actors can do hitchhiker and galaxy quest.
I mean genuinely one of the best actors ever .
He plays a great part in Jojo Rabbit…just a great actor full stop
Never a mediocre moment, one of the bests, if not THE best of his generation. Plus he seems like a cool guy to grab a beer with.👑
Oh, no Heist? I love him in that.
Green Mile is the most faithful to the book film I've ever seen. Great job as Wild Bill
Where's HEIST??? Great actor!
I love him in seven psychopaths ,class
LEGEND
Box of Moonlight.
Are you seriously telling me the journalist didn't ask about "The Assassination of Jesse James" , that performance, in a masterpiece of a movie, was unforgettable.
What was with the “orange” hands? Bad fake tan?
He certainly convinced me in Moon
That's too bad that his role as Captain K in Jojo Rabbit is not discussed too.
Come on GQ, that video ended a little too unceremoniously; Sam was in the middle of speaking about films he was proud of that didn't gain traction and you cut him off??
One of my absolute favorite roles? Water park manager Owen in "The Way Way Back". Totally underrated film!
Our universe President Beeblebrox!
Can't believe he didnt take the opportunity when describing Zaphod to say, "he's just this guy, you know."
I loved him in The way way back
I met Sam in the lobby of his condo building on Boston common. Actually I think it was his girlfriend's place. I guess I didn't really meet him either. I was working on the intercom, and he said hello as he was walking by. It just shows you the kind of guy he is, to take the time to say hello to somebody who most people would consider part of the background.
Hitchikers guide is one of my fav movies. 😅
So super rich people just love lunch. Go to lunch in Hollywood. Go to lunch and write a scene for yourself and you can be a millionare.  It's so easy, I don't understand why everyone isn't rich?
First saw him in Heist with Gene Hackman.  His character, Jimmy Silk was superb... outstanding actor...🤔🤔
Hot 🔥 hot 🔥
One of my absolute favourite screen actors. ALWAYS gives 100% and ALWAYS shines in the role.
I wish you could have covered the way way back that's one of my favorite movies with him.
galaxy quest was my gateway drug to my Sam Rockwell addiction.
Sam is my favorite actor! ♥️
I always forget that the terrible Hitchhikers exists.
Sure enough they missed one of his best movies, Box of Moonlight (1996)
Matchstick Men!?!?! What?
The first movie I ever seen him in was TMNT 1990
Kinda disappointed there was no mention of Gentlemen Broncos
Dude he's the guy in Charlie's Angels, I had such a crush on him playing the bad boy
Ear wig? I knew these actors were cheating 😂
No love for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
They forgot the Ninja Turtles!!!
best movie ever
1990 ninja turtles is when I first saw Sam and have been a fan since
No talk about Jojo Rabbit?
No 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford'? Pfffft!
I wish they discussed "The Way Way Back", it was such a great movie and Sam did an amazing job in that film, definitely one of my favorites!!!
The Way Way Back, Richard Jewell,  & TMNT are the best ones, and you don't have them.
Absolutely a galaxy quest 2 baby yeah! Do it as a doctor who thing as well
No mention of TMNT? Boo!
Matchstick Men & Jojo Rabbit are two more great performances. 👏
I hear his name and I'll watch the movie.
Confessions of a Dangerous Mind    is Fantastic  sooo is Box of Moonlight !!                                  🌙
Nobody gonna talk about that arm tremor we just witnessed near the beginning of the video…
Why isn't Welcome to Collinwood on his list?
Nothing for his role in Richard Jewell?  He was such a big part of that one.
I really hoped they would include Jojo Rabbit.
I KNOW THIS WON'T MATTER MOST LIKELY AND I'M IN ALL CAPS, SOME KIND OF GALAXY QUEST SOMETHING OK !
Yes please! Galaxy Quest 2 or a series? How about both!!!! Yes, yes, yes!!!!
I FULLY ENDORSE the idea of Simon Pegg being involved in a Galaxy Quest sequel.
Sam is in my top 5 actor of all time. with Cillian Murphy, Robert D Jr,  Jeff Bridges, Jim Carrey
One of my all time fav actors. MOON ❤
Do a re-make of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension please
Choke!
Was looking forward to The Way Way Back.  Oh well.
Assassination Jesse James he was great in it! ( He and Casey Affleck)
Where's JOJO RABBIT???!!
I'm like two seconds in and he needs a shave.
I was absolutely astonished when I realized that the same actor who'd played the semi-idiotic guy in "Galaxy Quest" also portrayed Richard Jewell's lawyer.  This actor's scope is phenomenal.
actor's actor
I fancy my range in singing to Sam's range. I always feel like I'm acting, or "channeling" when I do cover songs, and sometimes the original artist comes through perfectly, and still maintains a balanced sense of myself. Sometimes, I just like to go overboard though, like the Korn version of Another Brick In The Wall, that I just did. Check me out, if you like music, and feel led. 🤘😎✌️
Great actor and the nicest guy !!!!!
My favourite actor, think On the way, way back deserves a mention.
Thank you so much for this it was wonderful. Big, Big Fan of Sam; Never saw one of his movies I did not Total enjoy. But I have to say I think the Green Mile was one of his Best, you could not help loving to hate his character, our was it hating to love.
Love Sam Rockwell, but, IMO, a few of these are completely forgettable roles - disappointed to see Jojo Rabbit not included.
Moon is incredible! And what a range...  One of the best actors out there!
Sam Rockwell is THE Wildcard.
Christ, he really is one of the best working actors todays. I forgot all about Moon
GQ are the worst when they ask questions. Stop just STOP
I wish he would have covered about the Way, Way Back!
Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is one of my favorite performances by Sam Rockwell. Movie was painfully underrated.
Owen in The Way Way Back is one of my favorite Sam Rockwell roles.
He gave an Oscar-worthy performance in Seven Psychopaths, so underrated - truly one of the greatest actors with such amazing range, makes every film he's  in that much better!
Did I miss Matchstick Men?..great flick
never seen a movie where he is in it and he isnt captivating in his performance. amazing actor one of my fav of all time
Billy in Seven Psychopaths is an all time great character
Box of Moonlight was the first time I saw Rockwell. Instant superstar! Moon (odd, Moonlight and Moon) is another gem.  Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. That makes me really wonder if it's all true about Chuck Barris.
We need a sequel to Galaxy Quest
A top notch actor can fit into any role he plays, always makes an impact lead or support
If anyone wants to see a great but unknown film starring Sam at his most charismatic check out The Way Way Back. Fantastic coming of age film and Steve Carell plays the “bad guy” so well you’ll hate him by the end.
Personally,  i put Sam Rockwell up there with Gary Oldman when it comes to chameleon type actors that just disappear into the character that they are playing.   They are both A-list actors that sometimes don't get the recognition they deserve because sometimes they become unrecognizable in the roles they take on.
My favorite actor of all time and has one of the most criminally underrated resumes in the business. Do yourselves a favor and just binge his filmography. Especially his lesser known indie films. He can do it all.
Loved him in JoJo Rabbit. Great actor.
Seven psychopaths is a solid watch. Moon was type amazing
A great actor!! Great in Vice and The Green Mile; those are my most favorite. It seems that Sam 'plays well with others.' I like his characters.
“Menthol or regular?” Sam rockwells most iconic role
Loved a lot of movies Sam was in, but I think my favorite was Galaxy Quest...
I get the feeling that whenever an actor talks about their role in a movie with Christopher Walken in it, they talk more about Chris than themselves.  And I absolutely understand that.
The way way back was the best thing hes ever made. to make a comedy have so much meaning takes real talent.
He's defined by the Zaphod character, none of the other roles mattered. Deal with it :)
His best character BY FAR is Zephod Beeblebrox.
He didn’t talk about Bronco/Broncanus!?
Moon is personal favorite of mine
NO NINJA TURTLES?!?!
What about The Way Way Back or JoJo Rabbit?
Jojo Rabbit🫶
No Safe Men? A highly underrated, endlessly quotable, and hilarious movie. Sam Rockwell and Steve Zahn (and Paul Giamatti) delivered in this one.
Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is one of the best movies ever made.
What about ninja turtles?
Love Sam Rockwell! His character in Seven Psychopaths is one of my favorites of all time! My brother and I are even getting matching Jack O’ Diamonds tattoos ❤
I love how Sam made Hammer into the biggest weasel he could. Hems & haws about everything and thinks he's funny. Just a great character.
A very humble guy. I loved him in all the movies I've seen him in. Especially Galaxy quest😊
Where is Jojo Rabbit?
I wish Safe Men got more attention! So many great actors and familiar faces. Sam Rockwell really is a journeyman thru the world of acting.
I remember watching Box of Moonlight for John Turturro and being wowed by Catherine Keener and Sam Rockwell. He had an energy that was palpable and I followed his movies since. I always enjoy his performances.
First saw him in Charlies Angles, and his dancing and smoking in that movie has always stuck with me
The Way Way Back is one of my FAV Sam flicks.  A great performance!
Moon is an absolutely perfect film.
No JoJo Rabbit?? I loved him in that!
I wanted to hear about that Chuck palanuik movie he did where he was an addict
I love Galaxy quest😊
Wait... What about his appearance on Ninja Turtles???
No talk about TMNT?
Moon is one of the most underrated films of all time, and Sam Rockwell is a genius in it. He's one of our all-time favorite actors.
He is a cool dude....
It's not that he's so much underrated, but I feel like he's just not known and appreciated as much as he should be. Sam Rockwell is really something.  Only he could play some of the roles he was given: Galaxy Quest, certainly Moon. Justin Hammer - the list goes on. Rockwell is the GOAT.
He is literally why I started dancing , my style is based off Rockwell
Box Full of Moonlight!!!!
They forgot Jono rabbit 🐰 absolutely great movie & great role for Sam 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Watching this reminded me how much I love Sam Rockwell and what a terrific actor he is.
Anyone remember his HBO special about drinking and driving and he had to pay $1 to the victims family every month?
4:36 My favorite!
Seven Psychopaths is my favourite film of all time. Absolute class
No Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles????
He's hilarious in 7 psychopaths, I love how he just always hates his best friends girlfriend.. " then Ann gets mowed down" 😂
👍👍
He's one of my favourite actors, ever since Lawn Dogs ❤
Where is his performance in JoJo Rabbit??
Keaton in night shift. Lol. I'd love to just talk movies with him
Sam as WILD BILL imo was his greatest performance as an actor.
Thank you. One of my favorites. Rock Ingersol pointing the fire guns and the grin is my lockscreen. Dance more in your films!!
What about Matchstick Men? That was a great film!
He is always a reason for me to watch a movie.
ABSOLUTELY one of the greatest. Fact
I can't decide wether that shirt is awesome or just a drape rip-off ?
My favorite was about a box of moon shine.
Not an iconic character by any stretch, but I went out of my way to see See How They Run precisely because of Sam Rockwell
Slipping in a section on Argyle? Really? Ain't nobody calling that film iconic for any aspect and they never will so just be honest and mark it as the paid promotion/ad aspect of the video.
Sam was so absolutely disarming in Charlie’s angels, he took an absolutely average role and elevated it to something masterful!
No Lawn Dogs?
Clownhouse
Love him ❤
Mmmm...guy.
Celebrities have two modes when it comes to fashion. Zoolander Cosplay and Turbo Hobo. No in-between.
The first movie I saw him in was Box of Moonlight with John Turturro. Still one of my favorite films. Would have loved to have heard his recollections on playing the "kid."
No the way way back?! that is my favorite movie with him
One of my all-time favorite actors! I always get excited when I see his name is mentioned for the cast!
MOON , is way underrated
An American treasure for sure this guy, one of my favourite actors so humble with so much talent and charisma. Awesome artist.
Moon was amazing!!!!!!
I first saw Sam Rockwell in Charlies Angels and was like woah.  I've never disliked anything he's done.
He did, in fact, do a lot of cool movies. Man's not wrong.
Choke? lol
What about Robert Ford? He shared the screen with Brad Pitt?! Who is creating these videos.
Match stick men w Nicholas cage was great
No 'Matchstick Men'? That movie is where he made his bones.
Amazing actor and someone a would like to have as a friend. Just seems like I would always have a smile on around him!
I've been a fan of Sam's since I saw Box of Moonlight when it came out. Watching his career grow and his personality remain true, has been such a gift and pleasure to experience. For my part, he has yet to disappoint. ❤️🎬
SAFE MEN
Would love to have heard him talk about Box of Moonlight.
What about teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
“Regular or Menthol?”🚬
🎶 BAR-BE-QUEEEE! ME AND YOUU! STINKY PINKY PEW PEW PEW 🎶
Go back and watch the original teenage mutant ninja turtles movie, a young sam Rockwell is the only member of the foot clan whom has speaking lines. In like three or four scenes i think? It's a trip
Wish they had done Safe Men.
Sam is amazing in Matchstick Men. Wish they would've touched on that one.
No Best of Enemies?
Best actor of his generation hands down! Like Gary Oldman was the generation before him. Moon is one of my favorite films ever but he’s legit great in everything! Thanks Sam!
Love Sam! Humble and such a great actor
The Green Mile. He stole the show in that movie 👌🏼
Better living through chemistry!
Sam Rockwell is on my top 5 actors of all time. Guy steals every scene he’s in. Very gifted.
Lest we forget. Confessions of a dangerous mind. Wow.
Okay so… Sam Rockwell for Micah Bell when they inevitably make a Red Dead Redemption movie.
I CAN'T believe that you didn't use The Way, Way, Back. Shameful.
No Jojo Rabbit???? Why is no one talking about this!?
There is no tier higher than Sam Rockwell.
Matchstick Men
Love this guy
He really wants to be your friend carl
First movie I saw with Sam was Charlies Angels, and I've been a fan ever since.
I will watch this guy in anything even charlies angels
I've had this opinion for over a decade. Sam Rockwell is the most underrated actor of the 21st century. He is incredible and you just never hear about him for some reason. I don't get it but I assume it's just because he keeps a low profile compared to other people. I've been a fan since Moon which is ironically also an incredibly underrated movie. Dude has range.   If you haven't seen Seven Psychopaths, do yourself a favor and watch it, it's not like anything else out there. Sam Rockwell's incredible in that movie, cracked me up and made me cry all at once.
'The Way Way Back' look it up, I'll wait.
This dude's drug dealer character in The Sitter is straight up hilarious, he made the whole movie
Gentlemen Broncos tho :D
What about this part of TMNT. Menthol or regular scene  Iconic
Moon, by far one of his best films
He’s fantastic. I enjoy him in everything I see him in. He makes every movie better for being in it.
this guys chilled as
Galaxy quest, TMNT, green mile and seven psychopaths 💪🏽🙏🏼🤘🤣
I love Sam in everything I’ve seen him in he does not disappoint. He was also in TMNT ‘90 he had a small role but was very young.
I love this actor. So talented.
His character is always the same though, sam rockwell.   Sam rockwell wearing a space suit, sam rockwell in a business suit.  It just sam rockwell over and over
Possibly the most underrated living actor.
Leslie Nielsen said the reason why the characters he plays are so funny is because he plays them as if there is no joke. Sam Rockwell said the same thing essentially at 9:30 its not funny if its not real. Buying that the character thinks its really happening is very hard for the actor yet absurd  for the audience and therefore hilarious.
Sam Rockwell is a legit legend. Maybe even on the Gary Coleman level.
America's greatest living male actor.
He has aged so well. Doesn't look much older than he did 25 years ago.
No matter what, Galaxy Quest will always come to mind first.
It’s a crime that Lawn Dogs isn’t on this list.
freaking love Moon. one of my favorites. glad it was saved.
Zaphod Beeblebrox
Sad my favorite movie of his is missing. The Way Way Back is just such a beautiful movie
LOVE this guy in that movie where he plays that dumb white guy.
Great actor AND person
Great actor
you forgot gentlemen broncos
...and he was also in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Always has been Criminally underrated.
I wonder does he talk about being in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the original film here?
We need an Oscar bait film with Rockwell and Tucci….NOW
I'll watch anything Sam is in. His acting range is practically unmatched. He was born to act.
This guy is my favorite actor since Abe Vigoda.
Daniel Day Lewis, Gary Oldman, Christian Bale, Christopher Walken and Sam
Sam can smell a cache of yeast cakes 40 mile off
They forgot about the pizza delivery guy in the Stella skit.
The Way Way Back is a major omission here
I absolutely love this actor. Sam Rockwell and  Gary Oldman are my favourite actors and I do not think that will ever change.
One of the BEST actors ever, I would say that he is even GREATER than Cage way more charisma than Cage. His role on Three Billboards is fantastic, his role on Moon is superb. I mean fantastic actor.
No Choke?  okay, bye.
Moon is such an incredible movie that not enough people know about
One of my fav actors. So versatile, a chameleon
The movie I liked that Sam Rockwell was in that was not on the list...Matchstick Men, Great acting! Then Wild Bill in Green Mile!
Fantastic actor, one of my favourite roles of his was in JoJo Rabbit, along with See how they Run
What about the way way back?
Where is Wolf? I know he's an animated character but come on! Also, I loved Argylle. It's over-the-top, outrageous, with incredibly clever twists, the best spy movie I've ever seen (after Casino Royale and Skyfall, of course).
Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy!!! He was Spectacular 😂🎉
My partner ???? You mean your wife
A Simon Pegg Galaxy Quest project?!?!? I am all over that like gravy on a roast dinner.
The Way Way Back?
I think we can all agree that his most iconic role was in "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles:The Movie".
He is too cool.
Never forget he was in Ninja Turtles wh8ch I didn't realize till recently
Sam for me is so underrated despite delivering absolute magics every time he has graced the screen😊
I was really hoping to hear him talk about his role in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in 1990!
No CRAZY CARL 😭 Loved the movie The Sitter!
Moon is one of my favorites. Not a joke, seen it over 100 times 😂
He said Matthew McConaughey in Point Break. He wasn't in Point Break. And it seems nobody in the comments noticed either?
I skipped straight to The Green Mile.
Not one mention of him in Gentlemen Broncos.
Thanks for all the great performances, Sam! One of the very best.
How could they leave out Gentlmen Broncos!!??
Great actor.
Wish they'd mentioned Gentlemen Broncos, such a ridiculous film
Love him in Safe Men
When they say underrated...respond with the phrase "Sam Rockwell".
love you sam but Iconic? seriously?
the word ICONIC is used way too much by retards to describe something they actually know very little about
can't hate this guy
Every time I watch Sam Rockwell, I am struck by his elegant acting ...absolutely love him !
One of my all time favorites, Sam, if I find out a movie that’s coming out has him in it I try to watch it.
I just went and saw Argyle. People say it has too many surprises and its hard to follow but its really well done every twist and turn is there for a reason and fits. And his character is super smooth.
Hey, it's Guy!
This Men does not get the publicity he deserves. He is by far one of the best actors in our generation. His talent to look and act different in almost every single role is mindblowing.
Sam should have won an Oscar for Moon. I don’t think I’ll ever get over it.
Moon was just brilliant!
His role as Charley Ford in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford was excellent too. This needs to be a part one of two episodes at least.
Choke is underrated
Was hoping Jojo Rabbit was on the list, he was incredible in that one
Sam Rockwell as Chuck Barris is one of the most memorable performances I've seen. The whole premise of that movie still fascinates me to this day. 🎉🎉🎉
What about  " The Way Way back "?
Don Verdean is way too underrated. I love that movie and no one talks about it.
One of those guys who elevates a movie by just showing up
I am so sad Jojo Rabbit isn't in here.
I can't think of a single character that Sam has done that that didn't make the scene markedly better
One of my all time favourite actors! In the film "The way way back", he showed his softer side but with a huge dollop of comedy. Wild Bill = iconic role. As a side note, Sigourney Weaver in Galaxy Quest looked absolutely stunning, blonde hair really suits her.
They have Sam signed on for a Galaxy Quest sequel with Simon Pegg offering to help. What are they waiting for?
Moon is amazing.  Watch it.
I was just saying to my girlfriend that Sam Rockwell is one of my top 3 favorite actors, and then this comes up on YouTube
Moon didn't go under the radar. Moon was an instant sci-fi classic.
He didn't talk about a couple of my favorite movies, Lawn Dogs and Box of Moonlight.
M O O N Nuff said.
People show up for George...I would too if he gave me a million $!!!
Snow Angels gets a mention! Underrated masterclass all around. 🎥
I cannot believe Lawn Dogs is not here.
Moon is one of my favorite movies.
what about TMNT?!?
Loved his character in Jojo Rabbit but I guess it was too small a part to make the list. Loved Moon though, very underrated movie.
Moon is a 10.
I can’t believe they didn’t take about his most famous role… as that one guy in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the Movie.
great guy, very personable. met him at the airport while we were waiting for our flight. we chatted a little about everything. he was very kind and appreciative when i gushed about a few of his roles.
It's criminal to not feature The Assassination of Jesse James in this video, he was magnificent in that film
Ever since the green mile. I been a huge Sam Rockwell fan. Even great in way way back. That took some acting to do. lol.
No mention off Gentlemans Bronco. Shame
Box of moonlight was the first movie of his I watched and it still remains one of my favorites.
The movie is called "Argylle"
Billy Green mile and chuck barris 💯🔥
Loved him in Jojo rabbit
Underappreciated talent  Great interview
"..harmless, like Bill Gates"
I am not going to lie. I always forget to remember him. He is one of those guys that just lays low but once he is out and showing his skills, he is absolutely amazing. He is hilarious and can bedramatic. There are many who are said to be underrated but he has to be one of those who has been in hollywood for a long time that seriously never disappoints in whatever role he is in. Salute to Sam Rockwell.
Captain K woooo!
wished he would've said something on Capt. K
I absolutely love!!!!! Sam Rockwell! He’s an excellent actor!!
The Way Way Back
I’d love it if Sam Rockwell returns as Justin Hammer in the MCU someday. He’s an underrated villain
I'll just say, I'm upset and disappointed his role in the 1990s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie wasn't featured in this interview.
Sam is great and doesn't get appreciated enough. I've never seen him bad in anything.
Sam is such an incredible actor, a bit underrated imho but he's great.
love this guy! C'mon Allright
Not including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a travesty.
this guy is the best actor of our time
When are you gonna have James woods?
There is nothing wrong and bad with just having one women writer
maybe not an iconic role but i remember him in the 1990 TMNT movie
Loved him in tmnt 1990
The first movie I remember watching with Sam Rockwell was the guinea pig spy film G-Force. My favorite role of his would without a doubt have to be Wild Bill (however I will say Justin Hammer’s a close second).
Jojo rabbit 👍
I see Sam,I click Sam Rocks Well
Sorry, 17 Minutes is not enough.... will there be a Part 2?
I’d love to see Sam as the lead actor to Tarantino’s next movie. I hear it will be Brad Pitt tho.. I love Pitt too but I’ve already seen him in 2 of his movies.
I was hoping he would talk about TMNT
What about TMNT? Lol
Jojo rabbit
Dang. I dunno how they came up with this list, but understanding that he isnt really marketed well as a title billing actor, I can see why I missed half the movies in this list. But I do think he is great in every role i have seen him in
Love Sam in everything hes in. I thought he did great in Argyle.
You do his iconic characters but forget The Way Way Back 😢
A heck of an actor!  The shirt is badass…
Please don't take this wrong but Justin Hammer gave me serious Gary Oldman vibes and I loved it. Loved the character, he felt to me like if Tony Stark and Gary Oldman had their DNA combined to produce an offspring he would be Justin Hammer.
Moon was excellent!!!
These vids are awesome
Love Sam Rockwell, I was lucky enough to meet him in New York few years ago, he was so welcoming and down to earth.
Galaxy Quest was perfect, everyone was perfect. You never get that. Sam's acting was extremely believable.
I love Sam. He pretty much steals every scene he's in. Wonderful actor.
No Gentlemen Broncos??? Booooooooooo!!!!
Sam Rockwell is this generation’s Gary Oldman. Amazing character actor who can do anything at all.
"We might do another Martin McDonaugh movie" YO
I love Sam Rockwell that’s all ❤
Billy blaze jowski as inspiration? First time I heard that, that's awesome
Was hoping he'd mention Gentlemen Broncos. If you know, you know.
Confessions is my all time favorite movie.
I always liked this dude, seems like a legit dude
We need a pt. 2 with Matchstick Men, Box of Moonlight, and The Way Way Back
WHAT?! No Gentlemen Broncos???
Box of Moonlight!
Wait, he wasn't in Band of Brothers?
Annoying that the list didn't include Frost/Nixon, The Assassination of Jesse James or Conviction.
After Moon, his absolute best role is in The Way Way Back.  No one else could have played that role.  Sad it wasn't featured in this.
Galaxy Quest series?! Yes, please
I love his dancing.
Ummm... TMNT gave us Sam. Wtf
How do you leave out Assassination of Jesse James? I think that was his best performance ever!
Winning season and snow angels are next on my watchlist
Argyle is not iconic. 😂
"There were about 18 writers and only one of them was a woman...in a film about women." ❤❤
I miss Justin Hammer ❤ and i need him again
Please, please, please make that Galaxy Quest series happen! That would be amazing. RIP Alan Rickman, by Grabthar’s hammer you shall be avenged!
It's about time!!!
This guy.... this guy... i mean who doesn't love Sam Rockwell? First i really "saw" him was watching Matchstick Men with Nick Cage. He has an uncanny ability at seeming like the "every guy" yet when he's on screen you're just drawn to him.
Shoulda talked about TMNT 😂
Greatest underrated actor of all time
Sam Rockwell he is def a g
Can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe!? I still use that line.
I saw Argylle Sunday and Sam was AMAZING in it! He has always been on of my favorite actors and it's great to see him in roles like that. He's not done yet!
Always fun to see Sam Rockwell. Great actor.
Sam rockwell...legend
Too bad they couldn't squeeze in Snow Angels, but I'm glad he mentioned it at the end. I saw it about a year ago, and it's absolutely devastating. One of his best, but not widely known.
Fosse/Verdon is incredible. I love Sam, any time he’s in a project I get excited for it.
Sam R , fantastic actor !
Love Sam Rockwell. Really wish y’all had included Midsummer Night’s Dream and (just for fun) the 1990 Ninja Turtles flick.
Such a great actor but I think he should b in an epic before his day, I'm talking to u, quentin and scorcese. But he has such a great resume, I'm gunna watch moon such an underatted film.
The Way Way Back doesn’t get a mention?!
Too bad the 3 Billboards thing was basedon a lie.
We can say Iconic!!!!
I like him great actor cool, and nice guy, no mention of jojo rabbit
C'mon fuckstick
Moon is so underrated.
Great guy, huge fan😊
No JoJo Rabbit.... WTF?
"Moon" is one of my favorite films.  Absolutely fantastic.
No Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990)?! That's what I was hoping for the most.
I saw Box of Moonlight when it came out in 1996 then Lawn Dogs in 1997. They may not be considered “iconic roles” but remain two of my favorite quirky movies.
There are no degrees of iconic.
Rockwell was the best part about Ironman 2.
Sam Rockwell - Most Iconic Roles - No Gentlemen Broncos? wtf lol
No mention of JoJo rabbit?
Probably one of my favorite living actors.
I forgot how many great role Rockwell had done.
Matchstick Men is such an underappreciated film, I wish he could have discussed it too.
Why not include his role in The Assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert Ford?
Im so happy he got the role of Zaphod instead of Will Ferrel or Jim Carrey. He was my favourite thing in that movie ✨
Moon is one of my favorite movies of all time I'm glad to see it make this list.
🎶 Barbecue, Me & You! 🎶
How did he miss talking about Jojo Rabbit?
Gentleman Broncos!!!!!!!!!
What’s up nick
Safe Men   Welcome to Colinwood
Not sure
I was hoping he'd talk about "Matchstick Men".
Why is Jojo Rabbit not included? Literally his best movie.
This guy is amazing! Loved him in 7 psychopaths
One of the most versatile actors you will ever watch. I would compare him with the likes of Gary Oldman.
I can't believe they didn't included The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and no one mentions it in the comments. He was so great in that film!
How can you not talk about JoJoRabbit?
I WANT A GALAXY QUEST SERIES!!!!!  Cmon Simon Pegg get on it.  I need something to replace Orville.
He's a singular actor with whom I think I could legit be friends.  He seems so down to earth and not lost in Hollywood.
Galaxy Quest sequel or limited series? Get on it Simon Pegg!!!
I can't believe they skipped Gentlemen Broncos!
coolest. cat. ever
Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind
For Justin Hammer being written into the script on the fly the character is quite memorable in the end! 👍
MOON and Matchstick Men are two of his most over looked roles, IMO.  I absolutely LOVE this guy.
"What's a cow?' - Zaphod Beeblebrox
Nothing irks me more than the fact that they dont do these in chronological order. IF u did, I feel like the people interviewed would better be able to communicate the growth in their roles/careers or the antithesis. Jumping around does nothing but destroy any sort of congruity for the viewer. What is the fluffing point of jumping around?!?!?!?!? AHHHHH
Moon is so underrated.
Bro Matchstick Men! One of the best movies ever!
No JoJo Rabbit??? That's the one I a slooking forward to :(
Truly a great actor
LOVE this guy. Brilliant actor. Such a shame only one out of him and Woody Harrelson could win that Best Supporting Actor for Three Billboards.
Teenage mutant ninja turtles ?? No shout out? Oh well
"Go to the corner of Eastman and Laird. You get your answers there"
Always loved Rockwell, he's a character in and of himself, let alone the rolls he's played. One of my top five, easy.
So disappointed that Argylle wasn't the action film he deserved. I was so excited for it.
Never seen him bad in any film. Love that he remembers other actors in every role..  "if I have seen further [than others], it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."
Is it me or was Fosse the inspiration for Tom Cruise’s Les Grossman in Tropic Thunder?? 😱
I noticed he didn’t mention Ninja Turtles…
Sam Rockwell is so underrated. I love actors like him. Just real people, and the kind of guy you'd kick back and have a brew with.
I loved his performance in Three Billboards, just amazing. As usual. :)
I was BLOWN AWAY by Sam Rockewell's performance in The Green Mile. Then I payed attention to all of his roles.
What about CLOWNHOUSE?
Loved him in Three Billboards. Really great.
Choke
LOVE Sam Rockwell, a talented, funny actor - Always enjoy any movie he has been in…AND such a great dancer….yes I’m looking at you Charlie’s Angels 😁👍
Why no Best of Enemies or The Way, Way Back?
Sam Rockwell and Bill Murray are two of the greatest character actors of our time.
His character in The Green Mile is pure walking talking chaos.
Galaxy Quest will always be my favourite film of his by far.
Love Sam
I love how much prep he does. A professional
I’ll happily watch a movie just because it has Sam Rockwell in it.
Really? Really? No one ever talks about The Search for One Eye Jimmy. EVER!!! Even at the end of this video where he rattles off a few movies he doesn't even mention it and he plays Jimmy!!! It's also a shame Gentlemen Broncos isn't mentioned here. Come on, y'all.
Where's matchstick men??!!!
“Peter Dinklage was there in this little town” lmao
Sam is one of thee greatest.
I was obsessed with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind when it was released... and then the same with Moon.
Sam is seriously mellow in this video... I'm not sure why, but I always thought his real personality would entail joking and smiles... this guy is serious as a heart attack...   that being said tho, I love his characters in movies. some of my favorite ones for sure.
His role and acting in Three Billboards is what really made me fall in love with him.
His few scenes in Gentlemen Broncos were hilarious. I loved that he was cast for that role.
Wanted him to talk about the way way back
I love this guy as an actor
Moon is probably the best movie with only one actor, Cast Away, second best
Such a great actor!!!
Love Sam 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🔥🤛🏻🇬🇧
EASILY his best role was an early one ..in the movie BOX OF MOONLIGHT!   made me a lifetime fan
more///
👍👍
So JoJo Rabbit - 7.8 IMDB - Not one mention.  The Captain is a superb character.
One of the most underrated actors EVER!!
Amazing guys. Haven't seen a bad movie with him in it
Wow, no Fifth Element...
I’d love to go for a pint with Sam Rockwell
I obviously need to see more of his movies.  I didn't know that some of these even existed.
They forgot G Force and The Bad Guys
I would like to see a video where Survivor contestants and fans react to Total Drama and Amazing Race contestants and fans react to Ridonculous Race.
He is perfect in EVERY role he has been in.
They forgot "Safe Men"
Dude hasn't aged a day. That adrenochrome doing wonders for his complexion.
Unbelievable movie catalog
Nothing about Gentlemen Broncos? This is a travesty.
I need one of this of William Petersen.
Dudes of Steel! Let's get the band back together, yeah?  Slosh is going to do one. You in? Jam master shecky
Love Sam Rockwell, top 5 favorite actors for me.
And not a single mention of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990) movie. Sam was the cigarette kid in the warehouse
10:55 harmless like Bill Gates! hahaha
I thought he did a great job playing Chuck Barris.
It's not a movie role but does anyone remember Sam in the episode of the comedy series 'Stella' when he sells the boys fake mustaches? It's hilarious! He plays the part like a paranoid drug dealer 🤣
I'm a simple cineast. I see Sam. I click like
cant believe they didn't include RICHARD JEWELL
I went to rehab once and a young Rockwell was in one of the videos we used to watch on the dangers of addiction. He was solid lol
Guy Fleegman as Security Chief 'Roc' Ingersol  Best Movie Credit EVER
Nobody plays Sam Rockwell quite like Sam Rockwell himself.
'Moon' is a brilliant and heartbreaking film.
what about Lawn Dogs 1997?
We need a part 2 for Sam Rockwell
10:12 don’t tempt us all with that kind of statement ❤️
Sam Rockwell doesn’t get enough credit. He’s always awesome, I especially love him in “The Best of `enemies”.
I loved him in Lawn Dogs. That was such a vulnerable role ❤❤
Love Sam Rockwell, what a talented actor and all of those roles, what a tour de force.  Didn't mention his role on Jojo rabbit which is one of my favourite characters of all time.  ALL TIME.
No TMNT? Come on. They should have started with that. If anything, to show that a small role can be a stepping stone to getting your face out there for the bigger roles.
Sam Rockwell would have made a much better Ford Prefect. He has that louche approach to life in his veins.
No Gentleman Broncos. Easily the oddest character he has ever played. But, given how many interesting roles he has had, no doubt that movie is not the only one other Nerd Rages that will happen in this comment section. Which is why Sam is Iconic, everyone remembers him in every role
GENTLEMEN BRONCOS is his best DUAL ROLE EVER!!!!
Absolutely crushed Argyle…honorable mention Hitchhikers Guide
He was hilarious in The Sitter.
"You can slowly go crazy." *craziest laugh imaginable*
I like how he added two more at the end - shoulda kept the camera rolling! 😊
Box of Moonlight?
Glad to see they saved the best for last, "Moon" is a si-fi Masterpiece in my opinion.
Whoever came up with "Radioactive Tampon" deserves an OSCAR...
I don't care, he steals the show even if he's on the screen for ten seconds.  Highly underrated actor.
Dude moves like a Cat ..Legend
His greatest role by far was in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
First time I saw him was on T.M.N.T. 1990.
the puke crooks took the made service too...
10 seconds of Green Mile, that was disappointing. He played a great role in that.
no jojo rabbit?
I hated Sam Rockwell for so long, when I was younger because of the Green Mile role...but now I just appreciate how great of an actor he is!
No break down of Gentlemen Broncos?
One of my favorite actors
Everyone knows his greatest roll was “One Eyed Jimmy” in The Search For One Eyed Jimmy!!
Have to say I dislike most actors, but Rockwell adds some gravitas to the role of acting that goes unappreciated. Enjoyed pretty much all of his movies.
No love for the punk in the first Ninja Turtles movie?
understand it's not technically a film but no band of brothers?
Surprised to not see 'The Way Way Back' on here
A shame we didn't get to hear him talk about JoJo Rabbit, he hit some strong emotional chords in that movie. Great actor overall!
A shout out for Jimmy Silk! Anybody?
He's one of the greatest!!! Love love Sam Rockwell!!!
What about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
Big fan of Mr. Rockwell and my vote goes to “Box of Moonlight”.
Id love to see something with Sam and Walter Googins playing off one another. They have similar energy and really know how to staddle intensity and humour  with a bit of menacing when need be
GALAXY QUEST MUST RETURN
he looks and feels stoned, like mmmm ok, ill do the video but lets not get too much into it
You guys spelled Argylle wrong.
Captain K!!!
Om Sam tuh buatku sama underrated nya kayak Patrick Wilson. Filmnya dimana2, sering jadi lead role tp kek masi underrated gitu idk
Can tell he does it for the love of movies
Love MOON,  love Sam in everything I have ever watched him in. He is a true talent.
Disappointed that Sam's role as Charley Ford in the The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford didn't get a mention. Phenomenal film.
Everyone is talking about Way Way Back, Matchstick men... But what about Bronco/Brutus?
You missed TMNT.  That needs to be added
How could you not include Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!? ;-) Mr. Rockwell is a GOAT, as the youths say.
I remember seeing "Moon":" This is a great actor, why nobody knows him?".
LOVE Sam Rockwell!! He was one of my celebrity crushes as a teen. And he dances so well. I fell for his dancing, I stayed for his incredible range and acting talent.
I’d love to see him as Deadpool.
What?! what about TMNT!
Shocking they didn’t mention jojo rabbit. Even smaller films like Joshua and Matchstick Men are a must-watch if you’re a Sam Rockwell fan
That laughter after "...you have to stay grounded and be patient, otherwise you can slowly go crazy"  Uhhhh yeahhhh. Sure.
I can't believe they didn't mention his role in The Green Mile 😮
i dont know why i was expecting him to talk about his role in the first ninja turtles movie...but i was really hoping he was going to. xD
Sam Rockwell used to be hot.  Not so much anymore.... maybe he should hook up with Demi's plastic surgeon.
his role in 1990s TMNT is still the most iconic role of his, believe its even his first. "menthal, or regular"
I can certainly say with confidence Sam is iconic.
I was hoping for Richard Jewell, it's a very interesting movie
Quick!!  Sit him down and talk about everything and anything that isn’t Argylle!!
Galaxy Quest is one of my favourite films
One of the greats! One of my favorites!
Bird.
This  guy oozes charisma and charm i wanna be like him .
moon is criminally underrated. i consider it one of my all time favorite sci fi films.
I really enjoyed him in Jojo Rabbit. It is one of my favorite films of all time.
I thought this was the South African actor Neil Sandilands
Fantastic Actor .....one of a kind
Love this guy. He just exudes coolness. Very rad dude.
No Captain K in Jojo Rabbit ??? Mental.
Moon is still one of my favorite films.
He always plays a character that's just "out there". Be it Seven Psychopaths, Jojo Rabbit and many others. Dude knows how to pick a role and then go all in.
Crew Member Guy 😂
Loooooveeee Sam!!!!
No mr.perfect???!?!?
I feel like somehow I've not seen most of Sam's movie, but they all seem amazing.
it's all about box of moonlight.
Yooo Sam needs to play Mick Foley in a wresting movie because he’s got his exact goatee going.
0:24 hmmm. I almost heard "I did her with those guys"... 🤨 I need some sleep
WHAT ABOUT CHOKE!!!!!!
More Sam please.
What a rip. Not a single mention of his Oscar worthy performance in TMNT
I don’t know how his first role , which is ninja turtles, isn’t in jere
No Matchstick Men?
Still amazed that this guy isnt more of a household name. I cant think of a better screen actor of his generation. He lifts and adds so much to everything he's in, in such different but convincing ways.
He also voices vic in f is for family 😂
He's never had an iconic role.
The Way Way Back will always be one of my favorites. Loved the relationship between Owen and Duncan throughout the story.
The Way Way Back? One of my favorite Rockwell films.
Such an underrated actor.
I’ll watch anything with Rockwell in it. Dude is an amazing actor. The fact that he references Keaton in Night Shift makes him that much cooler.
Such an underrated talented guy, i absolutely love him in 7 Psychopaths and 3 Billboards, elevates every movie he is in tenfold
Im' trying to understand what GQ is trying to do here... It seems they want shorter version of this... how about 40-45 mins? It seems the actors talked way more about each role.
Loved him in Seven Psychopaths, n Hitchhikers Guide to The Galaxy
You're inspiring sam!!
Seven Psychopaths is one of my favorites
I know he has a oscar. But i will still say this "This guy is underrated"
Moon pie splat 😂😂😂
He's one of the best character actors of all time and certainly of our generation - I LOVE me some Sam Rockwell! MOON was incredible and loved him in 3 Billboards and how he was able to turn a villain straight by the end of the film. Amazing performances all around! The waterslide movie (the name evades me) was incredibly endearing and he was stellar in Richard Jewell.
Moon remains one of my all time favorite sci-fi films ever.  Would also love a series or another movie based off Galaxy Quest!
Loved your role in Galaxy Quest! 😂
I watched Heist recently he was great as Jimmy Silk
My intro to Sam Rockwell was the first live action TMNT movie. He's one of those actors that could be in anything and when he is, the movie is just better.
One of my favorite actors, I don’t think he gets enough recognition.
TMNT is his best role.
one of the best actors!!💯
I'm disappointed they didn't do Gentlemen Broncos!
No The Way Way Back or Matchstick Men? Pathetic
Do a director's cut with The Way Way Back and Box of Moonlight. Not necessarily iconic but excellent nonetheless.
Perhaps the first actor that had a dozen movies worth to be mentioned in the clip and perhaps another half a dozen that didn't make it. A true testament to the greatness of Sam Rockwell..
No Jojo Rabbit? Sad
Eric Knox is definitely my favorite Rockwell character, I used to watch Charlie's Angels a bunch. I am so down for a Galaxy Quest series.
Effortlessly cool, criminally underrated actor who improves anything he's in. One of my heroes.
How did you not include “Lawn Dogs” with Mischa Barton?!?  That was the Sam Rockwell performance I really wanted to hear about.  :/
The best of enemies was my first time really looking at his acting and I think it's an amazing movie.  Really recommend a watch!
I wish they would have talked about The Sitter. Such a dumb but hilarious movie
He is so very cool
I like this guy. One of his movies i like most is (moon) if you not watch this movie bro you got to see it
Hes my favourite in jojo rabbit
He was amazing in Galaxy Quest. His character was hilarious, soecial. I hope you know how amazing  you are.
Great interview! And Sam is such a versatile actor...love him!
👎
I think Jojo Rabbit was one of his very best
Moon is absolutely incredible and Sam Rockwell owns that movie. Shoutout to Clint Mansell for his incredible score, as always.
its missing one of his best performance in the assassination of jesse james
If there's gonna be a RDR2 movie or series and Peter Blomquist isn't available, I want Sam Rockwell as Micah Bell. 😂
TLDW:  He doesn't talk about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Where is Mr Wright? 😢
He gets so little credit despite being a great actor...
Phillip Seymour Hoffman was the greatest to ever grace us with his effortless gifts, Sam Rockwell is also casting a long intimidating shadow with his career. 👏🏾👍🏾
For at least half those movies - Me: That was HIM!?  Probably says a lot about his skills as an actor.
Sam and Owen Willson should take a pair of roles as brothers.
Stunning actor.
One of my favorites is Gentlemen Broncos. He was so great in that.
He's unbelievable, I can't believe they didn't touch a bit on Richard Jewell.  He was great, and TMNT 1990
I'd love to see a Galaxy Quest 2!!! Not to mention if Simon Pegg is on the project.
As a kid seeing galaxy quest he was a the funniest adult I've ever seen
He made a wonderful film way back,called Lawn Dogs.Went under the radar,a true hidden gem.Truly charismatic actor!
legend
You can’t put argyle in this,it’s too new to be iconic
wtf, no Jojo Rabbit?
Low key GOAT.
Just watched Argylle. Worst movie I’ve ever seen in my entire life. Can’t even describe how bad it was
“Choke” is my favourite Sam Rockwell movie
Sam is one of my favourite actors. Such a chameleon and  you can tell he puts his heart into everything he plays.
If he doesn't dance in it, then it's not really Rockwell
Where has he been?  I need more Sam Rockwell in my life.
One of our best actors.  What a cool dude.
Ninja turtles.
I don't need a sequel to Galaxy Quest, I need the original R rated cut.
I Interviewed Sam for this video; he was so nice and sooooo insightful. Probably one of my favourite videos I've ever done. He had so many great films to talk about that it was impossible to get all of them in the time we had. Can't wait to find out about the new Martin McDonagh film!
Sam is amazing. LOVE him in "moon"💜👍
I’ll go and see any film by default if Sam Rockwell is in it.
I fell in love with this amazing actor off Charlie's Angels. That scene when he's dancing to pharoahe monch, smoking a cigarette, just having fun being evil. He sold me on that scene.
The dance in Charlie’s Angels is iconic 😎
So TMNT?
Winning Season is my favorite Rockwell movie. I’ve watched it over a dozen times
how do you not ask about jojo rabbit....!?
Great actor. Been great if had mentioned Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, first time I remember seeing him
welcome to colinwood is my favorite role of him 😂
No mention of Captain K in JoJo? WTF
For a minute I thought they were going to leave out Zaphod. 😅
Sam's just fantastic.
He was great in Jojo Rabbit
Jo jo rabbit???😮😮
I’m very disappointed that Gentleman Bronco wasn’t included in this list.
Wonderful actor.
My favourite part of his is in Flight Facilities music video Down to Earth
i swear he asks that he has a dance scene iany movie he doed
I came here to see what he said about his role in TMNT (1990) and not even mentioned…
all he said about Zaphod was more or less hes just some guy you know
He's really a cool guy. Does Sam actually dance in all the movies he's in?
people don't really mention his role in "Choke" but he was phenomenal in that movie. Sam Rockwell rules ❤
Funny as that girls high school basketball coach as well. I forget the title.
I like how he kept talking, mentioning movies GQ wasn't interested in spotlighting.
He was in a great move called the way way back. It's a Supriseingly great movie.
I just watched MOON yesterday. What an amazing movie. Watch it.
I think his best in assassination of Jesse James say the coward Robert Ford, its just not many have seen it.
I’m sorry, but you don’t ask Sam Rockwell about THE dance he does in Charlie’s Angels?!?! The F?!
ma maaaa ,, hahahaha  FM makes everybody look bad
Matchstick men
Moon is one of the greatest movies ever made.
How could they not mention "Choke" that movie was amazing.
Seven Psychopaths, when Sam acted circles around Colin Farrell, Woody Harrelson and Christopher Walken in a movie. For me his most iconic role.
Sam Rockwell is an absolute legend. He’s one of those actors that will make me want to watch the movie just because he’s in it.
Where is teenage mutant ninja turtles!?
Sam Rockwell is the GOAT.
A massively underrated actor.
The Way Way Back will always be my favorite of his
I need more❤
Gentlemen Broncos????
No JoJo Rabbit?!?
They should've talked about his role in Gentlemen Broncos. What a missed opportunity.
why Jojo Rabbit's not on the list?
Wish they featured his film Choke.
He's the bee's knees that Sam Rockwell! 🤙🏻🙌🏻
No JoJo Rabbit and his most important role, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1990?!?
Surprised they didn't cover MATCHSTICK MEN. Easily one of his best.
Why isn't Choke on there!!!
Should have been Lawn Dogs
lol I watched like half these movies and could have never said who this dude was, never once heard his name even
Sam! Where's Jojo Rabbit❤️
Galaxy Quest was awesome!!!
What! No Matchstick Men?
I lived his character in The Way Way Back. Kinda sad it wasn’t mentioned.
One of the most underrated actors of his generation
I really wanted to hear him talk about his role in "The Sitter". That movie is so much fun and it feels so weird to see Sam as the bad guy there
He is great in comedy roles
LOVE Sam Rockwell and now even more so about his comment of how Charlie's Angels had like 17 writers but only one was a woman, in a film about women. What a gem.
GQ February 03 issue Sam Rockwell was featured on the cover and what I can only say a very detailed Movie like well written article done about him. You guys ever come across that magazine issue read it!!!
As a lot of people have said here already Sam is one of the greats. Always brings his A-game to every part no matter how big or small. Love him.
This feels criminal to say, but I didnt realise how many great roles Sam Rockwell has had until seeing them listed back to back.
Moon is still one of my favorite movies of all time, the soundtrack too, hnng just slaps
No best of enemies?
Where is Jo Jo Rabbit?
He was awesome in the movies I have seen. Green Mile, 7 Psychos and the Best: Moon!
Was hoping they'd bring up Junk Yard Dawgs with his role as Rod
I love that Sam Rockwell clearly just really loves movies. Not just the ones he's in, just movies in general. Cool dude.
I like his movie references. It’s a nice mix of different things. Not just cinéma d’auteur..
I hope Justin Hammer will return in upcoming Marvel Disney Plus Series
Sam Rockwell is one of those actors. Where I know is going to elevate and make any movie they’re in interesting. Such a great actor
His role in The Way Way Back wasnt included. Not surprised but I wish it had been
My favourite actor no question
I love how honest he is about his influences!
Dude is a beast!
This guy is a shapeshifter <3
i think his performence in jojo rabbit was amazing, couldnt ask for a better captain klenz
No questions about the Ninja Turtles Movie ??
Brilliant character actor
he should've been the only villain in ironman 2... He was so charismatic and funny in the film
nothing for Ninja Turtles???? cmon
What about Choke? Disappointed
I’d completely forgot he was in The Green Mile. And I genuinely don’t mean that in a bad way. I always remember his character in it and what an unlikeable character he was in that film. I think he’s great! One of the best actors around working today. Much respect to him.
no way way back ??
'Choke' is one of my favorites of all time!
Always loved Matchstick Men. Kind of out there reference but
Weird. The Way Way Back is my favourite performance of his!!
Deserved an Oscar for the Green Mile. Has he ever been bad in a movie? I think not.
He will ALWAYS be Zephod to me, I can't under him
Is he wearing that shirt or is the shirt wearing him?
Moon is incredibly underrated. Excellent movie.
Sam Rockwell makes every film better with his performance. Nuff said.
Glory Daze? Hello? Y'all suck
LEGEND
Sam with a beard and long hair looks like Stanley Tucci
People always seem to forget about Welcome to Collinwood, he was hilarious in it.
10:13 WHO DO I NEED TO GIVE ALL MY MONEY TO?! I need a Galaxy Quest series in my life PRONTO!
LOOOOVE BROKAAHs….
Aww they didn't mention the assassination of Jesse James 😔
I thought the movie Moon was absoultely outstanding
Why does he look like he has a wife called "Christinith" who used to date Will Ferrell?
For a Strong Willed Arrogant Bleep he’s still quite humble!!? Which I’m Somewhat Torn about???!!!!
You really forget how many great movies he’s done over a long period of time.
Awesome list, what an actor. To bad there was nothing about band of brothers. Probably because it's not a movie, come to think of it :D
I liked him in that sci-fi flick Moon.
No JoJo Rabbit?
I'm a little upset The Bad Guys isn't on here.
His performance in Green Mile still haunts me to this day and I must have watched it like 20 years ago
Godzilla Dance ❤  Love it. Charlie s Angel 💖
Should have had F is for Family what an outrage!
Weird, I've seen this guy in many movies and never knew who he was, never connected the different roles but enjoyed his part in the movies.
The guy can dance
Moon.... probably my favourite film of all time.... Sam just smashes every scene.Truly amazing actor.
Moon is one of the best Sci-fi movies of the past 20 years - incredible performance.
He didn’t talk about gentleman broncos….that was my back up nad
I’m bummed they didn’t include Matchstick Men. He’s amazing in that.
Everyone's saying they wish he had talked about The Way Way Back, and I love that film, but the film he needed to talk about was The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford
Box of Moonlight is my favorite
He should have had an Oscar for Moon. That movie is in my top 10 and it’s all him.
Nothing on Ninja Turtles 1990?
Jo Jo rabbit not listed here but awesome
fun to hear him mention which specific roles inspired him and guided him like that.
His Galaxy Quest performance was (forgive the pun) outta this world.
Damn...I wanted to see his take on JoJo Rabbit.
If you haven't seen Seven Psychopaths, I highly recommend
aww I came here for his part in Jojo Rabbit
he really said he's around, in aromor wars
My favorite actor! He's amazing in anything he does.
The way way back great movie with him
Sam Rockwell's performance in the green mile was so impressing!!
Love this guy
*MOON* ♥😍♥🥰♥😍♥
Watching him and Frances MacDorman going toe to toe in Three Billboards is one of life's great pleasures. Both were clearly at the top of their game.
Loved him in JoJo Rabbit
He was awesome as Charlie Ford too.
Sam Rockwell blurs the line between character actor and star so well that he's both in more movies than you realize but not as popular as you think.
Dang I wish he talked about his role on the TMNT movie
A few more movies I need to check out. A few that weren't mentioned: way way back, matchstick men, JoJo rabbit, conviction.
Sam is like BASF, he literally makes everything better. The dudes acting ability is so fuggin perfect. I love him in everything he has done.
It’s pretty funny this video being uploaded now because just last week I showed my buddy Seven Psychopaths which he loved and then he suggested we watch Moon next haha. Both great movies. Lots of other great ones on this list as well.
Sam Rockwell in Choke is just amazing. Everything he is in he brings a ton of weight to that role. He is in my top 3 favorite actors
I really enjoyed The way way back
I love Sam. His performance in JoJo Rabbit really helped *make* one of my favorite pieces of art!
This guy been in all the big movies I dont know how he gets the roles lol
this dude is awesome
No Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
Didn't even really cover his most iconic that's how great this guy is
"Stephen King did show up to set...think he got into the electric chair for 2 seconds." - LOL
People giving him all this credit for playing a spy in Argylle seem to forget that he's played spies before.
I would love to see his "Gentlemen Broncos" commentary.
Matchstick Men with Nick Cage. Loved Sam in that movie.
HOW is Captain Klenzendorf not here.
I love Moon
First time I saw him….the green mile….he was perfection in that role and I was hooked.
I like the sound of another Martin McDonagh movie with Sam and Christopher Walken, omg
I loved him in Gentlemen Broncos
Galaxy quest is one of my favorite movies all time.
What about JOJO RABBIT? Sam was excellent in that.
No teenage mutant ninja turtles is criminal it wasn’t included
Wtf. I thought he was going to talk about The Sitter or The Way Way Back or the original Ninja Turtles movie. He's gotta do another one of these with some of his better movies.
Moon
I love Sam. LOVE! but Dixon is a scumbag. A potable scumbag but still not an anti hero. Butch & Sundance, Cool Hand Luke, Rick Blaine are anti heroes. You're *supposed* to be on their side. Honestly tho, when Dixon walks into the newspaper *and just throws* the reporter out the second floor window was LEGIT one of the most terrifying scenes I've watched!
Assassination of Jesse James not being on here is criminal.
You did not include the assassination of Jesse James... one of his best. Overlooked movie just as is Sam...
Awe Gentlemen Broncos deserves a highlight too.
Sam Rockwell has been absolutely perfect in every role he plays....  Such a wonderful actor.... Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is a real great performance and the only thing better than one Rockwell is 2 in MOON, probably my favorite Rockwell Movie...
Dang, I was hoping for Jojo Rabbit to be in there
he is one of best actors, most probably ever. he steals every scene he is in. Moon, Green Mile, JoJo Rabbit, 3 Bilboards, 7 psychos... the list of awesome movies he is in is endless.
BOX FULL OF MOONLIGHT
Rockwell is amazing. Moon is one of my favourite films.
How a 2024 movie can be iconic in 2024?
I don't understand how Matchstick Men didn't make it into this list, that to me is one of Sam's best roles...
Moon is an amazing movie!
Sam Rockwell by name! Sam Rock very Well, by reputation!!!
No moon?!
I liked him a lot in Jojo Rabbit
Awesomeness!  ✊😊👊👍😆👌😎🍁♈🍁
Do GQ release an extended version?
Amazingly flexible actor!!! Main, support, co-, bit, etc. Nails it!  UNDERRATED!
MY FAVORITE ACTOR EVER
One of the best. Thank you for Sam
Looooved him in the green mile! Iconic
Zaphod's just this guy. Ya know?
Insanely underrated. Moon was amazing
No mention of his role in "Gentleman Broncos"? I'm very sad.  One of my favorites.
The way way back ❤
Of course they don’t mention JoJo Rabbit, one of his best roles.
My favourite actor of all time. There’s no one like him.
Hero!..for acting
He is the most underrated actor of our lifetime !!!!
"Sam Rockwell dances in every movie he's in."  Not really. He does in quite a few, sure. But not every single one.
He dances in every movie I think.  It seems to be his signature
he was there in this little town was this intentional haha
I wish he would talk about his time on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
I loved Lawn Dogs! personally... It was realistic most of the other half of it.
How did they leave out Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!??!
My favorite is when he dances
"Regular or Menthol?" - TMNT 1990
Zaphod's just this guy
I love him!! Every time a movie comes out and he's in it, idc what it is I go see it lol. He's so great!
Box of moonlight made me realize that my early best friends were magicians.
I'm honestly sad that the way way back wasn't part of this.
his best role was Bronco/Brutus in Gentlemen Broncos
Loved his character in Jo Jo Rabbit
There's no such thing as a bad Sam Rockwell character.
i love Sam Rockwell, been a fan ever since I saw him in the theater doing Green Mile. Very happy he spoke about Galaxy Quest and Moon here.
Amazing actor, brush your hair.
Sam Rockwell is amazing in Galaxy Quest. His freak out when they land on the alien planet, lives forever in my head rent free.
I was hoping he was gonna include Box of Moonlight, which is really what introduced Sam to me.
Studied a lot of Sam at drama School. Proper actor. Moon, wow wow just hits every note.
Don't forget he was in the original TMNT xD
Im going to go watch The Winning Season & Snow Angels for Sam.
new hair?
Galaxy Quest mini series with Simon Pegg! YES!
No Jojo Rabbit?
Hammer should reinvent ultron
Doesn't speak too much on on the villain roles...
I love that it ends with him mentioning his best performance Snow Angels!
What about Teenage mutant ninja turtles!
How is JoJo not mentioned in here
Sam IS ICONIC. Missed so many of his great films. It’s hard to have such a prolific actor on such a short show.
If they ever make a Three Jokers movie here is my Dream Cast: The Criminal Willem Dafoe, The Clown Joaquin Phoenix and The Comedian Sam Rockwell...
I liked Snow Angels. I went through a David Gordon Green phase back in the day.
No jojo rabbit?????
great actor. he can do everything dance, acsent, act. love him
Sam Rockwell really carries Argyle Movie. but Henry Cavill got TOP BILLING?!
I always get emotional at the ending of the green mile. Sam really makes you hate him and jump for glee when he gets his in that movie. True testament to a great actor.
🔥 Iconic 🔥
Choke was a great movie, led by this Sam Rockwell.
Pyramus and Thisbe! My actual favorite. Somehow he steals the scene and elevates the whole movie in less than 3 minutes :)
OMG I love you, Sam Rockwell!
Such a phenomenal actor. Don't care if you want to sell yourself short Mr. Rockwell. You have been responsible for some of the absolute best performances ever put to film.
everyone watch Moon. dooo eeet
Thank You Sam, please stay healthy.  (your T Rex thinks about you dancer)
Snow Angels?
The best secondary actor in all World:
He was great in all of his movies
okay but Gentlemen Broncos anyone?
He's one of my fav actors - wish they had discussed BOX OF MOONLIGHT and one of my favorite Rockwell's crazy performances in GENTLEMEN BRONCOS
Funny, I always thought his Zaphod Beeblebrox was based on Dubya.
Sam is one of my top three favourite character actors. Wonderful!
i sincerely think he’s a national treasure and that’s that
The next Christopher Walken go-to.
Why isnt Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on this?
Sam is in there with Gary Oldman, Tim Roth, William Fichtner and other similar actors with a near unlimited range of roles and seem under appreciated by the masses.
That real actor gave a Shakespeare play in one line and one scene thats priceless that me my friends will use forever and gets the same laugh and open joy and a why am here morgue party and why I here bar be que All I wanted was a little cornbread! I think if I can afford a grave stone and a plot I'll put that on may grave stone so idiots can say at least he ain't hungry anymore
Why no love for Gentlemen Broncos??
So glad they asked about Moon!
Best of enemies was one I liked
What about teenage mutant ninja turtles
I was really hoping they would cover "Box of Moonlight" with him.  One of my absolute favourite Sam Rockell performances!
No Jojo?!
One of my favorite character actors
Not having him talk about The Way Way Back is a crime. Wonderful movie, and he's the best part of it
Moon 🌙
He was brilliant in Gentlemen Broncos.
No ninja turtles 😮 regular or menthol. Check the East warehouse over on lairman island.
Sam Rockwell can elevate anything he's in! It wasn't mentioned here, but I thought he was excellent in Matchstick Men.
What about Jo Jo Rabbit?!!!!
I saw Sam in 2005 just walking in a sweatsuit on the streets of Manhattan. He stopped to talk to me for like 20 minutes and was so nice.
You walk in on your legs but you going to leave on your backs while Bill guarantee that 😅😂🤣🤣🤣
I like how he lists his specific inspirations for each role, and gives credit to the original actors. You don't really see that too often.
Pivotal character actor.
First saw him in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, one of my favorite films
Such a gifted actor. A true master.
Besides the on point acting, love his dance moves
I was hoping he'd cover Box of Moonlight. That's one of my faves, but I'm not sure how well known or popular it is.
I'm surprised no Jojo Rabbit. I think that's one of his best roles.
Sam Rockwell is terrific and so unique.
Probably my favorite actor
No Gentleman Broncos?! Sad.
"HE'S FRYIN' NOW !"
Wish they would have discussed his role in "the way way back"...
Captain K! Whoooo!
WTF? No Gentleman Broncos? That's his masterpiece. I could understand the omission if you wanted to keep the list all hoity toity, pinkies-out-drinking-tea-Oscar mumbo jumbo, but then there's Charlie's Angels? lol OK...
WTF! No Ninja Turtles?
I know it’s a voice role but I’d have loved to see some love for The Bad Guys on here. It’s my favorite thing he’s done.
Disappointed he didn't talk about his most iconic role, in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
Fantastic actor
The Winning Season is a gem of a movie. He plays a great character. No surprise there, I guess.
My favorite role of his is Moon. I honestly just love that movie.
AMOR DE MI VIDAAAAA
Moon is terrific
Eric Knox was such a cool villain. Also that is a cool name.
Sam Rockwell is one acting (and dancing) mf.
BOX OF MOONLIGHT - KID... WHERE IS IT?
He is an aaaaamazing actor. He doesn’t half @ss anything.  I need to binge his movies this weekend. 🫶💗  really loved hearing his inspirations for characters.
Criminally underrated
Sam was also in a movie called  "Clown House" a long time ago. He was much younger at that time.
So many Sam Films I’ve missed, some great catching up to do.
Sam is for sure underrated!
2 minuets for moon... come on that's an amazing film
"It had 17 writers and only ONE of them was a woman, and it was a movie about WOMEN." Love him for this.
He was the perfect choice for the lead in "Choke"
Sam's Gary Oldman's American cousin, in spirit and talent.😊😂
i watched Moon in a film class in college and loved it.  I appreciate you Mr. Rockwell.
I first got to know him through Moon. That movie was exceptional and a very underrated sci-fi film
Actually he's on Micheal Keaton arc
He's on the Gary Oldman track
Aw no Matchstick Men. He made me like a Cage movie!
Sam has finally evolved into his final Willam Dafoe state.
If Sam Rockwell is in the movie, then I'm checking it out. Loved his character(s) in Gentlemen Broncos as well.
Why is Argyle in this? lol stupid ad.
Box of Moonlight!
I caught moon on tv late in the evening and couldn't stop watching it. It was such a great movie and I've enjoyed Sam ever since in anything he does
How can you not cover the great, THE WAY, WAY BACK?
Sam is such a name dropper! Lol
Where's his appearance in the first Ninja Turtles movie.
Sam Rockwell has always been one of my favorite actors of all time with Cillian Murphy, both incredibly talented and underrated performers just like most of their filmography. I’m glad he brought up how under the radar Moon, The Winning Season and Snow Angels are and how aware he is about some of his movies that are absolute gems (in my movie collection). Lawn Dogs Matchstick Men Choke Frost/Nixon Conviction The Way, Way Back Better Living Through Chemistry  Jojo Rabbit Richard Jewell To name a few more. Too many to go over but I’d love to hear him talk about these as well.
My guy for the joker role. 100%!!
Such an underrated actor!!!
Moon is such in Gem. If you are into Interstellar movie genre , go watch it. But keep it mine it was made on a 5 million dollar budget. Still I love the atmostphere of that movie.
FINALLY dudes the goat. Moon and Jesse James are unreal
they're all iconic because he's legitimately one of the best actors of the generation
Easiest answer to the question of 'who is the most underrated actor ever?'
This guy dances like that Loki guy.
No matchstick Men?
Best one yet
I’m just here to recommend Moon to everyone. One of my favorite movies
MOON
04:47 I'm willing to bet that by the way he changes his posture it wasn't an easy character to play. I belive that for any actor or actress, especially when they're just starting, it's not easy to play a despicable character and he did, and he did great. One of the reasons I love this actor is that he doesn't seem to have the typical diva complex that many have, he seems quite relaxed and dresses very casually
Insanely disappointing they didn’t lead with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Its iconic to me!
Guy Crewman #6 ... epic role. Seen that movie like 100 times.
They didn't speak about Jojo Rabbit??!! How did they NOT talk about Jojo Rabbit???!!!
what is a partner?
Underrated legend
The best actor of our time
I was hoping he would talk about MOON. Great film.
He’s a fly under the radar phenomenal dancer and literally every roll he’s played has been remarkable! One of my favorites for sure!
Gotdamn, I clicked play so fast. I am in love with Sam Rockwell!!!
Moon was my introduction to Sam Rockwell, and it's a shame he doesn't get more leading parts in films.  He's awesome.
Nah Sam you can say it!!! You’re iconic🫡
“Regular or menthol?”
_Galaxy Quest_ and _Hitchhikker's Guide to the Galaxy_ are arguably my favorite films with Sam. His comedic timing is absolutely on point.
Dude is a fascinating interview, wish he would do them more often.  Super underrated actor imho.
He didn't mention Box of Moonlight with John Tuturro. Very low budget but one of my favorite movies.
Jojo Rabbit?
Welcome to Collingwood is one of the most underrated comedy movies ever and Rockwell’s performance was a major part of that
Never stop dancing Sam
Love your acting Sam. You made every movie you’ve been in better.
He looks homeless
Sam is one of a few actors where I will watch anything he does. Truly an original and a great performer.
Matchstick Men??? When a Ridley Scott film doesn't make the cut, you've had some career!
I think this person is one of the greatest actors ever! Why not TMNT?!
How did they not include the Bad Guys?! He nailed it as Wolf!!!
What about Band of Brothers!! 🤦‍♂️I was waiting for George Luz breakdown,..
Justin Hammer is an icon
some day he'll get to be Gary Oldman
I thought he'd pop up in Falcon and Winter Soldier at least. Justin Hammer was great.
He should be more famous
"I don't think I can say iconic about myself" , lol
Seven Psychopaths
Kinda upset they didn't cover Jojo Rabbit
no CHOKE?
My favorite line of his is still "Regular or menthol?"
Moon , with amazing performance of Rockwell ,  is  the last masterpiece of sci fi in these last  18 years of almost nothing in the culture and in the cinema and dystopic society  !!!
Criminal underrated.
And couldn't include Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? Lol
Legend anyone?
Moon is one of the best ever.
No JoJo Rabbit?
Vic, his animated character in "F is for Family" (co-created by Bill Burr, another legend!) is incredible!
Hey, it's that one guy!
“IS THERE AIR?! YOU DONT KNOW!”
No teenage mutant ninja turles? (1990) tut tut sam
Love his dancing.  And Galaxy Quest rules!  One of my favorite movies of all time and so funny but Sam was the funniest in it.
Wanted to hear him talk about assassination of Jesse James
MOON is one of the most overlooked masterpieces in Sci-Fi.
I'm sorry but how can you not include his voice actor perfomance in "The Bad Guys".
One of the best. He has never turned in a bad performance.
Jojo Rabbit?
First really saw him in 3 Billboards. Absolutely fantastic
Sam Rockwell is Gary Oldman! change my mind!
this dude is so underrated. amazing actor.
Was really hoping they'd bring up his character in Stella
I was hoping Sam would mention his small part in the 1990 teenage mutant ninja turtles because as a very young kid I thought he was so cool in that part and he definitely is in real life.
3 billboards is what made me love his acting. Probably top 10 movie for tbh
Moon is such an underrated masterpiece...
What about TMNT?
Choke is my favorite of his. But any movie with him, im in.
His best role is The Green Mile. I can totally see his actor influences for Galaxy Quest! Can't unsee now.
I forgot he was in green mile!    One of my favorites of his is zaphpoid beeble brox
He was amazing in Choke, I kept waiting for him to mention it.
Did I miss the TMNT???
This video should be twice as long, and it still wouldn't be enough.
In 2009 Milk won the Oscar for best actor and best original screenplay - Moon deserves both
my favorite mcu villain lol couldve fought thanos himself
I wish they would have talked about Welcome to Collinwood, that is perhaps my favorite Sam Rockwell performance, absolute legend!
Yes Sam Rockwell is iconic. So many great roles
I’m kinda emo that Sam is getting his flowers 💐 in the comments 🥲
No mention of The Way Way Back? Criminal!!!
Simon Peg and Galaxy Quest 2 would be outstanding 😊
GQ2!!!! Yes Please!!!!!
While I don't think chronological order is a necessity, though it would show the development of the artist, the complete lack of any rhyme or reason is bizarre.
his most iconic role is the OG ninja turtles "anything you want we got, anyting you wanna do.. do it"
DUDE... you HAVE to make a Galaxy Quest series. That would be amazing.
Ninja turtles
Sam Rockwell is just amazing in whatever he's in.  He had a cameo in "A Case of You", with Justin Long. The movie didn't stand out, but his scenes sure did. That's just his elevating power. Sam's the MSG in the recipe.
What, no Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
so glad they mentioned Moon, still one of my favorite Scifi films
I love this guy.  He just impresses me more, with every role.  So glad I got to hear him talk about "Moon".  I found that one very moving.
He's got such a unique charm. You can't replicate it. I f****ng love him. Edit: I saw The Winning Season and Snow Angels.
Can't believe he didn't discuss The Assassination Of Jesse James.
Ok Galaxy Quest limited series would be  amazing…
one of my favorite actors. i saw Moon in some little tiny arthouse theatre and instantly became a fan
Love this guy, someone needs to put him and Cage in another movie, Cohen bros can you hear me?
I can't believe they didn't talk about his greatest role: Hickory in Trolls World Tour
Moon is amazing film. Saw it in an empty cinema. Felt just as alone as him.
No Jo Jo Rabbit?
Well now I have about 6 or 7 movie to watch the next month
it's a shame that Jojo Rabbit wasn't included
He is the successor of Gary Oldman
Plus 1 for GC Limited Series. Guy my fav character.
Plus 1 for GC Limited Series. Guy my fav character.
Wish you would have included Jo Jo Rabbit in the breakdowns.
The first movie I watched him in was a little indie film called A Box of Moonlight.  Ever since then I've been a fan of his.
No Jojo Rabbit? He hard carried that film.
SAFE MEN
Ok I guess we’ll pretend The Assassination of Jesse James doesn’t exist and just talk about his lesser performances
Sup
Sam worked with Gene Hackman and Robert De Niro but didn't have time to talk about it?
Was hoping to hear about Richard jewel film and Eastwood as the director
Sam is an amazing stage actor as well. I saw him in the play with Christopher Walken on Broadway several years ago and they were both incredible!  Also let’s not forget his role as a foot soldier in the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie haha
He was great in TMNT :P
Let's not forget his epic role in Teeage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
I think Sam would play a great Joker in a Batman movie.
Rockwell never disappoints
SAM IS A PHENOMENAL ACTOR! I hope he knows this😢
Did they miss TMNT?
He just wanted him some cornbread 😂
No Assassination of Jesse James? Arguably one of his best performances
I still think he's underrated, even after winning the Oscar.
I wish they also did Jojo Rabbit, i loved him in that too
Teenage Mutant ninja turtles Was the first movie i watched with him in it
Bro we loved his character! Lol the part where he was dancing then they show pepper pots reaction in the audience always cracks me up
I would have liked to hear his take on "Choke."
No Jesse James?
Nothing about Conviction with Hilary Swank? One of his best performance
By Grabthar's Hammer let there be Galaxy Quest 2
I was gonna be so tilted if moon wasnt on here!
The sitter
Was waiting for him to discuss Matchstick Men, loved that movie!
Phew! I was wondering if they were ever going to mention Moon... sheesh! ;P
Seven Psychopaths is marvellous!
His first role is in the 1990 Ninja Turtles movie as the guy who sells cigarettes to Foot Soldier recruits.
Jojo Rabbit?? Choke?? The Way Way Back?? Come onnnnn.
Love this guy
One of my favorite actors of all time. Moon is such an underrated masterpiece.
Guy !
The GOAT so criminally not talked about enough. Hes great.
No JoJo Rabbit???
This guy always reminds me of Gary Oldman, both is performance & looks. Absolutely smashed it in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri 👌
Not asking him about TMNT!!? What a shame!
Awesome 👏 been waiting for one like this ❤
Green mile he was great in that
Sam can dance !
Wow! and My favorit performance of Sam Rockwell in 2008´s "Choke" is not even in this list. What a actor what a artist.
I looovvveeee sam rockwell. He is one of those actors that is always great on the screen 🙂🙂
They didn't mention two fantastic performances of his - Box of Moonlight & Glory Daze. He's awesome.
You couldn't have asked about TMNT?!?!?!  DO YOUR RESEARCH GQ
Easily one of my absolute Favorite performers.  I try to see just about everything he does. 😁
sam rockwell rocks
I came for Charlie's Angels and Charlie's Angels only.
The way way back
I was impressed by his performance in Moon.
I remember Sam in the first TMNT movie 🐢
Argylle 34% on RT
Where's Richard Jewell??
Box of Moonlight, Lawn Dogs, Safe Men... these are the films I discovered Sam Rockwell in and knew I'd be keeping an eye out for him.
Hands down Moon is his best movie in my opinion. I love that flick so much
He becomes his characters so well that you tend to remember the character much better than the actor who played them. And this has the issue of not getting in the celebrity spotlight as much. Basically: "He was THAT guy?! I loved that guy, what else was he in? I loved that guy too! I didn't even know they were played by the same actor!"
I guess nobody is going to mention Choke or Gentlemen Broncos
I would have loved to hear about his role in "snow Angels"
Snow Angels is devastating. It's unfortunate that a movie like that falls under the radar.
Seven Psychopaths is the best movie ever made
I really wish we saw "The way way back" here. I loved his character in the film in that he was a great mentor/father figure to the main character. That movie made me a Sam Rockwell fan.
Matchstick men is one of my favourite Sam Rockfall films.
This interview was two short.
The first time I saw Sam Rockwell was in LAWN DOGS. Say what you will about the movie, but I remember thinking he was brilliant in it, and have tried to catch him in everything since. He brings a quirkiness to every project which makes him interesting to watch. A scene stealer.
Great actor your definitely an icon
The most iconic thing about sam is his dancing.
him and Ryan Gosling 👍He doesn't get the credit he deserves. Green Mile and Moon are outstanding (plus I have a soft spot for Hitchhikers)
I know there is a movie out there that is just made for him. Something that makes you root for the bad guy type.
"Regular or menthol?"  If you know you know.
Sam Rockwell has had such fascinating roles! Some I had seen and some I didn't know he was in! Crazy that was him in Charlie's Angels!! Didn't know who he was then! Drew Barrymore looked hot! Galaxy Quest seems like a comedy of Alien and Star Trek! 3:00am 7.2.2024
Moon. Underrated movie. Love when Sam is in movies. Guy always brings it. I almost forgot, he was in The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy." Any role, Big or small, he crushes it.
If he won't say it, I will. He is an absolute icon. <3
If you get the chance, watch 'Box of Moonlight'.  That was the movie that made me a fan of Sam Rockwell.
Matchstick Men, Better Living Through Chemistry.
Please reprise Justin hammer I love that character
So then it sounds like (by the sound of it) he and walken are in Martin Mccdonaghs next film. I'm getting harder than portland cement just thinking about it.
Seven Psychopaths is one of my favorite movies! Not a bad movie in video.
Really enjoyed him in the assassination of jesse james, how did he not talk about it?
not having jojo rabbit is INSANE
I really wanted to see Sam in a Coen bros comedy. Too bad they’re not working together anymore.
Wish he would have talked about his performance as the bad guy in _The Sitter_ (2011). Hilarious.
LOVED HIM IN CONVICTION WITH HILARY SWANK....A MUST WATCH!!!!!!! VERY UNDERATED FILM! IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THIS LIST...........
The entire time I’m watching this I was preparing to get angry if they didn’t include Moon. One of his best roles.
2:00 another great movie
The Bad Guys? Nothing on voice acting?
7 Psychopaths is one of my favorite movies period. One of the reasons why is Rockwell.
Sam Rockwell is my spirit animal.
Anyone seen Lawn Dogs? Great in that.
Sam, those of us who saw Moon, especially at the cinema, will never ever forget it. Appreciation. Moon and District 9 came out in the same year, two of the greatest movies ever.
Too bad he didnt discuss JoJo Rabbit
I loved the Moon! Glad it was mentioned. (Also The Green Mile but that's a classic tbh.)
Sam and Walken are my 2 fav actors. 7 Psychopaths was a great movie.
The way way back is another underrated great movie w him
Wild Bill may have been an awful person but Rockwell absolutely hit it out of the park playing him.
I’m such a huge Sam Rockwell fan, and wanting that I really loved about this interview is how much respect he has for the craft and skill of his fellow actors, and how much he draws upon them as models for inspiration. This is a guy who clearly studies all aspects of cinema
Wish he talked about Choke, underrated movie
As Wild Bill in The Green Mile, I don't think I've ever hated a character so much. It was a testament to his acting. He made you hate him. He played that role perfectly.
What about the way way back?
About time GQ.
Sad they didn't touch on The Assassination of Jesse James, great character acting in that one. Sam is an amazing actor, comedy, drama, action, classic - really anything you can put him in.
GALAXY QUEST SEQUEL?!!.. Yes,Please!!! Galaxy Quest 2: The Rise of Fleegman
Sam Rockwell just oozes charisma and personability. I'd love to just sit around a back porch and share a beer with em'.
Captain K in jojo rabbit?
GQ slippin. Yall did Kurt Russel, not a word about Jack Burton, you got Sam Rockwell, and not a word about Gentlemen Broncos. Steppit Up.
One of the greatest actors of that generation
Moon is defined one of my favourite movies by him
No Jojo Rabbit?  “Captain K, woohoo!” — such a memorable character.
No Ninja Turtles?!?
Sam is my favourite actor, have always enjoyed his choice of film and acting. Thank you Sam
I bought the movie 7 psychopaths way back when, only because I seen that Sam was in it. I was not disappointed.
A smaller movie not mentioned is Lawn Dogs. Very impactful and he was very different in it to other characters I’ve seen him play.
Totally agree with what he says about comedy!
justin hammer was one if the best mcu performances of alll time
I'd bet most of you have watched seven psychopaths. And you need to.
The Way Way back is a beautiful movie and he had a great role in it, pity it was not included here
I can always sit and watch Moon. Really great movie
should have asked him about ninja turtles
My favorite actor! So happy to see him featured here! And very happy that Hitchhiker's Guide was included.Choke, Laggies, F is for Family, Matchstick Men... just so many more titles he could speak on.
Was hoping Sam would break down 'Way Way Back.'  I loved his character in that movie.  Great and fun father/brother mentor to the protagonist.  Fun Fact: Sam had a really small role in the 1990s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie!
His performance in Gentleman Broncos is the greatest 😆👍🏻 If you love Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre you owe it to yourself to see this film
my favourite movie is not included “Assasination of Jesse James” with Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. Sam was brilliant in that role.
Looking forward to Armor Wars, really hope Sam gets hired on for it, I like Justin Hammer. Justin Hammer needs to improv a dance in his own armor suit.
Frost/Nixon was a particular highlight
Moon and The Way Way Back are his two best roles for me.
Ummm.. No Matchstick men?
I LOVE confessions of a dangerous minds.  That’s his best performance personally
Most underrated actor I swear
How Gentleman Broncos didn't make it into this is... I mean... it makes sense. Only me and two other people have ever seen that movie (and they both hated it)... but it's insane. It's the most Sam Rockwell he's ever been.
Rockwell is fantastic in The Way Way Back. He is fantastic in everything. Argylle is such fun
I wish they had covered Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990)!  😆  Punk:  "Ya got any cigarettes?"  Sam:   "Regular,  or menthol?"  😂👍
His character in The Way Way Back is so underrated and so important because he felt like that awesome big brother that the protagonist and at some point everyone needs.
THANK YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOU
14:19 WHAT ON EARTH IS IN HIS THROAT? ALIEN CREATURE DaFack
No TMNT talk?!?  Great interview but wish Turtles could have been touched on quick. Next time
CHOKE
Where’s Box of Moonlight?
Choke????????
The coolest guy on earth.
whyJojo Rabbit is not here
What about Poltergeist 2015 and Jojo Rabbit 2019? I know it might not be the best Poltergeist remake, but I still expected it to be on this list.
I really like 'The Way Way Back'
I loved him in the Way Way Back! Such underrated actor
My late dad used to quote Wild Bill around the house, which formed some incredibly funny memories lmao
The whole time I was waiting for him to talk about Snow Angels. And Choke.
No mention of Captain K in Jojo Rabbit? Swing and a miss I guess.
I love Mr Nice Guy.. Was hoping he'd speak to it.
I wish they would have had him talk about matchstick men. Great movie.loved him in Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
TMNT 1990!
saw argyle was a spy action comedy starring sam rockwell and went to watch it (haven't kept up with movie news in a while so i didn't catch the awful trailer). oof. he's the only halfway worthwhile part of the movie and you can still tell which scenes were filmed after he gave up and started phoning it in with everyone else. to think this stinker would have paid for 40 "Moon"s
Reading people keep saying  he's underrated this seems wrong.  He's a working actor, in demand  and pops up in surprising roles. Always very watchable and seems like a private guy, not constantly squeezing his face in to the lime light. The power is his to choose, always interesting roles. What role should he be in to make him more rated??
No TMNT??
One of the most underrated actor of last 25 years. His performance in Moon was Oscar worthy. Hope to see him in some prominent roles in the future.
Such an underrated actor!!!!
Eric Knox holds a very special place in my heart. The scene where he transitions to a bad guy changed me. I love Sam Rockwell in anything and everything.
You forgot 1990’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!?!
Check out the East warehouse on Lairdman Island
moon was fantastic
A Galaxy Quest series? Wow! Although Alan Rickman's loss would be palpable. He was the perfect salty, sardonic and sullen counterbalance to Tim Allen's brilliant boisterous bravado.
Moon, was the title that showed how truly talented he is.
Such an underrated actor!!!
Sam Rockwell is super underrated. One of my favorite modern actors for sure (don't have too many). Keep on rocking Mr. Rockwell. Do it.
Moon will always have a special place in my heart for movies.
Zyphood Beeeeblebrox is my favorite role of his.
He played in argylle soooo well one of his best movies yet 👌🏽
Some actors are great because they disappear into a character. Ed Harris, for instance. Others are great because they have a charisma or presence they bring to every character. Brando and Pacino would be examples, or even Matthew McConaughey. To me, Rockwell somehow is the best of both worlds.
GENTLEMAN BRONCOS!
Sam Rockwell is one of, if not the most, underappreciated actor or there.
Great actor  Great dancer
…… so no G-force?
Does chronology have anything to do with the setup? IT WOULD HELP
Such an underrated actor!
omg of the greatest actors alive, full stop.
..I was hoping he talked about "The assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" 😔
I have read how he was in many stuff when he won his Oscar, watching this I had no idea.....
Justin Hammer better come back.
Shame about Jojo Rabbit missing, even in all the comments I've read so far.
ROCKWELL IS ON MY TOP 10 ACTORS❤❤❤❤
Can't forget Gentlemen Broncos - a personal favorite of mine.
It's a shame they fluffed Hitchhiker's Guide so badly, because Sam Rockwell made a perfect Zaphod.
Loved him in Moon and Green Mile.
I thought it was Seth Green
LOOOOONG overdue. Love this guy.
Moon is unironically my most favorite movie of all time
Love Sam but Argyle was so painful to watch. Its the worst movie ive seen in a while. Shake it off, onto the next
The Justin Hammer dance should go down in history 😂
MOON is a real rockwell masterpiece that deserves more attention.
No Jo Jo Rabbit? He was incredible in that one. So underrated
David Bowie - Duncan Jones' father  Well yeah but also!
He seems like such a cool guy. One of the few actors you'd want as a friend I think.
SAM ROCKWELL IS VICTOR MANCINI IN CHOKE! SAW IT TWICE IN THEATERS! WISH HE SPOKE ABOUT THAT MOVIE!
I really enjoyed him in Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind.
Great selection of films, so glad Seven Psychopaths was featured
Sam Rockwell was great in Box of Moonlight, still my favourite of many wonderful performances.
First time I saw him was in Charlie's Angels 😇 he played the smooth bad guy very well.
No mention of his TMNT part, what a travisity.
Moon. I have so many great memories working on that film. It's a crime he didn't get an Oscar nomination for it.
I loved the winning season. Definitely deserved better
Matthew McConaugHE is the most elevated pronunciation I’ve ever heard.
"Cyclops there. Cyclops there." - Gentlemen Broncos!
Was worried they weren’t gonna cover seven psychopaths at first. Also wish he covered the way way back
I would've loved to hear him talk about his role in Frost/Nixon...such an interesting movie and incredibly underrated, hardly hear anyone mention it
BEST ROLE is him in the original TMNT as one of the hoods
Galaxy Quest is great!
The first time I remember seeing Sam in anything was the TMNT movie lol
Came here only to listen to him talk about "The Way, Way Back" and it didn't even make the cut. Bogus.
So underrated
Sam was great in "Heist", with Gene Hackman. Moon is one of my all time favourites.
3 billboards hit so hard. Great film 😢
Simply wonderful ❤
Awesome but ask him about Ninja Turtles…
"Didn't mean to broke his nose, it was just in the middle of where I was punching him"
Simon Pegg + Galaxy Quest TWOOOO? GET ON IT ❤❤❤
I will-and have- watch anything with Sam Rockwell. He’s like Gary Oldman and just transforms into every role and is so charismatic and captivating to watch. He’s up there with Betty White for talents you hope you never have to say goodbye to. I can’t wait for the next Rockwell project, no matter what it is. I’d watch him clean toilets for three hours
One of the goats
I knew nothing about this guy. This was amazing. Thank you
I am surprised they did not mention his role in the first  ninja turtles film  the "regular or menthol" guy was his greatest moment.
I did my Film studies essay on Moon and the Sam’s. Great performance
13:00 - The crazy last after he says you could go crazy.
Oh, no mention of his GREATEST performance ever in TMNT 1990 "Regular or Menthol?"
They didn't even bring up gentleman broncos?!??
Literally one of the greatest actors maybe ever.
He was the best part of the best Star Trek movie.
No Matchstick Men?
where did he say he met George Clooney??
Richard Jewel. He’s amazing in that!
If i ever met him in real life id yell "WE HAVE A LOYALTY TO THE SHREDDA!!"
He was in the first TMNT movie 1990s
How could you not include Gentlemen Broncos!?
Love this dude. He doesn't seem overly thrilled to be here, however. Ok with me.
No Tmnt? Lol
No Jojo Rabbit? That was his best role!
Welcome To Colliwood was hysterical
Captain K, in Jojo Rabbit!?
So y'all just gonna forget Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles like that?
I've never realised how technically complicated his character is were
What I wouldn't give for a Galaxy Quest limited series
Moon ...say no more
I absolutely loved the way way back! I love those coming kf age films like that. Rockwell made that film.
I always get so excited when I see him pop up in a movie! He’s definitely one of my favorite actors!!
Shame he didn't talk about his breakout role in 1990's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
Would have loved to ask him about Gentlemen Broncos. He looked like he was having a blast with that one.
Moon is the Sam Rockwell movie to watch. There's even more Rockwells for your buck.
I constantly feel that Sam Rockwell is one of the most underrated actors currently. I often forget he is in other movies because he is such a chameleon. He’s likable even when he’s a bad guy…., he’s full of energy and commits to the character.
On the day I tell my girlfriend Sam Rockwell is my favourite actor!
Loved him in The Way Way Back - he was perfect
He was awesome in the Richard Jewel movie too.
No mention of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : (
Sam Rockwell is the best actor of all time I watch anything he’s in
I would love to see him return in Marvel Studios’ Armor Wars
I know it is contreversial, but i really want to know his opinions about clownhouse
No love for Box of Moonlight...
No Jojo rabbit?!!? For Shame!!!
Galaxy Quest is one of my favorites. Moon was super under rated.
WILD BILL!!!!!😍😍😍😍
Living legend!!!
Just saw Argylle, and again he made the movie better! Can do anything.
I only skimmed this video but I didn’t see/hear any reference to his role in the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie.  0/10 GQ
Sam you are an awesome and talented actor and I love everything you've been in! A real gem
No Lawn Dogs?
He teases SO much in this video! So many exciting things to look forward to with one of the GOAT screen actors!!
His role in The Green Mile is, without question, one of the great performances in cinema.
However you rate Sam Rockwell's acting, it will always be underrated
TMNT 1990 is missing there, great actor!
I know! You construct a weapon. Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?
Can't .believe y'all overlooked him in Matchstick Men. Great performance in a great movie.
Love Sam. Isn’t a thing he’s done that I haven’t loved.
Sam Rockwell. Fantastic amazing actor. Always a pleasure to watch him for years now
No Alan Rickman, no Galaxy Quest.
Too downtown ? I agree.
100% top 5 favorite actors of all time for me. I love Charlie’s angels with a passion bc I was a kid but his role is the best in the movie and absolutely did not see it coming
i love sam rockwell!!! stunning actor not celebrated enough
He is the best! I have always loved his energy
Can't believe he didn't talk about the graveyard scene in Seven Psychopaths. The combination of his delivery, pantomiming all the characters in the shootout, and clumsily flipping through his script and spilling his drink is the hardest I ever laughed at a movie.
BUT WHAT ABOUT BRONCO/BRUTUS
Eric loves chris and juan love them
Matchstick Men. He was great in that one, too.
No TMNT?  Lame.
Im an absolute Sam Rockwell stan! Lovely to see him get one of these.. ps.. Matchstick Men is an underrated movie.
I'd love to hear him talk about Box Of Moonlight. Great film.
I'm just here to see if he's gonna speak on his role in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
I forgot he was Zephod in Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy. He was just as hilarious as the book version.
The Winning Season is really great - check it out.
BOX FULL OF MOONLIGHT!!!!
I see Sam Rockwell as one of those actors who burns through lines because of how much he talks in movies, and how fast he can talk as well.  He must be a writer's nightmare if he is ever cast with someone who is the same.
A shame they didn't have JoJo rabbit included. His performance though a bit more limited was outstanding.
This clip is not long enough to reference all of Sam's great roles.
Legenda👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
Echoing many here by writing that Sam Rockwell is one of the finest actors living today.
needs some JOJO Rabbit!
Sam always seems to put in a lot of Keaton into his performance.
TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES
Bring back Justin Hammer!
Sam Rockwell is SOOOOO underrated. He's such a great and passionate actor
Love Sam Rockwell and his many many facets throughout his career playing so many versatile rolls. However, one roll that I found incredibly funny that is not listed here was when he played Captain Klenzendorf in Jojo Rabbit. Truly an amazing character with moments of laughter mixed with moments of sadness.
I absolutely love the way Sam talks. His cadence has almost a rhythmic sense to it and his inflection on certain words. I could listen to this guy talk all day.
Galaxy Quest 2 with a tribute to the late great Alan Rickman..... YES!!!!! Get it done!
Galaxy Quest 2 ?     Y E S   P L E A S E !
Would loved to have heard him breakdown his character in The Way, Way Back.
No Gentlemen Broncos?!?
Jojo Rabbit?!
I wish he covered the Way, War Back-such a great role for him
Acting: so easy a caveman can do it.   (I promise i <3 Sam Rockwell)
Huh? His name his Tom Cruise
Love this guy!
His character Elon M.. I mean Justin Hammer is amazing
brilliant career, Galaxy Quest is on my must watch list.
Seth Rogen got 43 minutes
I simply can’t NOT watch Sam whenever, wherever he is on the screen…. Love the guy!
Loved him since Box Of Moonlight
He's played so many amazing roles. he absolutely nailed Zaphod, one of my favorite performances ever.
my favourite movie of his is still Gentlemen Broncos.
Sam Rockwell is one of the greatest actors of our time. This dude is a living legend! Great interview.
What about Vic Reynolds on F is for Family?..... one of the best animated characters ever.
Assassination of Jesse James
Leaving out Moon and Gentleman Broncos... unforgivable. Edit- my mistake. moon at the end.
Seven Psychopaths is off the charts amazing. He’s amazing in it. I tell everyone to watch it.
He was a scene stealer in Ironman 2
I knew they wouldn’t include The Way Way Back but I absolutely loved him in that movie.
This guy is my first choice to play the hero in "Duty Bound" of the John Archer adventure book series.
No Gentlemen Broncos?
No questions about JOJO ??
Invite Sylvester Stallone❤
He is just so amazing
No Lawn Dogs 👎
Love this guy!   And i do enjoy his dancing
Moon is the most under-rated Movie period. Its soundtrack is bittersweet and Sam does fantastic to carry the movie on his own.
and they didn't even mention Teenage mutant ninja turtles..........
Duncan Jones father lol
Moon is fantastic! A top tier example of heady scifi done without any sort of budget to speak of.
Moon was awesome
Was hoping to hear him talk about Lawn Dogs or Matchstick Men.
Heist is a film that is super underrated/underappreciated. Highly recommend it.
No the way way back? Very unfortunate
The Dixon character in Three Billboards always stammers when he says mother.  Makes me wonder if she abused him when he was a boy
You didn’t ask him about Ninja Turtles, which means you failed!
No mention of Choke? Such an underrated movie.
to all the robots searching for keywords, I would love a Galaxy Quest 2 with Simon Pegg attached to it somehow.
I was hoping he'd talk about the TMNT movie, it's not an iconic role but I would have like to see what he'd say about it.
Just an amazing actor! Jojo Rabbit and The Way Way Back were fantastic and should have had a mention
His character in The Green Mile was so...vile and evil. Like, the only goal he has is hurt as many people as possible. It stuck with me for days after watching the movie. Great writing and acting.
How have you not included The Way Way Back?!? Such a beautifully magical movie about the transition between childhood innocence and adult bewilderment… Sam Rockwell’s character is the heart of the film.
I loved him in Hitchiker's!
I wish there would have been mention of his role in, “Choke” but I don’t think anyone saw that film lol
What, no Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
This guy's been underrated since the '90s.
He's one  of the best. Even if the rest of the movie doesn't turn out to be great, Sam Rockwell never disappoints.
How is there no Jojo rabbit?
First thing I remember seeing him in was Heist. I love that movie.
You don't often hear actors reference so many movies.
Who was the interviewer? I feel like there were some missed engagement moments.
Well, I must admit to the fact that the Rockwell name lives is multiple forms of art. I have heard this man's name thrown around all my life in reference to great film.   All that said, utterly, I am ashamed I did not know he was Wild Bill.
Always been the most underatted actor in Hollywood. Him and Jake gyllenhallllls choose their movies well, they're as reliable as directors.
It’s insane he was in Galaxy Quest and Green Mile the same year, I don’t think an actor’s had a better breakout year than that.
Skipping Ninja Turtles is a hate crime.
That has to be the first time an Actor goes on about other films that GQ didn't care to acknowledge, what a shiv to Mr Rockwell
He sounds and looks like he just woke up lmao
Incredible range and talent. He plays his roles so well.
Galaxy Quest is his best for me
Love this guy, he always seems such a maverick in the roles he plays almost like he dances around the script without actually sticking to it. Seems so natural on screen.
I remember seeing The Green Mile, Galaxy Quest, and Charlie's Angels all within ~2 years of each other and not truly realizing until my senior year of high school when I saw Hitchhiker's Guide they were all him and just being blown away. Sam Rockwell is one of those actors who elevates whatever he is in and completely owns his role. Him saying they were thinking about WF or JC for Hitchhiker's had me thinking I could understand why they might want them, but Sam owns that role and I don't think either of them could have pulled it off how he did.
Why tease us with a Galaxy Quest 2 with Simon Pegg writing... RIP Alan.
Sam Rockwell is one of the most underrated actors of all time
honorable mentions should have been thrown in at least with the way way back and JoJo Rabbit.
Sam Rockwell as Tony Stark would have been a game changer for movie casting the way RDJ was.
I could watch Sam Rockwell do his taxes and be entertained.
Sam Rockwell is an incredible actor, every role he puts his all in except one role. The Poltergeist remake was atrocious and it seemed like Sam had phoned it in, the original still is terrifying why he didn't throw the same prowess into the film will only be known to himself.
Jojo Rabbit ?
No F is for Family???? what a let down
most underrated actor.
We love you Sam.
One of the best of our time, love Sam Rockwell
Moon.. great movie
My favourite actor.. Icon for sure!
That sumbitch playing Wild Bill in The Green Mile will forever make me call him a sumbitch. lol
I would have also accepted "Zaphod, he's just zis guy... ya know?"
He mentions that they had had a great Charlie Kaufman script For Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, but he doesn’t mention that scumbag liar Chuck Barris was allowed In to do rewrites as though he knows how to write(and as if his ego would allow any ambiguity to challenge the “reality” of his story)anything, and milquetoast, status quo director George Clooney thought the script was too “funky” to be a successful film(a real innovative spirit there).     So Confessions is one of the great missed opportunities in recent film history. It could have been a real classic with a ballsy director in control. It’s a shame.
Sam was in TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES (1990). Yes I know he wasn’t in it a lot but still.
Stay with me. Sam Rockwell is one of the sexiest men in Hollywood.
Just here for all the comments using the word underrated lol
I want Sam to be my buddy. I can cook a nice casserole!
The greatest Sam Rockwell role, Galaxy Quest.
Sam's just the coolest.
Charlie's Angels.
Sam Rockwell is awesome.
Cowboys And Aliens.
I know it's not "iconic" but he's fantastic in The Way Way Back.
Was awesome in Jo Jo Rabbit.
One of my favorite actors. So underrated
awesome actor! He elevates everything he's in!
Sam Rockwell as Solid Snake.
It looks like the character never let him go haha! Legend!
My favorite role did was The Way Way Back
Recently saw Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and he was a foot clan punk.  What an iconic role!
Just when EXACTLY did Sam Rockwell turn into Duncan Trussell?
Gentleman Bronco is all you need to know. GQ doesn't know...ughhh
TMNT 1990 ? regular or menthol
Very underrated actor of our time.
Brilliant actor and a true chameleon. If he’s in a movie I’m interested.
Heist (Dir. / Writer: David Mamet) A criminally underrated, overlooked and near forgotten masterpiece with Rockwell and an ensemble cast of character actor Titans weaving movie magic with the thread of a razor sharp script and breathless blazing plot.  The GQ staffer that neglected to include this treasure should face the firing squad.
Criminal that you didn't ask him to talk about his role in JoJo Rabbit. If ever there was an iconic role ey. X
I got him to sign my copy of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles when I met him... the look he gave me 😂😂
Looove this guy
Oddly my favorite Sam Rockwell movie is not listed.  I loved how he was able to portray compassion in an authentic way in the movie The Way Way Back.  I think it is much harder to do than people realize.
I'm distraught the way way back isnt on here
Only a passing mention of Welcome To Collinwood??? I love that film and his performance was magical.
He’s so so so underrated class
I know he probably doesn’t care about it but I would’ve liked to have heard him touch on his small role in Ninja Turtles (1990) and what he thought of it.
Justin Hammer was perfect!!
Three billboards and seven psychopaths would’ve never worked without him!!
You start with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles...
fist!??!?!?!!!1
My favorite film is The Way Way Back and he is absolutely brilliant in that one. Underrated gem if you havent seen
I have nothing special to say, I just love this guy
Not asking about Jojo rabbit is a disgrace
Forgot the most iconic one:  *Regular… or Menthol?*
This guy...this guy acts.
Love the actor talent but I hope ya get hip problems
Sam steals every scene he's in. what a monster. Surprised you didnt have JoJo Rabbit here tho.
Before I watch, I hope to see moon & seven psychopaths
A world-class actor. I wish they included The Way, Way Back as his character was a loving homage to Bill Murray's Tripper in Meatballs.
Was literally watching "The Green Mile" last night. I love Sam Rockwell, he's always been one of those actors I've loved seeing, and I'm glad to see others here agreeing with me.
Argylle is extremely bad. Dont go watch it. Sams great though
His opening as a villain in CA has always stuck with me. Iconic as a villain opening for me for some reason aha
I don't see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on here 😤
I'm so glad they talked about Charlie's Angels because that movie has been one of my absolute favorites ever since I was a kid. Sam was great in it as Eric Knox!
Love him!!! 1st time I seen Sam Rockwell was in Strictly Business & I've been a fan every since...great actor ❤️
Matchstick Men should’ve been on here. Underrated film.
The truth about Sam is that well, he rocks.
how is jojo rabbit not on here?? one of rockwell’s most iconic roles in my opinion
Love Sam in The Way, Way Back. I wish he would have talked about that movie.
As someone's name who is Aidan, when I was watching Argylle and they kept saying my name I kept trying to tell them I knew as much as they did. I was just an audience member  Cool though to see my actual life in a movie. (I'm also Sam Rockwell)
Why couldn’t they break down his role in TMNT 1990?
No Jojo Rabbit
A true talent.
What a gem. Thanks for everything, Sam.
Cool nod to Enrico at 10:01
WTF is he wearing?
I browsed the sections on the video and I am really saddened The Way Way Back isn't in there. That was one of my personal favorite and overlooked roles he did.
“Stop eating my sesame cake!” -Captain Wanta
Since I saw the Green Mile, he's been in my radar. :D Amazing actor, amazing.
Would love to see him back as Justin Hammer
Amazing actor, green mile & moon are among my favourites
Guuuy
I loved his character in The Way Way Back.
worst actor in hollywood
Boo, we needed some Ninja Turtles stories
He was incredible in 7 psychopaths
Justin Hammer looks ROUGH after incarceration. He’ll clean up in time for Armor Wars to click his heels & dance his way back into our hearts❤️ 🕺
San Francisco’s finest 🙌
They need to redo Moon without Kevin Spacey’s voice. I’d watch that movie then.
I like Sam Rockwell
Moon was one of my favorite movies of all time, incredible movie, he played that role so well, and it was a treat to see him cloned infinitely lol.  what a great script.
Not having, the way way back, and assassination of Jesse James is criminal, 2 of his best movies
No Jo Jo Rabbit? That’s criminal.
Awesome actor, every role has a minium of quality  (and a dancing scene LOL). I can't but make parallelism with the great Gary Oldman, even physically I see some resemblance.
Fosse/Verdon was a sublime piece of television. 🎉
Sam Rockwell was always and underrated actor to a degree with me is just that sometimes the movie he is in are hit or miss with me. His performances sometimes are hit or miss but he deserved his Oscar a few years back
Great rolls! One that stands out for me is The Way Way Back.
Why haven’t ya got JK Simmons on here yet ??!!!
Sam is a great actor. In my opinion, he usually outshines the others in the film.
I like Justin Hammer's dancing,it was cool.
Sam Rockwell always delivers an outstanding performance.
I've seen all the movies and didn't connect the dots these were all Sam, a master at his craft
Watch “the way way back” brilliant little film with Sam its great
Most underrated actor ever lol
He'll always be Guy Fleegman to me. "IS THERE AIR?! YOU DON'T KNOW!"
Literally nobody elevates a film with their presence as much as Sam one of the greatest of all time
Confessions is one of my favorite movies and I believe Chuck absolutely was a spy
One of the most underrated, versatile actors along with Paul Dano. How is he so charming but also a bit unhinged?
He’s an Oscar winning actor, yet he’s still underrated. I don’t know how that’s possible…
The best president of the galaxy we ever had
Missing out his great performance in 1990s TMNT 😉
One of the best actors working today. HIGLY underrated (despite the oscar).  His performance in Moon is one of the best roles ever
Loved him in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,  bummed that that film was not included in the list
One of the most underrated actors. Ever.
He deserved an Oscar for Billy in Seven Psychopaths (the movie deserved a Best Original Screenplay award too). His telling of the graveyard shootout scene when he, Colin and Chris Walken were camping out in the desert was phenomenal.  FOCKIN MOWED DOWN!
Matchstick Men
I really appreciate it to hear actors like Sam Rockwell so involved in the writing process and the character they play in. Really tries to be someone else despite the looks
I would love a mini series of Galaxy Quest. One of my favourite comedic roles he has done.
He's great in everything, and I especially enjoyed his performance in Matchstick Men.
Simon Pegg producing a Galaxy Quest series?!  I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE IN!  MAKE IT SO!
*Sam Rockwell & William H. Macy are easily 2 of the best supporting actors of all time.*
Oh, I love The Winning Season! It's very funny and heartwarming.
Garbage video. No discussion of Gentlemen Broncos.
I really like Sam Rockwell's acting, and have seen most of the films he's been in.  I would have liked to have heard his thoughts on 'Jo Jo Rabbit'.
SAM ROCKWELL - One of the greatest screen actors of our time. Every film where he's the lead, play a main character or even secondary -  it just elevates the film entirely.
He's For Real! 🌟🏆
dude didnt age in 25 years
His performance in galaxy quest is one of the best comedic roles ive ever seen.
Best actor of his generation. Fearless, cool and supremely talented
First time I saw him was Wild Bill in The Green Mile. A great performance that I never forgot. His British accent in See How They Run is also brilliant.
Where’s the bad guys?
Awesome actor and constantly underrated. Moon is a true gem of a movie.
i'm like 128, what about you? One like closer to number 1.
The search for one-eyed Jimmy is legendary.
Argyle was garbage.
Sam...rocks well...?
Is it so hard to do these in chronological order
I fell in love with his acting immediately when he said "episode 87 I died in episode 87" he basically stole every single scene he was in in Galaxy Quest.i look forward to seeing him fight dance in his movies
I got a feeling he’ll be playing Justin Hammer again he did come back for what if season 2
I remember yesterday me and my friend we were drunk & we slaughtered a  goat 🐐  and roasted it but when I woke up today the goat is still alive and our dog is missing 😭
Too bad no mention of Victor Salva's Clownhouse.
He looks like Edward Norton without his beard 🧔‍♀️!
We know he Rockwell, but he Funkbetter
Sam Rockwell was going to Pixar Animation Studio, Sam Rockwell wants to perform Fantastic Beasts and Sam Rockwell is gonna be in PAW Patrol: The Third Movie
Third
I wanna be a YouTube star !

Let’s goooooo
Yayyyyy
