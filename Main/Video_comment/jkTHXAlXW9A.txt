bros jersey number is his age😭😭😭😭😭
Duke I'm apart of the 1987777777777 group to bro, "old as hell". From one old nigga to another you better get yo ass out there and practice with Tyreke, I know it's not a real NFL opportunity but that's an experience you only get once and Tyreke is the same age as well and he still moves like he's in college. Maybe that content will lead into Destroying realm and you can have fresh new content with your own twist or you and Davo could join a 70n7 team for a day.
duke moving like he 22
Cool sneakers.  I dreamed of such, but I do not have the opportunity to purchase them.  Kansas City is just great.
Fanum got on that Dominican ass outfit 😂😂 jeans and cleats is crazy

It's amazing to see people amazed most of the time it involves money and the motivational speakers tell the smart people to say use your head and you go start using it in every possible combination possible way just like the smartest top IQ above 5000.. can you just do whatever you want? Are you that capable? How do you know even the universe is infinite for sure? Can you prove that? Or are you just like some story tellers only interested in worldly desires? You landed on moon and played golf and came back and somehow forgot how to do it. Is your brain really ok? Dinosaurs and cows?.. you sure you aint just messing around living like your in a drama? One life live it up cuz you got 1 life and you won't get it twice? Who told you that? Where are the human brain calculators? What are the odds? 100%? You sure you're fine dying in the state you are at now? Authority? Power? Influence? Where were those when you were a baby? Hi you tube my name is whatever looser
Duke u shoulda hmu I texted one of y’all when y’all was in the city. Kc coo not a lot to do but there stuff to do😂 u need someone from the city to show u around

Love from KC🤞🏾
Practicing with Tyreek and the team would be FIRE. Definitely set that up
I feel like that was Tyreek Hill casually saying, "Come pull up on me & the team in the city. Dont trip either I got you tickets to any game & you can come back to the locker room & come warm up with us on the field before the game. Or come check out one of our practices & practice with us" 💯 -Shiiit, thats what i interpreted from that quick interaction between you two lol. 😂👌🏻
YOU GOTTA COME TO ST.LOUIS MO

Lowkey he saved that girl cause that eagles fan was thirsty af stalking her. She probably left the hotel bar to go to her room and had to make it obvious that she wasn't interested. Now, she's got the eagles dude on someone else's camera. Thats why that dude was standing around awkwardly after she got in the elevator. Smart woman fr but I don't think Duke realized cause he's Duke Dennis lol
Random ahhh weird ahh lady 😂
Wearing the cleats in hotel lobby is crazy 😂

Duke Denzel Dennies. Could have been the #1 overall draft pick back in 2017. Instead, he took his talents to Rizz University and took classes in Global Stepping in Super Physiques where he learned to develop his secret silent Rizz technique which many around the world try to copy but no one can match. As for his degree in Super Physiques, he uses this degree still to this day to drop off content creators in all sports and physical challenges and is carrying the DEE BLOCK legacy worldwide with his Global Stepping Degree. All around Duke Denzel Dennies, you and Davo Migo Gang Migo Gang In The Building are showing thousands of little dirtball steppers that there is more to life than the Block, continue to grind shine and prosper God Bless
Duke I say you try to work out with the dolphins it would be cool seeing you in the nfl but you almost getting close to 30 and ion think you wouldn't take it over youtube but would be fun tho

He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. John 3:36  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans‬ ‭6‬:‭23 Jesus Christ is the only way, seek Him while He may be found, before it’s too late, tomorrow is never promised.
