Too dark? Might there be an overlap of baby pictures and food pictures on Instagram?
I was banned for telling a joke. I posted the Joke Why do girls wear makeup and perfume? Cause their ugly and they stink. Just a stupid joke that I thought was funny and harmless but not to Facebook and their Nazi Censorshiping. I hope the people take a stand on this kind of censorship,it has to stop,its already getting out of control. These corporations are deciding what is right and wrong,I should be able to say or post whatever the hell I want,bad or good,ourfreedoms going away fast people.
It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.
Notice how the media is trying to convince you monopolies dont need to be broken up. Notice also how they dont tell you only 4 corperations own all media in the U.S. that number is down from over 100 in the 1980s.
how is censorship ok ? because a big company decided who is right.
Ok so let me get this straight this is the reason I am not for Republicans so QANON is very popular on there list meanwhile they will ignore KKK white nationalist NEO NAZIS because to them this is not important but conspiracies are more important
What da #### Trev 😳 are we on planet earth, it's taken this long to figure things out 😵 Arrrrh...  Shameful you onion,s... Who's hiding what, onions make more sense than trump 😳.
Big tech Monopolies are closing smaller businesses. Which is hunger and death
I agree, Amazon is too powerful!  What I hate most is Amazon Prime. You could buy a movie or show, you can't download your own copy for your PC/other device, and Amazon could take the movie or show out of your library whenever they feel like it. So it's wasting money that no one can afford to waste! I HATE being at Amazon's whims like that when I PAID THEM for good service. At least iTunes lets you have your own copy for just in case.
We got banned forever from facebook because we were  reported by Qanon for an Event where we mentioned QAnon to critique it.
😅 😂 🤣😅 😂 🤣😅 😂 🤣..freaky shit!!..😅 😂 🤣😅 😂 🤣
That instagram rule is only making the "social" media problem greater. People get an unrealistic view of the world where everybody is perfect and loved and then in their real life they notice that it's not like that and they feel left out.
If Trump is elected... They will broken up... They have persecuted Republicans and those against socialist ideologies... Hitler was a progressive...
They should do more breaking up more often big example is the FDA LOL about they  get broken up for a change maybe life will improve LOL
We all know Qanon is Steve Bannon, Bill O'Reilly, or Sarah Huckabee Sanders
Simpsons prediction
those are some sexy onions
It's like when tumblr implemented it's nsfw ban and kept flagging posts of bread and such as explicit 😂
Instagram will hide negative comments? How will they block sarcasm?
Look to Taiwan
😷
I don't care about facebook being too big. I would rather have the us wifi selection be overhauled give us more than one option. Everyone hates comcast and time warner!
That was hilarious!!! Greetings from the land of 🧅🧅🧅
Companies won't be broken up so long as their cash flows into the government.
The problem with using people ti review those flagged posts 1. quantity 2. People have been doing that and it causes trauma over time.  Maybe just accept that sometimes onions are sexy and maybe have further review upon an appeal with a reasonable claim like "It's only onions man"
I just love how the folks who cry "FAKE NEWS" believe everything they see from an unverified source on the dark web. ADORABLE! "Pizza-Gate Princess" Pop-Punk song (FUNNY) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T99VY3Vx9sA
watch Q anon be true😂😂
5:38 MY GUY
The next step after Q and on is Fox News. It is obvious that crowd should be shut down
Onion 🧅 booty 🍑 will make cry 😢 Trevor lol 😂
Call it what it is, Censorship. The exact opposite of the 1st Amendment. Goes to show exactly how what they think of your Rights.
I think twitter shall rename its self N.S.D.A.P. DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION
Did anyone realise *Facebook & Instagram* is owned by *Zuckerpunk ?*
lmao butts i like butts i'm a normal man. onions really looking good huh lol
what about Microsoft
16 months and 8 years too late
"No one would think an onion is sexy" Shrek fans: "ha ha . . . ha yeah . . . no one"
So we’re gonna forget about jeffrey epstein? Adrenochrome is real. fact is stranger than fiction
Who decides what qualifies as a negative comment?  What happened to freedom of speech?
You’re full of it , Trevor. People don’t like using these big tech companies, we simply have no viable alternatives. That’s why things are so expensive and quality is so low.
😷
I agree, little too late about Qanon. Should have banned them from the start. Dang it, FB!
We must protect free speech especially when we disagree with it. We are heading towards a bad Pandora if we accept this
Simple fact is sex trafficking isn't without leadership. Someone/group  respected, influential, and an extensive network has to coordinate an industry amassing over $150 billion per year.  No one let's that freely flow without an attempt to control such wealth.  Alphabet (owner to Google and Youtube)top 5 largest companies in the world makes $130 billion a year. That Epstein, ties to Royalty, politicians, influential people, uncovered lies of association, island visitors, private jet meetings. Cosby, R Kelley, Weinstein, not one, but accuser after accuser after accuser, showing a pattern that, had to be known and kept hidden in their group.  Turns out, sex trafficking is a high demand service, and that more people than we can imagine are taking part buying and selling.
Instagram: we're gonna start hiding mean comments! Me: 💞✨💞 but how's that gonna work ✨💞🌼✨with fairy comments 🌈✨😘💞
Trevor is so handsome 😊
I believe Steven Colbert said it best when he compared corporations (AT&T in Colbert's case) to the T1000 terminator.  You can break them up, but they always find a way to come back together.
Second time I saw this, you made me laugh out loud. That's rather rare these days.    Thanks.
I wish Facebook would have a way to "dislike" a photo or comment.
Some asshole.  Why isnt the government doing something about the tech companies!  Same asshole.  Government's trying to get our privacy from our tech!
next is Disney
Slowly the internet is eliminating all posibility of dissent in the name of fighting misinformation and bullying (which are of course noble causes), these companies are monopolies, ideologically and geographically homogenous (for example not all countries have the same moral repulsion against nudity/sexuality, but the whole world needs to suffer that if using American social media). This will only get worse in the years to come, there are barely any new social media platforms that have had the power of Google/Twitter/Facebook in the last 20 years, soon Youtube will disable thumbs downs, unpopular comments are already hidden by voting (Top comments being default), all social media algorithms already only show you stuff you agree with. We are creating echo chambers in the most advanced time of communication and sharing
You also need to address that You can basically tak shit to Asians and if reported than Instagram doesn’t do anything about it. Asian racism is an issue on Instagram and Instagram doesn’t take actions against it
While we are on it we should break up walmart and other super giants companies that are just sucking up all apportunities from smaller businesses.
especially Facebook ....
Too little too late.
I never thought I would see the day where unions would be sexy.
nahh they will make a comeback as QQanon, which honestly fits way better ,-)
I m asif chand pakistani all vedo sha
I find it silly that these dumbasses are going after Tech companies and not even batting an eye at companies like Disney, Comcast, Viacom or AT&T. You know, the real monopoly megacorps that you cannot avoid.  No lets focus on a search engine, a social network, a phone maker and a online retailer. What a joke.
Let’s be honest Instagram is only hiding comments because it helps with advertising
I agree with the stories at IG. Whenever that happens I just swipe left to skip the whole thing.
Good step @ Facebook.  Now ban every fake account on all the advertise sides. (Facebook/instagram) Ban flatearth-society. Ban Donald J Trump and every other celebrity speaking out against facemasks.  would be at least a start and you would raise the average IQ of your platform-user by 50%
No one at Facebook is eating babies 🙄 lizards eat eggs.
murphy's law. Everything that will go wrong can go wrong. LOLs.
Great instagram is giving scams more room to hide.  It's already hard to track down dyers that are months late on orders
Qanon isn't half wrong yo There is definitely a pedo elite out there making moves
Why is Qanon bad? I don't get it. Corrupt politicians are the ones who are bad. Qanon is fighting the corrupt politicians.... So, no, Qanon isn't a had thing. Qanon is good. Qanon will mobilize people against the corrupt politicians. That's a good thing!
i will tell you folks there making this virus a joke , they lay back a little bit . then let us put our advertisement right on the masks . how genius to make a fake disease put people out of work , so they can get rich off of it .
I love your show, honesty is needed. God bless you. Keep sharing and telling the truth.
censor is bad in any form
Trevors jokes gettin lamer every day he stuck at home :/
The Daily Show should be split into two. One that parodies Carona/Trump and the other that parodies everything else. Every other comedy show should follow suit.
Ban Qanon good. But what if they return. Qanon or the next Identified hate group. How can we end it the radical hate.
7:30 so true very true
Sexy onions???
Umm yes people can smile with their eyes, it is called Smize, thank you, Tyra
You kids maybe don't remember when the internet was more decentralized and censorship free. Thanks God Blockchain is bringing this back again.  Trevor Noah only do what their bosses tell him to do. In other words, he is just a bitch. You are using free speech to talk against free speech, when COMING FROM A COUNTRY WHERE FREE SPEECH WAS ALMOST A LUXURY, and you're talking against it now? You should be ashamed of yourself. You have sold yourself for some money and fame.  How about if your show gets cut off just because we don't believe on what you are saying? Would you like that? It's the same shit. What a traitor you are, and I cannot believe how ignorant is the people not to notice his BS.
the only reason why Facebook blocked Qanon is bcoz China told it to do so.  China loves blocking things, so that they can control social media in America and makes JB the next president!!
😷
Funny how Q conspiracies are never about people in the Republican party
It’s ironic that the people who are arrested and convicted of child sex trafficking are friends with the republicans like fearless leader tRump. But they blame the democrats
I'm a terrorist now . I'm not even American. I knew  QAnon will destroy all the good work of Anonymous Anons and other activists groups out there that stand up for weak.. Thank you Qanons not.  My 15 yrs old Facebook account disabled. I never vote or support any political party.
Yeah, I'm walking around pointing at people with my tongue under the mask, it's hilarious! 😂
Lmao the bit about the mask has me rolling because I do the same thing😂
Great now people with think I'm a Qanon nut cause they haven't verified my ID since MARCH!
The idea that competing companies represent a monopoly is incredibly stupid.
Big monopolies?!? NOW THEY REALIZE THAT?!?
Not sure why but your mic sounds muffled, Trevor. Might wanna look into that. BTW Love the show!
I loved the old/original Facebook - yeah, the one where you reunited with family and friends but didn't get sucked into their world and weren't being monitored and tracked and suggested options to death.
FB has ppl who recheck posts and they are as smart as the algorythm. And even if you are right and they say sorry, they still dont delete the negative entry for your page, sou you get worse reach, and they give you a coupon to pay for adds so you get your reach back.
Q is full of mental yards. But, let's be honest, j Epstein was found out to do all of that with the mega rich. Let's not forget that.
Man, if only there had been a way to monitor these companies, you know? As they grew we could maybe even, and hear me out here I know it's crazy talk but..., we could even set thresholds for a review. Well, we'd need a Congress that isn't owned by the companies they're supposed to be overseeing first I think. That could be tricky since every election they flood the airwaves with a bunch of bullshit and lies until they get elected, then it's right back to orally servicing their donors.  Gosh, how weird would it be to get folks who understand things like the internet, IOT, tech in general, and science? WE WOULD ALL DIE!!!! (or so they'd say at least. Fear is useful for controlling a populace.)
Bullying is one thing but where we supposed to draw the line on negative comments
Lolz love who you love algorithms lolz trevor
Will Instagram also censor feminists. I mean like Facebook did with men are trash
I mean come on after Jeffrey Epstein and harvey weinstein (both Democrats) what can you expect. People have lost trust
To be honest, I didn't know what Quanon is..
Could ,would ,Maybe game, america?
Break them all up!
So when are u gonna take a haircut dude hairs too long and messy
What if Qanon is right
Think globally act locally, a corner store, community run Amazon that all the local people deliver their orders who then get them! Money stays in the community and all. See, you need to divide them onto really small pieces, there are possibility of more than two options. In a mall you'd be horrified to given 1 to 2 options!  In extreme politics the 2 are enough diversity of selection?
Hi Trevor, warn Kamala about white people,  Im from the South, 1949, I KNOW! Also She has the Bx's Vote.
The only thing that woulda made this show funnier, would be for Trevor to be biting into an onion when the "mask" is removed. 😉
Lmao the ending about freaky shit under the mask ahaha that’s so me
too little too late? somehow when fucked up brains get infested by corrosive idears, propaganda and lies, i doubt they would get any better when you take away their sugar aslong they still have a medium at hand which gives them their sugar any other way still. Not like their algorythems aren't aimed to give the delusional addict what he craves.  You cut of one head and two more shall rise ^^
MEANWHILE Trumpo's tax returns show business scams for decades
#BreakUpBigTechNow
Thanks for that... amazon is a crappie of company's, Google is disgusting  and misleading most have bad information, Facebook is gossip....for people dont have a life.....Instagram  have racism and bulling....I hope they do something....
No sexy onions LMAO
As someone who grew up watching Naruto, I can tell when someone is smiling behind the mask.
Hiding negative comments is dumb.  That said, nice that qanon is gone
Yup I’ve been on time out for tweeting that Trump is being a covid liar. I was suspended for a month. No threats no cussing and boom
the smiley is licking the mask plus Disney wont allow any breakups o.o
😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷🤧

Great, Instagram comments are now going to be full of sarcasm... Isn't that fantastic?
√ This is happening \__/  MAGA is in DEBT under Republicans $27 Trillion and counting:    \__/ Total public debt is expected to nearly equal the size of the economy this year and to exceed it next year for the first time since the 1940s. The CBO predicts that the public debt will surpass the previous record set in 1946—106 percent of GDP—by 2023      & The corporate cuts are permanent, while the individual changes expire at the end of 2025.
Follow the money
But we can have acab groups sounds liget
1:48 Trevor, please, dude, I just started watching you again. These kinds of takes are just utterly ridiculous in this climate. Let's let the big tech companies continue to exploit their workers and hold undue political power too. All these companies, not just in the tech industry, just be broken up. That is the only way for people to take back the country. Why don't you leave the economic news to people who know what they are talking about and just get back to stuff about covid and trump.
How sad and stupid is your life that you believe in Qanon?
This is a distraction. Trump is stealing the election. Free State of Jones.... watch the movie and it shows truth on voting polls. Trump can still pull off a "Gus" even if we vote.  Check out Bill Maher's new rules show about Gus to see. Somebody needs to stop him from pulling that off. We are in the fight for our country now.  By the way, who is watching the poll watchers?
I dont believe  Facebook is doing all they say they're doing  iam a Facebook  user and I don't  see any  of  what they are saying
QAnon started the conspiracy about Obama and Hillary eating babies and the bullshit called “Pizzagate” yet it backfired because a lot of kids in concentration camps under ICE mysteriously disappeared and people started blaming Trump and ICE.   Karma is a bitch 😂
good job Facebook !
sonegating  is the target,  break them in to small shops.
Ahhh the American Way!  Invent a good thing and then exploit it to death! 🙌
Yet no one is worried about Disney.
Qanon can't be real because they even said that some guy name Jon was a child you know what and they always give to their children you know what buddies.
Trevor is my personal legend
Facebook became a vulgar place for idiotice 🤣😂😅
Why you got your name imposed on the video three times at all times ...
A mask emoji?! Yeah like an emoji can get sick or be contagious?! Wake up People!
Masks are nice bc they do hide your expression so it seems ppl are nicer with a “humble fan” (2 points if you get the reference lol)
Hey Trevor, why don't you stop bad mouthing our president, you are not funny at all. Actually you are a joke. i can.t stand to hear your voice or look at your ugly face.
666 dislikes. How appropriate
That last comment about potential expressions going on under masks and the final cut away left me giggling to myself.  Great way to start my day.
This is an echo to Andrew Yang's campaign.
The first moon landing wasn't faked, only the second one was!  They overshot and landed on mars then placed a filter over the pictures to make it look the color of the moon!
Stop censorship!
Vote early! Vote Biden/Harris
TRUMP - 2020 !!!!!!!!!!!
And yet,  photos I reported from someone who continually posted images of those hurt and killed in kenosha, was not against Facebook's rules
U just rewarded a precedent for more censorship. After they finish with the right they will turn to the left which is the real target because the left actually threatens the powerful
Is people smiling behind the mask? Well, isn't it MUCH BETTER? NOT to be smiling at all times, whenever you just want to be with a resting bitch face.
Sure ,ban one propaganda group who support republicans and forget about the propaganda groups of Dems. This cancel culture needs to be stopped! Atleast don't have double standards when banning stuff
You make my day 💕
Although I cannot stand those Q-tips,  freedom of speech is STILL FREE SPEECH!! Facebook cherry picks who can post and who gets banned for life! 2020 CANNOT suck any harder.....   Can it?
1:02 "From Norwegian" ... Norwegian is a language, Norway is the country.
I learned how you say qanon
They broke up Standard Oil and turned it into for other companies that was still controlled by the main one so are we still going to have that when we have corporate interlocks that still control these companies and we just gave them a bigger platform to work from. Yeah we have to learn from our past and figure out how to really break these monopolies which is allowing smaller businesses to flourish bye stopping the FCC from getting rid of net neutrality and allowing more commercial space for these smaller companies to grow and compete
Trevor and Facebook covering up for the pedophiles that are eating the babies!
😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷
Does this mean internet will be unmonopolized like WiFi connection internet broadband whatever lol
I'm so high right now
Breaking News:  Western Freedom of the press (Julian Assange ) & us freedom of speech are Rumor
I there are still a lot of people suffering from different health issues and are therefore looking for solution. I bring you Good news. There is a man called Dr UROMI a herbal practitioner who helped cure me from Genital herpes and shingles, this i had suffered from for the past 2 years and i have spent so much money trying to survive from it. I got my healing by taking the herbal medicine he sent to me to drink for about 14 days . 14 days after completion of the dosage, I went for a medical checkup and I was tested Genital Herpes NEGATIVE. I’m sharing this so that other people can know of this great healer called Dr UROMI because I got to know him through a friend he cured from too. I was made to understand that he can cure several other deadly diseases and infections. Don’t die in ignorance and don’t let that illness take your life. Contact Dr UROMI through his email. Druromiherbalhome@gmail.com or whatsApp +2349021374574
What a stupid thing to ban.  Let people have their conspiracy theories- who cares?  What they should have done is banned publicly sharing anything political.  Get people talking directly to their friends instead of spreading hate and misleading quotes to strangers. Plus memes could just be funny again.
You almost sound 100, ,% like Donald Duck.
Way to go Trevor!!
They’re not bog because we like to use them. They’re big because of capitalism, tax breaks and intensive physiologically analyzed data, ads and impulses.  Did I mention tex breaks?
You shouldn't be surprised if he says "Folks, you have not seen anybody test more positive for coronavirus than me, with a possible exception for Abraham Lincoln".
*I wrote this on Facebook years ago that US companies are getting too big for the good of anyone worldwide. They need to be cut down to size.*
When they start talking about breaking up monopolies, it’s just a futile effort to sustain a crumbling capitalism. 🦸🏾‍♂️
🛑vote Biden/Harris wear a mask 🛑🛑 vote -by - mail 🥰
Nice, Trevor Noah!  Thank you for your honest reactions and bringing balance to the force!
*Youtube is getting real comfortable with these double no skip ads.*
*Instructions unclear , hand ended up in the blender.*
SEXY ONION 😂
So AI thinks onions are sexy? What about other vegetables and seafood that have more interesting,  curious shapes? LoL
That last bit was funny AH!🤣😅
...a neat gesture, hiding negative comments to stifle bullying, sure... But doesn't Twitter already do something like this? I'm pretty sure that didn't make Twitter any less of a untamed wilderness.
The daily show's corporatism is showing. Who are they owned by again?
Just a note for non Democrat voters who are currently registered as a Republican or Independent who wish to vote Democrat this year, you will have to re-register as a Democrat in order to vote Democrat this year. In most states you have 15 days to do this before election. Check into your state  to get the facts to be certain your vote will count. I know this is the case in California. Vote Blue💙
They are ignoring the fact that there are only 3 major drug stores in the world.
Censorship is increasing left and right on all platforms.
Education yourself about Technocracy!!!!
Don't understand the content Don't see the relevance That's how much they have taken away from me that I watch this bs
I'm sure that Trevor actually died by Corona and we all just see his hipnotic hoodies talking to us... 😶
You say smiling, I say high af
I honestly love these masks. I don’t have to smile at the people who come through the drive-thru and they won’t have any idea.
Thanks. Great RedPilling vid . WWG1WGA
Trevor no, 90%? give the cat photo people some more credit
Satan didn't do anything wrong
lol Republicans don't care if those companies are too big, they are doing it because they think those companies are censoring republican propaganda. What happened to "waah government overreach into the private sector!"
Apple isn't a monopoly the way the other three are. How many of their products have no viable, existing competitors?
I don't agree. Isn't this just a way for an "outside judge" to determine what is considered negative content? I know some messages are overtly hateful, true. But overall? Then will political ads that spout lies be hidden? Fundraisers by companies asking struggling households to give to other struggling souls while said companies, themselves, have enough funds to help and do not be hidden? People talking about how wise they are who immediately show themselves fools by blocking out and invalidating anyone who doesn't agree and thus limiting their own growth be hidden? No?  Then what, I ask, IS negative content?
You’re not a comedian! How do you get paid to be so horrible at your job!!!
I am definitely going to miss the daily social distancing show when this is over.
I find it funny Instagram is working hard to hide negative comments, but every time I report a fake Russian bot profile, they say "we did not remove their profile, because it did not go against our policy". 😬😬😬
Haha facebook thinks that onion is a tittle! I can kind of see a nipple there..
Are those gilded bull testicles on the shelf?
His funny face at the end🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
With a face mask, strangers think I'm 20 years younger.  Keep 'em confused!
The onion facing forward has the same geometry as a female breast. The stem bump looks like a nipple.
My mask emoji is the same as it’s always been 😷
Facebook is everything Zuck didn't know about Boomers before he invented Facebook.
The only good part about wearing a mask (other than the fact that it protects you and others from the virus) but in the winter it keeps your face warm
Maybe Facebook should just read their community rules. Every time one reports something to them they claim it is not against their rules. (Those middle eastern/northern african men claiming they are white females in another country, while FB rules state you should use your REAL name). Nowhere it is stated that onions are against the rules...  maybe it is still part of their anti-boob campaign.
I like hiding my facial expression. You don’t want to feel my feelings.
Sex is wholesome and good. Violence is not.
The smiley look like a happy Chinese Grampa
So if someone critises injustice or lies, will that comment also be hidden?
"freedom of speech"
😷
So war and GENOCIDE in Armenia aren't relevant enough for this show? Silence makes you complicit. The media needs to give this coverage. Michael B Jordan said it best  https://twitter.com/michaelb4jordan/status/1314392599084462080?s=20
Thank YOU EPIC GAMES for pushing the investigations on Apple and similar companies and calling out their Monopoly.  Who would think the creators of Fortnite would fight so hard people people's right.
These idiots at FB are now doing this as though they didn't know all these while. Its pathetic.
So i assume they are going to break up big oil companies as well?
Onions will put a rash on your crotch lol that's why Google thought that's what you wanted to search
😷
Look up Anneke Lucas a former child sex slave to the rich and politicians. Her testimony will blow your mind. And if it doesn't leave you convinced you are in denial.
Onions...when you know you've been alone at home too long...
Seriously, they need to stop all this crap with Google.  It's a giant because it's the best.  I'm gonna be ticked off if they change something on there & it's not as good because of all the other stupid searches that aren't as good & are jealous of Google's success.
Q is 🍊trump’s 🍄 trigger
Some Americans are willing to say anything to justify any action—violence, insurrection, even treason—to defeat their perceived enemies. The media....keep talking about conspiracy theories as if they were a “collective delusion.” They are no such thing. The authoritarians who espouse them don’t care if QAnon is true. They don’t care that it’s false. Conspiracy theories are a *convenience* , a means of rationalizing what they already want to do, which is precisely what the media does  not report.
Setting Facebook aside (FB does not provide a service that cannot easily be replaced), the monopoly power of The Big Three is very challenging as there IS benefit to the average consumer in their existence as a monopoly. “We make the most user friendly tech on the planet”, “we will deliver anything to you in two days or less” and “we give you access to the entirety of humanity’s knowledge” does not burn the Average Joe as hard as “I own the railroad so here’s your bill.” Are those monopolies scary? Yes. What is stopping Google from removing a politician from their search engine because the politician said they used Bing? Other than good will and “we won’t, we promise”, nothing...  How autocratic regimes have used Google and Facebook to stomp out dissent is not an indication of what autocracy can do, it is a testament to what Google can do.
Twitter once gave me the "hmm, perhaps you should not post this, perhaps it is racist" popup for a comment giving advice about someone's COCKROACH PROBLEM so I'm gonna assume unless it's other viewers flagging the instagram comments as negative that's not gonna work at all
These people did not spring forth from the void . They are just the a different variation of the *OLD* Christian Right, "the hyper-patriotism and the sense of embattlement, and particularly the conviction that political disagreement or progressive values must equal not sexual perversion but sexual predation. It really gained momentum in the 1970s with the New Christian Right ."
I left the room for like 20 seconds and came back to this 1:18 ??
You know it’s true  when all poplar platforms are blocking Qanon acounts. If its false information, why they are scared. Just look how youtube is warning about misinformation while in the same time, if you searched for any bad thing,  such( Isis ) , you won’t see any warning from YouTube 🤔
I'm concerned that this thin edge of the wedge. Antimedia and many other platforms larger than Qanon have disappeared off facebook in the past. One reason they become such safe space for far right conspricists is because so many other anti-corporate voices were purged already.
This show has been getting better and better. Thanks Daily Show folk!
Sexy Onions?  Not my proudest fap
The moon landing had to be fake, because we still don't have the technology to pass living things through the Van Allen Gama radiation belts. Google it
I love Trevor. He's smart, funny, and his hair is fantastic.
You stupid 😅 onion bit hahaha
Breaking them up is unfair on the face of it because they were built on capitalism. Then you tell them to stop selling products people want?
😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷
while this one doesnt believe a shit thing the Q says the mega rich are not to be trusted, and some of what they say might ring true, as far as the mega rich are concerned, since they are the only ones who can comfortably afford to make those kinds of trafficking purchases in the first place, jus like they are alot of the same people who purchase tanks and stuff on the black market, and all those other things that cost as much as  mansion but  why did it take so long to for face book to take action, and why do people listen the "Q" hell why are some people afraid of melanin? whats the point of the comment you might ask this one is just bored
This guy is so lame and a waste of TV time, why doesn't he try and run this country himself and see how easy it is.
I agree Trevor… I get anxiety when I see a whole bunch of dashes for somebody’s story😳😆 I’m only sticking around for the first 2, maybe 3 but that’s it!🤣🤣🤣
you're looking very sexy with that hair and beard
Time for a good old fashioned trust bustin.
Has America become commie............. What has become of free markets?
What about breaking up Disney lol
I wish Instagram would stop censoring fat ppl and letting skinny ppl have their whole twats out....but yea its nice to censor negative emotions
Not funny and an idiot on top of it.
I dont think the motherFckr caught the virus. You didnt see or hear a single cough. No sign of breathing problems. Hes lying so he can get away from the debate or extend it pass election date.
LOL I can definitely see why they changed the mask emoji. It looks like an Asian person

If you like Predator catches check out @predatorcathers just add a city name after the “predator catchers “ help them by “like” and sharing
Trevor, we know that you clean up really well. Its not Movember yet.
This needs to apply to pharmaceutical companies as well, or is that asking to much? It's not like peoples lives will be financially or psychologically effected.
😷
Break them up.
Trevor needs to be using that black accents more often😂😂😂
😷
This is a dangerous show. He tries to play the middle, but leans towards corporate interests and his jokes are always focused on discrediting any opposition to the status quo.
Ok, what the heck is ma' bell I've been seeing it in the comments a lot and y was it broke up??
Facebook bans Qanon:Now watch Qanaon believers use that as more proof that its real and there trying to cover it up by censoring it LOL!
QAnon is Banned? so no more objective infos?
Ewwe No! "Install a ceiling fan" - "when you have a rash on your crotch?"  LOL, ROTFL and replayed it.
So basically what we have here is a racist privileged black man in his ivory tower telling all the peasants to keep quite while BLM and other terrorist organizations burn your house down got it
This guy is such a corporate shill, pumping out Democrats talking point. Not even a pale shadow of John Stewart. Pathetic...
I don't follow qanon but silencing them IS silencing free speech. But not a word on all the left wing craziness and insanity. The Nazis silenced free speech also. Iran, China and North Korea do the same things. Liberals = insanity.
Fuc.... onion!
Shut down the  Facebook Apple Amazon Google  Back in the closet for the technocrats.
This could become a major problem. Where do those of us who are potential child traffickng satanist , paedophiles (who only occasionally like to eat children) go to meet like minded people? And where WILL I buy my shampoo?
Break them it’s crazy.  They are brain washing stupid people to cults
I deeply miss JS this dude is straight shill
I Agree with Quanon on the Pedophiles/Sexual molestation/Harassment in Hollywood that’s not a conspiracy moreso a “Duh” Moment. It’s a technique known as Paltering. Using a Truth to expand a lie. Child stars have been saying it for years. But it’s funny how Quanon skips Pedophilia in demographics that vote with them.  Including but not limited to:  - Evangelicals & Conservative Christianity: Thousands or Cases of marrying underage girls to middle age men.  - Fox News Staff including Owner.  - Republican Politicians: (Honorable Mentions) Donald Trump, Rob Moore, John Allen Burt...I could name hundreds more.  - Law Enforcement: Joe Arpaio, More than 1000 cops have had or have Rape & Sex Trafficking Cases currently on books.  - Catholic Priest: Do I have to expound? - Disney: I won’t speak to openly about the dark lord for fear Mickey is listening.  - Pageants: the Number One source of Pedophilia was oddly left off Quanon’s Truths. I wonder why 🤔
If only FB would actually delete hateful comments that wished people would die, mock victims etc.
Soooo... the magic bullet was really magic and the Building 7 never existed?
Good move by Instagram
Did instagram hire Butters? Poor boy.
Facebook must be broken up or outrightly destroyed. It's pure trash
I Will Fight Apple If They Remove The Original 😷 Emoji.
Let’s not downplay the fact child trafficking & Epstein was exposed by hackers & not the Q-Anon Cult who steals #TedGunderson #MarkPassio & information exposed long ago & ignored.
#TedGunderson #TheFounders  #AaronRusso #MarkPassio #TheHellfireClub #JohnTodd
Removing QAnon now does nothing but reinforce it. It would be better to leave it up with some kind of counter-claim. The more important thing for Facebook (and other companies to do) is to discuss how they will detect and stop when a similar BS idea pops up in the future
What the hell...killing children?!!!!! 🤔
Two round objects near -  Algorithm : That's vulgar
But people wishing for the death of the leader of the free world is okay with Facebook...🤮
NOAH, TODAY I LOVE YOU !
Has anyone ever seen Trevor and Bruno mars in the same room at the same time? 🤔 QAnon should investigate! Lol
Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook 🤔
The economic world has been taken over by the richest and wealthiest men , abusing power and stealing from the poorest people
Yeah best to ban dangerous ideas. No need for scary stuff like that to spread.
Wow people have become so fragile now Insta has to hide negative comments. Simultaneously showing their whole lives online while protected from the things they don't want to see. ...And we wonder how Trump became president.
So why don't they also go green and ban oil and make every one go renewable energy....
Wait, moon landing is fake, right!
Such a brave normal guy...😷
The EU has been suing these schmucks for years, while Slick Willie allowed the consolidation of Financial companies and Banks. Antitrust has been the boogeyman to capitalism the last 25 years. Stupid government.
I don't like onions bc they make me cry and aha I knew it, you've left the house Trevor..."we've been walking around..." uh huhh I see you Trevor(Trevor voice)😂
They sensor and gather information to use against the public as control. Programs are used to seed ideas and sway group views on specific topic. This is putting more money and power to those controlling searches. Consumers identified for product purchases and chances of changing political agendas.
Desperate in Shenghen.... Thank you Trevor! TREVOR FOR PRESIDENT!
Ahahah the big tech, so Facebook is no longer helping you?
I hope that after quarantine Trevor keeps his fro and facial hair  - I can't imagine him any other way now
Coming up next on stage...give it up for Sexy Onion!
True trevor shitty thighs go under mask😂
dude i find it weird....but you are quite handsome with that beard and haircut....
How about we just make them pay income taxes?!
That emoji looks like it's being kidnapped
I think Trevor needs to get out of his house ! He's starting to look like an angry conspiracy theory youtuber  ! Talking about sexy onions ? WTH is happening ? I miss slick handsome Trevor ! Said with love because I'm a fan
Out of all the horrible incidents all around the world involving Facebook, "The Moon Landing" & "JFK Assassination" was the only thing your amazing Writer could come up with....????
Me: Reporting an actual fake account that has been harassing me using my photos. Facebook: It’s all cool bro. They didn’t violete community standards.  Sexy Onions: *Exists* Facebook: Hol' Up
Socialmedia platforms got popular because everyone needed to express themselves.. you cencor one of them and some other smart person will make another platform for the need and everyone will shift to that place...
Bible prophecies are happening like never before, we're in the end times. Are you saved by believing in the blood of Jesus? John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. https://youtu.be/A159GcAffpI
Moderation is like good governance. Nothing makes one appreciate good moderation like users that post about baby sacrifice conspiracies.
I love this man🤣
Sorry to say but as long as the language is respectful, no one is degraded by abuse and no phobia is spread against certain religion or race, information should not be limited or stopped. Even if it's conspiracy theories you  find ridiculous, there should be no regulation. Because the moment you start regulating such stuff on social media, invariably the regulations would affect information that is true but not popular because in the end algorithms are only as accurate as the person making them is unbiased and since human beings are rarely unbiased, we don't need more censorship.
Facebook sucks bro!!
Qanon is disgusting and twists information to create hate. I find it insane how many pot head ppl believe all the extremist stuff they post.
Hiding negative comments... sigh, creating more snowflakes and hiding reality from people even more. We're creating a generation that can't deal with different views and critical comments.
😷😷😷
Hiding comments is vile and unaccepable! Banning, suspending, removing… that's all well and good. Hiding, shadow banning… that's utterly dishonest, vile and unacceptable.
i really vibe with whatever attitude Trevor has going on today
Karma....After Facebook bullied Bytedance...
Sexy Onions, lol!
SHOW ME THE REAL UNEDITED PHALLIC ONIONS
facebook finally realized? no my dude they just cant make profit off of them anymore so they want them off of their servers
these tech companies are clearly abusing power and screwing people so hard they think its normal
6:20 BRAVE 😆 😆 😆
Facebook should learn from Instagram. I’ve reported many hateful, bullying comments on Facebook and they came back with a response that it’s NOT against their standards!  What !???  🤨😳😣 How is bullying NOT against your standards!Really shows what Low stands you have FB. Facebook is such garbage !!!!! Not to mention incessant ADDS on Facebook and Snapchat !!!!!!
I quit Facebook three years ago and I’m so happy that I don’t have to deal with their nonsense anymore.
Its a good step towards stopping misinformation. Its ruini g our economy
Good. Purge that trash from all major platforms. It will reduce its prevalence from society. We hear about Alex Jones less now, right?
6:50 Chinese introduced it first
Thanks Trevor! This was hilarious
Funny how all the crazy Q-anon people tend to be trumpers or some other extreme right wing lunatic.
You aren't even funny!!!
Why you gotta say GD on every single segment Trevor? It's offensive
Trevor Noah just gets more handsome. Also it would be good to split up Instagram and FB. That just seems like too much.
This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that breaking even just one of these commandments makes us guilty of breaking them all.   The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved .  The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27); ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ .  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117750/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_KttEFbESFBVEC
Thank you Jordan Klepper. Pro life trumpers who protest and fight to protect all life yelling at the top of their lungs in small enclosed  spaces without masks !  Huh???  You need to be consistent people.  Your big super hypocrite undies are showing🧐
Biggest tyrannical douchebag I've ever seen on social networks
7:18 a genuine smile originates from the eyes. Not many people know this, but when people are genuinely smiling, their eyes go up which pulls the corners of their mouths up. When people are giving a fake smile, the corners of the mouth go up, but the corners of the eyes do not.
man this would be terrible for consumers. imagine amazon splitting up into 5 companies now you need 5 year subscription fees to get all the services amazon gave you before so thats $600 a year
Am I the only one who would like to block Instagram Reels?
I am not sure that breaking up the big tech will do any good. When they broke up Ma Bell it made phone services worse, for a higher cost. I miss Ma Bell.  Luckily the cell phones freed from landlines anyway... But seriously it never made sense that amazon delivers products, but somehow got a tv channel, too?
Facebook can eat one or more di**. They are not worthy of being trusted, not as long they ban pictures of the Kurdish culture, flag and it's guerrilla soldiers.
Wait apple only has 20% of their market in both computer and phones.   How are they a monopol.
Child trafficking in elite circles IS real and people with money and  power do use the media to try and discredit investigations. Look at Prince Andrew and his dealings with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell; we haven't heard very much about that recently. Why hasn't that case moved forward?  And I looked at the Pizzagate guy's instagram before it was sanitized (the owner of the pizza restaurant accused of being a front for child trafficking). There were lots of oddly sexual, partially nude pictures of children on his account; it was just really weird. It wasn't artsy (coming from the fine arts, I know art photos) they were really unsettling pictures. Now, they're gone.   Some of these claims are not so outlandish. Jimmy Saville used a hospital as a cover for his child rape/molestations. "Massage Parlors" are often used as fronts for illegal prostitution and the trafficking of non-citizens. Using a pizza parlor as a front for child trafficking is not as outlandish as major news sources made it out to be. And that could very well be because some of them were implicated in those dealings.
Trevor continues his idiocy.  Go back to the U.K. Trev.
Insta will now crack down o comments that will say "You are the GOAT"
😹
mask moji is a copycat of wechat
I really hope these people no lying to the people for money is selling you're soul and you will be first to pay for the crimes you committed all so you can be rich.
Long live the Illuminati! !!
Hahaha we've known that so called freedom of speech on Facebook or Twitter is a JOKE!
Mark so ugly
When are they going to ban this show?
Getting a human to replace the machine learning algorithm that Facebook uses will need the all 7 billion individuals on earth because they have tons of data so the number of humans on earth is not enough to process all these data
Trump said he has never heard of the Proud guys, Davie Duke, Q Anon, or the LGBTQ Anon as he lay in bed eating fried chicken from a GOLDEN CHAMPAGNE BUCKET. The Trump family asks that you respect their privacy while Donald gets over the flu.
This video started a fight between me and my step-brother who is a Q-Anon supporter.
I cannot even watch your b.s. anymore.
Trust 17
Fb needs to breakaway from instagram now
Interesting a country that doesn’t believe in socialization but would have government break up companies that grew because of their capitalist system. #Confused
😳🤣🤣😂😊🤓🌷💕
I wonder how QAnon feels about Trump consuming an antibody concoction made with the help of aborted fetuses in front of the entire nation and then proclaiming "I haven't felt this good in 20 years."
“When you rip out a man’s tongue, you do not prove him wrong, only that you are afraid of what he might say.”
Lets not forget that trump owes over 400 million $ to someone out there.
Thing is Chrisopher Columbus was not the first person who discovered the American continent. Where do you think the first native Americans come from. If all humans a descendents from Adam and Ever or Allice from the African Continants then how did the native American come to be on the continent known as America now to latter become the indiginouse people. Native Americans was the first humans to discover America and inhabit the continent. Columbus it just a plagiarist who stoll the native americans creadit and work.
Let's break them up and watch them merge 3 years later. Americans are clueless as to how many companies merging in the past 10 years were broken up prior.  For exampel Google breaks up into Google 1 and Google 2 and then Google 2 acquires or merges with 10 small companies over 5 years and becomes bigger than the original Google. It's all smoke and mirrors, resulting from rapidly changing private sector landscape, and incompetent or compromised law makers.
Twitter, Facebook, Instagram might be some of the worst inventions by mankind.
The Social Network 2. Make it happen.
See my playlist
The emoji looks high asf .
BIDEN... HARRIS.  2020
But we are good with the communication monopolies
Next Facebook needs to stop giving Climate Change deniers a platform for unflagged lies.
The issue with breaking up Amazon is that they don't make money off Amazon.com, they make money on their web hosting services so they can lose money on Amazon.com to undercut everyone else and dominate commerce.  So, I mean...it's a problem if you like getting stuff cheaper on Amazon, but will be a good thing if you're getting run out of business by Amazon.  Either way, monopolies suck.
Watch the socail dilemna on netflix everyone.
Anti-trust laws have been weakened consistently for more than 90 years.  The laws worked but slowly were destroyed.
I had a Facebook friend kept posting all this crazy shit. I had not heard of QANON at that point. I Unfriended her but she believed all that nonsense.
"Google could have one company for search results, and another for suggesting what to type" Reminds me of that time I had to look up what GMOs were for a school project, and it autocompleted my search result to "What does GMO stand for weed?" on my school account 😁😁😁

🤣🤣🤣🤣 that little white onion surrounded by those big black onions
It’s a blessing that the Q-Cult has been banned. Other social media platforms should follow facebooks lead
I like that he says goddamn instead of gosh or my goodness.
Kill facebok
Without Trump, you would have no show.
for both the anti-trust and the q anon ban, it is too little too late, for sure
STOP DISTRACTING YOUR VIEWERS CAUSE THAT’s treason BTCH... There’s no conspiracy here bro it’s FACTS & YOU KNOW IT!!!
*Trump's last seven days in emojis* 🤧 Starts feeling sick 🥵 Sick feeling becomes overbearing 🤒 Gets tested for Covid-19 😷 Tests positive for Covid-19 🥴 Gets treatment for Covid-19 🥱 Leaves hospital, unimpressed by symptoms 🙄 Tells you it's like the Flu. Again.
Hi here is a hate from the onion...lol. the AI should find this. Luv the new emoji...it has eyebrows!!
Obama is a clone... Lol.... That one had me... Hahaha
Apple needs to be controlled.
***Trevor is so disconected from reality***I did not even laughed once this is so unfunny and the information is not even 50%. All relying on media makes me wonder.....how this guy has a job. Denying that there censoring on facebook and other social media is plain ignorant. YOU MITE NOT BE CENCORED WOKE TREVOR but many other more realistic journalists are.
Instagram is bum f’ing us now...We live for those negative comments
How was it with the onion? Did it burn, or was it more of a nice warm tingly sensation?
The censoring of speech has begun welcome to the end game
whos it bad for if people think hollywood is satanic ? the left are easily brainwashed
It seems to me naïve that Google is a search engine as they are NSA store front. Google employees quit and report Google Street trucks used to gather pictures for target assassinations. Boycott divert and sanction and avoid using Google.
I DOWNLOAD YOUR MILKSHAKE
But still allows the Marxist BLM & Antifa groups that are supported by the Democrats and funded by George Soros to remain.
Q'Anon- "SAVE THE BABIES!"  Same people: "Defund school lunches, preschool, after school activities, food stamps, CHIP Insurance, etc..."
Thought it said, “Ganon banned”.. I was so scared 😟
Good points all
5:07 is this why fairy comments were invented?
I would rather keep Amazon as just Amazon and Google as just Google. Idc if they have a monopoly. They work great and makes my life easy
Yep, too little too late.
I personally just find it ironic that platforms decide to ban a conspiracy, but you can STILL find rape videos on PornHub..... their lack of prioritization speaks A lot.
I love Trevor’s discussions with Trevor.
Kkkkkk  l like the part 😃
Instead  Of splitting them up because they're a monopoly  company maybe we should make them pay taxes.wow  Problem solved
Trevor: "No human would think an onion is sexy." Me: *remembering the old onionbooty website*
You're a national treasure, Mr. Noah. Much love!!! <3 <3 <3
So they can make a new mask emoji in less than a year, but they still haven’t finished the transgender flag.
We are sooo late on reining in big tech
LOL I just ordered Dove shampoo on Amazon today, and yep, I made sure the shipping was prime.
We use them because of the lack of competition
onions are sexy
Cool. QAnon is stupid.
This guy is hilarious
You really funny 😂
Hello my dear how are you doing?  I watch your video and news everyday
We loved the phone company and they still broke it up.
Congress did NOT conclude that they need to be broken up. Companies in a monopoly/duopoly position can instead be more heavily regulated.
There's crazies on both sides.   Bad cops.   Crooked politicians.  Predator teachers.   Humans will be humans.
2 onions. Cool photo. Not sexy, funny.
Mickey Mouse Is Probably Pooping In His Pants Right Now.
Child abuse happens no matter what your political side you are on. The point is to stop that shit from happening.
good reporting.
They don’t eat babies ... just parts of their brains. Duh!
Can someone be so blind and working for evil?
Now if only Youtube got purged of those retarded conspiracy theories as well. I don't even care about free speech anymore, since people are too retarded to handle that kind of responsibility.  If you pretend to not know how harmful this platform is for retards, then look up flat earth. Flat Earthers reveal how harmful this platform is, since they are plentiful and that thing wouldn't exist without youtube. Without youtube flat earth would be the fringe of the fringe.   Furthermore retards don't like to read so they come to youtube and get indoctrinated easily, because they have no defences against even the most elementary forms of propaganda.  Evolution took a wrong turn somewhere, because we have an overflow of extremely unintelligent people amongst us and it seems the numbers are growing fast. Normally they'd be dead before adulthood, but we have it so safe that it rarely happens. They become adults and breed with other retards.  Because of those gullible asshats we now have to restrict the exchange of ideas and expression on different popular platforms.  Thank the idiots, they're ruining it for everybody.
You know what ?Cant you show me that weir that you tock please
😷??
Big Tech does creeping censorship.  They start out with things almost everyone is against, then move on to things like police watchdog groups, fossil fuel protestors, people who contradict CIA talking points against countries we have or are preparing to do coups in or invade, etc. They talk up the far-right groups they're banning and do the left groups and others mostly under the table.
😷
The Ma Bell breakup decades ago. Now there's cellphones. Qanon is ridiculous already.
WHAT ABOUT DISNEY
Why can't Eddie Van Halen Play the Guitar? -- There's six feet of dirt in the way ..
QAnon It's Telling us lies Then I gotta say enough is enough Stop conspiracies Because they're all lies .😒
This country is doomed😑😑😑😑
Ok Trevor's hair is super cute now. And I didn't think I'd like the scruffy beard look on him but he's really pulling it off. Makes him look younger.
When Facebook actually does a good thing for once
HEY Lil Brother YOU make me Proud and Laugh. 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
What's with the hair on Trevor's neck? Amazon has not been broken up as yet....thank about ordering a razor.
Love you(maybe a shorter hair??)
The ending😅 😷
too little too late for sure ...those q ppl are convinced 45 is an undercover agent that’s going to expose the trafficking...yeah cuz that’s why he supports jeff and whatever his piece of garbage wife’s name is...absolutely off their rockers...and probably in many drugs

This guy gets up my nose 👃
I wish they would ban Trevor Noah, on account of he sucks. God people on the left are pretentious and brainwashed and stupid, and the worst part is, you have no clue that you are.
The Trump campaign conspired with Russians and hired Cambridge Analytics to produce fasle negative adds (commercials) to flood social media with disinformation. Poorly educated people ate it up,, calling it "red pilled". Fools!
The most upsetting thing in this video is Trevor confusing needlepoint and knitting. 😤
It looks like the emoji is about to sneeze :)
Getting ready to watch #uncut. It's about how trump is clinically psychotic
😷😷😷
Trump dancing with Epstein for 30 years Qanon: ....  2020 Qanon: TRUMP 2020, we must fight the elite pedos
We should have been doing this on 2005
Because facebook works for the deep state
Are we really banning negative comments? It honestly is a fun way to see stupidity and get some good laughs in. Also if we ban negative comments, now people who post horrible things won’t see the backlash of their indecent posts. Now they live deeper in their isolated world.
Never in my life... I seem to say this everyday
The only people I know who watch you are my white, childless, 30-year-old, aunt and uncle
Ah Young Trevor,  I see you have yet to master the eye-smile. I refer you to Hatake Kakashi of the Naruto Anime for tips. Seriously for a guy who's whole face is covered 99.99% of the time, he's surprisingly emotive. Lol!
DEMOCRAT NETWORK ENGINEER HERE ... If you break these companies up everything from R&D, DevOps, to Cybersecurity could be compromised against foreign competitors like Huawei. United they Stand, Divided they Fall....
Qanon was telling the truth on that
I like butts too 😅😁
LOL. Trevor <3 onions. :p
brave
Qanon is a movement of GOD!! THE LORD HAS SPOKEN!!!!!!!!! Save your souls now ...............REPENT..............Go Back to GOD Qanon!! Trump 2020..............GOD WE LOVE YOU
I glad they are losing it down. People are basically lazy. If it's not easy to export of. They will walk away.
Onions have *layers*
American Women Now Vailed! Ali Akhbar..

Facebook needs to ban you too
We're still waiting for emojis with afro hair
Facebook once take down my post about a duck. It's just a white and round duck mind you. An ACTUAL duck okay?
multifarious begoggled
Never know about QANON... how about facebook ban Falun Gong too?
Complains about big tech, buys a Windows computer on the Amazon app on their iPhone, then brags about how Gates has all of the answers. Trevor please find a new job. Your show is a joke!
I thought this dude was a comedian
To quote Dorothy Zbornak do “you had me right up until the end” the conspiracies about The wealthy and celebrities abusing their money and influence to engage in horrific inhuman behavior but you lose me with the Satanic ritual part.
Social media is good for reconnect with people. Then likes, dislikes, comments  and bullshits arrived and ruin everything
Don‘t forget about Epstein and Assange!
I think is perfect that fb regulates the negative discouraging hateful words that is being promoted there. Like, "all the profanity vulgarity language too has to go. It never was the norm n shouldn't never be.
I'm ten steps ahead of everyone, lol I caught my own  misspelled word..👍 ,👊

Where is Young Chop? Did Big Pharma get him?
Im ask for breaking up big tech but how about breaking up big corporations, lobby groups and police unions.
1qqq
Like honestly a lot of rich people ARE pedophiles. It’s the whole sacrificing children thing that lost me.
Sounds like someone in the office has a rashy crotch????
Clearly you haven't had a Vidalia onion.
Nope. 1st amendment  anyone?
Never fails when you come up a great idea someone just has to come along and ruin it! That first mask emoji looks suspiciously Chinese? 🤔🤔🤔
breaking up is not the solution. Why perfectly destroy companies that bring the money in ? and destroy tech development ? no you use it to make it work for the people.
I can't help but feel like Quanon people just watched team America and took it as a documentary
😷
🧅🧅🧅🧅👀👁👅👁
Google search - How do you ...... install a ceiling fan? No Google, How do you treat a rash on your crotch ..?
My body guards will kill all QAnon followers while wearing Old timey mafia bois
"No human would think an onion is sexy." Trevor you haven't met my wife.
Anyone else noticed the south park reference, safe space
Onion booty duh! Banned.
I mean epsteins island... the rich and celeberties... take away the santanic bullshit and add all polititions and the theory has merrit
Trevor u r one of da few reasons I don't cut off my internet
Nooöoqoooö
Yes you are soo right
FB put my account in jail for 24 hours for referring to a burglar as a parasitic $cumb@g.
I love making weird expressions behind my mask and just laughing by myself in public.
Facebook's robot algorithm is also mass deleting regular people who are tripping up their software. Either that, or they are equally cracking down on anti-racist, pro-democracy messaging. Ask me about it, I've been permanently disabled since August, and there is NO human support team in place to review these decisions. Imagine posting "Richard Spencer is a white supremacist" or "everyone in Kenosha be careful there are armed white supremacists on the way" and getting removed. It's dystopian. They are cutting off people from their friends, family, communities, and business pages during a PANDEMIC. Heartless. And absolutely stifling democracy. I've seen people who say they were banned for encouraging voter turnout. You don't have to imagine it; it's happening, and Facebook doesn't care.
Dude the Instagram thing has been there since January.. Ooh wait, nvm.. Im on the beta contract so I get the demo of every feature update months in advance lol
Trevor going back to studio means losing all these jokes of him talking to himself. That would be a sad day
"Yes.  They now have an emoji for people who are _happy_ to be wearing a _mask."_ 😕 And apparently, a little time to kill.
People  need to go to school and learn
Yeah they have all the info all the money treat their employees like trash and know more about you than you do
Are we just going to ignore that Qannon is being removed because they are right?
Ain't nobody wanna use bing or eBay 🤦🤦🤦 old people with old people solutions. There needs to be higher taxes and we need to be paid for our data. I know you ain't tryna use some random third party browser that does the same thing as google.
I thought Facebook is only relent to people 40 and up? And what of Microsoft? Too small? Just asking
Only the rich are allowed to speak. Good luck with that.
Hay does his google predictive text sound like donald trump
this will just be used to censor progressives and push the now cryptonazi maga terrorists who already speak meme code and moved over to discord and telegram ages ago to form their terrorist cell structures
So that whole Hollywood sextrafficking thing where this guy had an island where he kept underaged sex slaves and somehow died in prison was a hoax? Dunno about q annon (really never got to me), but, like, wasn't the claim, that some high society people commit that kind of disgraceful atrocities kinda proven?
Who, what, where, why and how . . . . . . . . . . . . . . you have a rash on your ass?
🤔what was that 1st thing in our american culture? You know the first thing that we actually wrote down? Oh! The first amendment!  Unless this leads to canceling religion as well qanon is in that same boat with all of the  other cults, flat earthers, anti vaxers, jesus freaks, alex jones
When Trump was asked to condemn white supremacy during the debate, he said "sure" twice, is she deaf?  Also she needs to educate herself. Mexican is not a race, neither is Muslim. There is no correlation between having a border, banning 6 muslim countries and "racism". In Charlottesville, some people who didn't want the statues to be pulled down, were good people, that's correct. Not all of them were Nazis. Therefore, logically there were good people on both sides. There's nothing inherently irrational, wrong or racist about this statement. What's wrong is to make people feel emotionally disturbed by constantly lying about Trump being a racist. In fact, this is what is dividing the country: lies!
How much it will bring to ban those Qonan bullcrap is another question. And I also wanted to right this: 3:29 ^^
Ha ha ha ha!  😷😉
*Don't rush breaking up monopolies*
Great news. This should really help bookstores in 1997 lol.
Could you address the Trump campaign using MLK in their ads? Unless you already have.
Qanon is nimbly identifying idiots. All we have to do is track and kill them now. How hard will that be? I wouldn't shut them up. First you have the Amendment; and then it's a window into their souls, which must be understood to be overcome.  Like the mega donors in politics; follow the money and you'll find out who's playing these people. Follow the money.
I'm with YOU! Just the HIGHLIGHTS people!! Same with Facebook.
CookookookooAnon CookookookooAnon
Trevor be getting out more pls..😂😂
What about BANKS NOW THEIR CONCERNED !
The upraising of the caves hunters
So censorship is just fine now? Why not ban BLM or ANTIFA post they’ve caused billions of dollars in damage and more deaths. But I guess someone making a conspiracy video is more important than safety and well being of everyone else. Typical left wing
Amen!!!!
"No human would think an onion is sexy" Rule 34 man. (checks pornhub) There's a tag for "onion ass".   Not sure what it means but it exists.
Onions are like ogres they both have layers ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) sorry too sexual
Beat Trump by supporting Biden/Harris 2020 https://buckget.com/user-profile/JoeBiden/
Um.....leave out the "kilis babies in satanic rituals" and add Republicans to the offender groups and you have Jeffrey Epstein's ring.   Methinks facebook doth protest too much.
It's both hilarious and angering that QAnon push conspiracy theories about a secret government ring of child sex trafficking and think Trump is trying to take them down, yet there is plenty of photos and video of Trump partying and hanging out with actual convicted child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. Based on that alone, there is more evidence that Trump is connected to child sex trafficking than any allegations about a secret government ring. Let's not forget that Trump used to barge into the dressing room at his Miss Teen USA pageants so he could check out the naked underage contestants. You'd think Trump would be Public Enemy #1 to them if they actually gave a shit about saving the children.
I wouldn't call Apple a monopoly. They have major competition in every industry they're involved in.
If twitter blocks negative comments Trump followers won't have to deal with facts.

Break Amazon, Apple, Google in two parts and you will make two more powerful giants. Just leave them as they are to reduce the number of powerful companies

some sound technician should check trevors sound. thats way too heavy on the high shelf
YOU BURIED THE LEAD! The point
5:20 why is the insta they showing in German. Nothing against German it's my language. But I just found it extremely random lol.
😷
That's a good looking Onion *wink wonk*
Ok, crazyest thing i heard on romanian page of qanon is that " the Pope witch apear at tv and on the balcony is a hologram , because the real Pope isarested with most of preasts frome vatican for children abuse" and soon trump will reveal this
Big tech companies are so popular because they killed off all competition. In Europe we still have competition between amazone and other online shops but they strangle competition by losing money for years until the other companies go bust. Then they increase prices. Basically we have a form of communism but instead of a state monopoly we have private monopolies.   Hiding negative comments is a slippery slope because tech companies decide what's negative and what is not. Sure you have clear cases but you also have gray areas. They decide what people can discuss and can talk about and what things are banned. They control what we see and what we can talk about and the way we can talk about it.
5G, Tik Tok, & Huawei Security? or US 5 eyes spy network, Google, Facebook and Twitter under Covid19?  USA 217,253+   UK 42,592   Canada 9,554  Australia 897   NZ 25   China  4,634. Colonisation is so last century. Vietnam 35 is safer than Trump's Herd immunity. China - 5G Cities.   Japan - Flying cars.   USA - Trump.
Facebook stopping Trump rhetoric, right wing, pinky power, conspiracy stupidity?  Next they'll be deactivating the auto camera on feature when you open Facebook? They may even deactivate the auto keylog search? Yeah, Na, doubt it!
At least some good news. I think they should have taken down these conspiracy theories so long ago. And I didn't understand how the onion could possibly be sexual and then I realized it looked like hypothetically a piece of a woman's chest. 😞😞😞 Ok then. And hiding negative comments? Ok that is a little better. It's like they're trying to get me to finally join the platform. I mean not like I care what people think of me but either way bullying ain't nice.
I saw one of those Antifa people at the mall yesterday.  She was there with a woman wearing a QAnon T-shirt. They arrived in a vehicle driven by a Mexican. I have many, many people that will vouch that it's true.
Sabotage in the standards of "how to be a fancy thief" is the answer   When you look at the answers and know it. but told to focus on the questions.  Only look at what's being asked are told only pick a simple side. When the sides arnt even the full meal.  Your told only focus on the question.  Pick a side.   Me- but I didn't even order this. And I'm hungry.   Just others trying to make sales and bad sales

It's called an onion booty for a reason lol
The actual emoji for anti-maskers is 🍆
Can you guys do one story with out doing terrible impressions
That instagram thing doesn't always work. I was feuding with someone who called me an idiot multiple times and even called me the n word so I got pissed off and finally called them a dumbass and a bitch, and now that comment is gone, but all of their comments are still up.
Idk Trevor... The saying "She has an ass like an onion" exists for a reason... Lmfao.
We are Q duh
Obviously q anon goes too far like with bullshit about supporting trump but is it really that far fetched to think Epstein’s connections didnt go into government and media, in which case it seems not that hard to believe in there’s a group of super rich people with their hands in government and media who also are deeply depraved predators. I mean just look at the history of the us including all the governments they toppled which just coincidentally had dictators afterwards who let corporations essentially use the modern equivalent of slave labor through paying pennies a day to third world people after their country has been economically wrecked. Then some actually believe it’s moral because it’s the best paying option available to them. It’s set up
Jian-Yang code fail
yes lets censore everything so we can have our safe space

You got to give props to 4chan or whoever was the individual behind it. It's actually pretty damn funny,  thank god for 4chan!
Such first world problems hhh
Research FBI agent Ted Gunderson. Then try to pretend Qanon isn't spot on.
The only reason for their monopoly isn't alone that people like to use them. It's also thanks to ineffective competitive authorities that fail to prevent monopolies from being born. Like forbidding corporations from buying their competitors or deliberately driving them out of business by lowering prices so that they don't even get profit for it until the smaller competitor is backrupt.
When they're done with the tech companies, how about breaking down Disney and dissolving control of its 9000 unrelated subcompanies.
Please comment on kamala’s performance not being as aggressive as she should have been last night
Ok, and when will YouTube ban Flat Earth idiots / Moonlanding denying idiots / religious idiots?
You have to admit, the onions were thicc
Why would someone start a company that produces several products and then LET the government forces them to break it into smaller companys.  I would think if they wanted that they would've started different companies for each product independently.  Whether the company is one large company or 15 smaller ones.  The same person(s) own them.  What difference does it make.
I love onions and I love Trevor... this was a very arousing clip for me 😥💦
😷
u know, paying for amazon prime is literally just paying a huge extra tax for having a mail service? i always thought americans hate taxes, but they made the entire western world pay alot more.
😷
It's clear that Trever never seen a old school cooking show.
lame lol
When I see someone who needs a smile and we're wearing masks, I raise my lower eyelids to smile and stick my tongue out too; because they can't see it: and it makes me happy.
Big fan of your show Plz do a episode of Indian media Plzz plzz plzzz
Censorship is used by people who don’t want an informed or educated public, or at least a thought-provoking one. Every person has the right to say what they want about about they want, and to listen to anyone talk about whatever it is they want to talk about. There’s no need for privatized groups of people to say “no, you can’t watch this video, you can’t listen to this podcast, and no you can’t even state your opinion because its a lie or its disinformation or it goes against our narrative, which is in the people’s best interest of course.” We don’t need that. We don’t want that. And we ain’t having it! Every person has the right to think freely and to choose where they get their information. No one needs the thought police censoring individuals who speak their truth or speak against the narrative of privatized groups. What we need is conversation amongst the people, not censorship.
Some of Trump's right wing racist extremists that had been plotting to start a civil war, the Wolverine Watchmen, were just arresting by the FBI. Fox News: https://youtu.be/8nH4sPzDWG8  In other news: 🌀 Hurricane Delta is now in 84 degree water and headed towards Lake Charles where half of the homes are covered with blue tarps. With sheet metal and projectiles still laying around everywhere it's going to be very dangerous, so please evacuate now!   Trump robbed FEMA so he could attempt to buy votes for $300 so there are no disaster relief funds left, but he will surely toss everyone some paper towels! 🇵🇷  Sadly, according to his tax returns he can't personally afford Bounty, and since he doesn't have a charity to divert funds from, expect an off brand from the dollar store!
Every time the end credits run, and it’s the old pre-’rona Trevor, I’m like, “AHHH!!! NO PUT IT BACK TO THE NORMAL TREVOR!”
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
"No human would think an onion is sexy" You've clearly never been to my city
Watch OTHER websites become OVERRUN with these conspiracy nutballs = Youtube , Reddit , TikTok , et al, GET READY 4 IT !!!!!!
Highlights
The problem is that if you publically announce your pulling down fake news, the conspiracy theorists are going to say that it’s because Facebook is trying to brainwash you. You can’t win with people who want to believe in conspiracy theories
I can tell when people laugh and smile under their masks LOL!  But they may just be making pervy faces...  this is true... LOL!

AND PRESIDENTS TOO
THEIR JUST MAD THAT THE NEW GUYS ARE MAKING MORE MONEY THAT THEY ( THE GOOD OLE BOYS ) ARE.........
*YOU HAVE THE OPTION TO GET A HUMAN TO VERIFY ACCEPTABILITY OF YOUR FACEBOOK  POST❗ I've done it a few times.*
Qanonions have a layer of nothing at their center. That undressing leads nowhere. It makes me want to cry.
They just made qanon up. The government is satanic
QAnon "kill babies in satanic rituals" vid left out "and EAT them to stay young"  These psychozombies think people are EATING KIDS to stay young❗
I think it's not so much that they are a big company, but that they get political clout, with that wealth. What needs to be reigned in is not so much the companies, but their influence. This swapping CEO's with Adminstration personnel, and the ability for a retired congressman to then become a Lobby member, and make millions at it. The SEC, for example, or the FDA are examples of this CEO swapping. Look it up.
No freedom of speech anymore?
See where that gets you.  Look at what happen to A T & T.  Still bait & switch tactics.  They will find away to exploit Americans.
Wasn't the Church of Satan just collecting socks or something for the homeless? While "Christians" are cool with refugee children just going missing and donating to the Kenosha shooter?
Google is a monopoly because Android and Apple.
Need hiding of negative comments in YouTube too.
About fucking time. Our anti-trust laws are horribly outdated.
I looked at this video and I did not laugh. I just see a sea of morons.
These Q People are Super Dangerous... They Hate the Royals to, they are the center of their Conspiracies...
I think facebook censoring this is a terrible idea, as Trevor said it's just gonna reinforce the idea the corporatists are pedophiles. Also this is a slippery slope to social media authoritarianism. Free speech should be protected anywhere, both in social media and real life, otherwise it'll just be china but digital with zuckerberg as xi xing ping
😷
The end!!! I make that face, too!
When I started this video, I didn't expect that Trevor would defend big tech monopolies in a weird way. It's not that the tech companies themselves are solely bad. Monopolies are inherently bad for competition and democracy due to the amount of power they wield. That shouldn't be a hard concept to understand 🤨
You know religion is going too far in claiming Satanic rituals are still being done. Lmao
Well about time Facebook looked out for people's sanity these conspiracies are getting out of hand...
It's dumb to remove negative comments from instagram because most people on that site are already disconnected from reality.   Now you're really giving them a safe space. The world isn't all sunshine and lollipops.
The social delima documentry on Netflix.A must watch
Bruuuuh when you mentioned moon landing conspiracies, my lil google home explained what it was lmaoooo
Columbus was actually commissioned and sent by Spain. I'm an Italian American who is also native and I think Columbus was an idiot, who was not in the west Indies where he thought he was. Native Americans never were Indians but yet we cling to Columbus' stupidity. Indigenous People Day! Or Month! ?!?!

Isn't it one of the Satanic tenets NOT to harm children or the something? Would be a shame if someone used that to break up all those Q conspiracy theories
I'm a Trucker and there is a lot of missing Children i see at truck stops which this should be biggest news in America i believe 😢 😔 🙏
I lost an entire FB over a butternut squash
They broke up the Standard Oil Trust but that only made Rockefeller America's first Billionaire, and that's in the 1900s. If they break up Amazon they might just make Bezos the wealthiest man that ever lived. Start ups hope to be acquired by big tech, its a dream come true for many of them. Instead of breaking them up, hire ex tech workers to help increase regulation in the industry, so that start ups that don't want to sell will be protected, cus the aim is to ensure that there's fair competition in the market.
So Qanon thinks only rich Democrats are baby killers. But rich Republicans are not 🤔
Good thing there is so many choices when it comes to things like Internet and TV providers...
What's the different charging cable Treeevor?
Is like Trump supporters finally got their Gateway computers to work and were able to connect to the internet with their AOL trial disk. I never I understood why people make conspiracies just google megan's law and you can find all the PEDOS you want.  No conspiracy needed.
I was on my finsta and posted a screenshot of a conversation I was having with a guy who has a GF with the caption “men are trash” and it got taken down for hate speech🤦🏽‍♀️
The GOVERNMENT IS JUST TRYING TO MAKE THE MONEY THEY ARE MAKING.

This dude is effing hilarious!
Sometimes I watch this stuff while I'm eating.. so cool it with the disgusting jokes.
That's what I call "Funions," what next, ban photos of cucumbers and egg plant?
DO NOT VOTE FOR BIDEN HE IS A RACIST HE ONLY THINKS  BLACK WOMEN STACKING THE SHELVES IN A STORE THERE ARE BLACK WOMEN WHO ARE NURSES AND DOCTORS VOTE REPUBLICAN 2020
This is not party specific, but to all of us whom it applies;  Romans 1:28, "And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.”  Titus 1:16, "They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good work.”  2 Timothy 3:8, “Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith.”     The reprobate mind abounds. There is a God and in his word, the bible, there is no shortage of examples of what we are seeing happen in our nation this very moment.      America has rejected truth and therefore God, in favor of a leader who is not worthy of his country, or its people, yet many have eyes, but see not.
Lol once i reported a profile on Fb that showed a couple having intercourse in multiple pics (explicitly!). They said it didnt go against their guidelines. I havnt enjoyed Fb since.
I love how Trevor trys yo Make you belive qanon is not real he knows damn well these people are Satanist
I believe that child trafficking should be taking seriously. I would also protest out there on the streets, but QAnon is a cult. These theories are extremely dangerous that could get them in trouble.
What little white dots?
i thought america is about "freedom of speech"? censoring this, censoring that...... if you're going to keep censoring everything, stop boasting about being "the land of the free". 🙄🙄🙄
Thank god, I’m so sick of hearing gullible friends and family members who believe  those insane QAnon conspiracy theories!
Suddenly the big tech starts to lean left
I have found Donald Trump’s number one fan! This guy is a perfect representation of the present republican party! YouTube channel, William H.
I hate instagram
128 people at the US Capitol have acquired COVID19 IN THE LAST 7 MONTHS, WH SAYS THEY KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH COVID19   TAIWAN A COUNTRY OF 22 MILLION JUST HIT 500 TOTAL COVID19 CASES  TRUMPS LEADERSHIP  No masks Trump continues to spew false hoods about covid calling it the flu  Experts predict 410,000 deaths by January 1 2021,   or 14x the number of deaths, during an average flu season in less than a year.
WHAT TOOK FACEBOOK SO LONG TO REMOVE Q?
I wrote trump is contagious and it was blocked on Instagram.
Never mind banning QAnon - find out who it is.
Those were some pretty sexy onions.
Hope u talk about how Kamala  Embarrassed herself yesterday
QAnon worshippers: Democrats, Hollywood, and rich people are pedophiles that sacrifice and eat babies!!! Oh, except rich republicans, Hollywood republicans, priests, and any other republican that fancy children. They don’t count.
Actually, generally speaking, knitting groups are doing really well at fighting hate right now. Ravelry, the biggest online space for knitters and crocheters, explicitly supports the movement for Black lives, and they've even banned support of 45 as hate speech! Crafters are less backwards than you'd think!! https://www.ravelry.com/content/no-trump
They probably figured out that "Q" is Alex Jones and simply banned him again for his ridiculous rants.
Shampoo?!?!? That guy looks like he's in dire need a sum JHERI CURL, dog!
Instagram now dictates what is and is not offensive
once i was silently sobbing in public but had the mask so nobody noticed heheeh
QAnon is the rash on the American crotch. It has to go! Apply the cream. Drown it. Air it out. Goodbye Felicia.
If Microsoft was deemed a monopoly, then Amazon, Apple and Google are too.
Blocking Q only gonna create more followers
This dude is fucking hilarious.. Should do stand up.
Saw a truck with a sticker that said. 'I think that's why I vote Republican.' Right below it was two identical Qanon stickers. Quite the self inflicted injury.
https://youtu.be/2hRSIzTQNh0
okay... lemme get this straight  These people are ok with us being owned by the same 8 people for our day to day products (grocery, household items, etc)  These people are ok with the idea that only five companies provide the whole nation with internet and split the nation so that no two companies directly rival each other.   We are entirely ok with Dinsey holding a monopoly on fairy tales and holding copyrights on those fairy tales...they even pushed to extend copyright laws (it used to be after 50 years, enough time to accumulate the maximum amount of wealth on a franchise you can in a lifetime, a franchise or copyrighted thing becomes "public domain"...Disney changed that to like 100-150 years, meaning in america, no other company is allowed to make a production of a beauty and the beast musical.  The stage production is also owned by Disney in America)  But, Facebook, Amazon, Google, are no good cuz monopoly  First off, Google isn't a monopoly, Bing and Yahoo still get enough business to remain active for searching.  Firefox and Edge are also active and healthy  The government is working actively now to find a legal reason to remove the only companies that continue to support Net Neutrality
It’s to late now they want to do it
I forgot Facebook owns Instagram.
Signs you need to get out of the house: you've begun sexualizing onions🥴✔️
Cry me a q...
Damnit. Trevor! Grandmother’s knitting group is not knitting Qanon pillows! We are making “vote blue” masks! Pay attention. Old women are not the bigots you’re looking for.
@2:58 that might actually be true 🙃 over 500k kids go missing in the USA every year.
There is a Russian hacker(code name 'Q') in a bunker near Moscow who is just laughing his butt off at how easy it was to punk these Q-nuts. This goes to the sorry state of American education that we have so many people who can't recognize a fact when they see it, can't reason about those facts, and then, can't think critically to develop a reasonable conclusion about the facts. Should these people who are so mentally handicapped even be allowed to vote?
I ♡ u trevor...thank you for making my day😂
FB banned a picture of my dog from my stories stating that it contained nudity and or was sexual in content! 🤦‍♀️ #fbfail #bot 🙄
I honesty knew this was happening. I mean,next thing you know Disney,Apple,Amazon,Microsoft and Google will be combined into one and I wouldn't be surprised
Vote for Joe B. before it's too late.
I don't care what Facebook does. I don't think it will help. People just make new code words, so they can get around algorithms.I just cant get behind censoring the Internet in general. The more you censor conspiracy theorists, the stronger they get. And it's already reached main stream media. You can't ignore it, you have to educate people so they don't believe this crap.
😂
“kill babies in satanic rituals” is prolly the most stupidest thing ive ever heard in my life
You really have to go back to the studio, YouTube is not your strong ambient.
The truth is already out., Qanon is a military intelligence.  They trying to debunk Qanon but I'm not part of them.
People should be responsible for what they said on any internet. If you lie on internet, and causing bad influence on public, you should get a law suit. Well lots of people who post fake news will be in jail then. Including CNN, BBC, Fox News.
Get mad if you wanna, I won't front.  Cause I got a new tape and it's full of bump!
Free speech?  Excuse me?  1984?
Ain't no future in the frontin'.
Stop Moving So Much, You Make SeaSick. I'm Really High.
Democrats should absolutely refuse to let Biden debate Trump again.   They cheat, interupt, and spread virus.   The only way we can lose this is if Biden fucks up the debate. Don't give them the chance.   No more 2020 debates!
F****** crazy man the whole world has gone crazy
So brave
Hey, does anyone else want to protest stop lights with me, FOR FREEDOM!
"Without babies, that's 90 percent of Facebook posts gone".  - Trevor Noah 2020
Love the Black Lives Matters in the background. Thats gonna piss of Qanons so much.
The computer didn't make a mistake when it allowed pictures of a woman having sex with an animal and practicing fellatio with a horse. this id on Facebook, where some teens are allowed to go.
no one would think an onion is sexy!  You sir have never heard of Japan
BREAK UP THE MONOPOLIES!!!  said Big Pharma and BiG OiL,  tell it to Ma Bell.  you have Sprint and Verizon and Xfinity because they broke up the Bell System Phone Company. well not really, all of these ''providers'' rent line time from the still extant Bell System.
Definitey too little, too late.
the people that scream censorship the loudest are often spreading hate and disinformation. at this point you have to seek out the bullshit if you really want to know about it, it's not being presented on the ''free'' public platform.  the Internet is Infinite, you're not limited to social media and video sites, remember web pages? still out there......
I feel like this is like trying to break up general electric in the 80s
Pointing out that powerful people can get away with human rights violations, including sexual abuse, has always been controversial 🤷🏻‍♀️
He cut Me Deep.Real Deep!
The Trump Pandemic and the Trump Recession have really harmed the American people.
Haven’t used FB since 2016. Looking back I think I made the right choice
Just saying, sexual abuse with children amongst the elite, doesnt seem far fetched. The Satanic rituals go too far and Im sure only a portion of those elites is involved in any potential child sex stuff. But all the other qanon shit it pure bs
I disagree slightly here, breaking them up into smaller companies does not necessarily hurt the quality their services, it just balances power. They wont lose their assets of production, as long as ur careful with who will manage what, u wont lose any productivity. I think. america's capitalism is out of hand and doing something about it is for sure a good thing.
Instagram flagged my comment as a negative one because i told somebody, in a totally innocuous way, the proportions in his drawing were off... I was in no way rude or condescending. Funny thing is i got a notification saying that post has recieved similar comments; but the only reason i offered that critique in the first place was because i looked at the comment section and there was nobody in there saying the proportions were off. They're censoring constructive criticism
Hiding negative comments on Instagram... now if someone posts conspiracy crap, Instagram hides any comments saying it's wrong.  "Grate" idea.
Please do not cut your hair Trevor!!
so...Facebook bans qanon AND hides negative comments. same company
It's not just you, it did just get hot in here.
algorithms hmmmm
Ha !
You are right Trevor, it is too little too late for Facebook and Twitter to step up. It’s a good thing they did but they have been responsible for creating a lot of hate being an outlet for lotta crazies and a megaphone for those who has sought to destroy Our laws and norms.
Nobody uses Facebook You boomer
Lmao😂😂Sexy Onions
Back in the late 70's or so, a friend started up a DIY mag here in Austin called (I think) Sluggo. One issue was printed with a mostly blank cover so that a little party could be held for people to create unique covers for each and every  magazine before it was distributed. We had crayons, scissors. magazines, paste and I don't know what all. For one of my covers, I found a topless model in a Cosmo. I then found pictures of pearl onions. They fit PERFECTLY over the model's breasts. I captioned it with, "Why don't you suck on an onion, big boy?" I pretty much grossed everyone out. So onions CAN be kinda sexy. Sorta.
Shill
Japan has been wearing masks as a courtesy since, I dunno, the 100's? But yeah, this is nothing new to them. @ the very end bit.
American news is garbage if theres a segemnt about emoji changes
Censorship doesn't stop the message. It only makes people more interested in the message.
Funny how they allowed them to get that big. 🤔
Why does the creepy Google-guy  „Rash on the crotch“ sound like Donald Trump? 😂
amazon is to big that is for sure
Because Q tells the TRUTH
Remember  if a hole  can. Be drilled  in it......
You know who thinks unions are sexy? Shrek loves unions, because he is an union. Shrek is love, Shrek is life!
Do the same to game companies.
How did you kno of the supposed Rash on my Crotch?!? Deep State Fake News!
Qanon is not a conspiracy group. The Anthony Weiner laptop has been confiscated. There are thousands of items that prove cases of pedophilia, child trafficking, and torture. Hillary deleted those emails for a reason and channels like this NEED you to forget about it. I use to like this guy too, but they’re all complicit. They’re hiding it all, and they know they’ve been caught.
With the instagram story, it could also be bad for people who want to hurt themselves by reading negative comments; there's a convenient button they can just click and read them all in a concentrated group
Maybe Zuckerberg is shutting down all the QAnon people so that people will focus on that and not uncover that truth about his reptillian identity.
More loss of free speech....
And why don't they do this with big oil and big Pharma
Remember when the daily show actually was a program that made a difference. Trevor Noah is such a tool.
That afro Trevor. Love it!
IG comment section is absolute toxicity.
ALL THE TECH COMPANIES HAVE POLITICIANS INVESTED IN THEM! As well as every other commodity they regulate!
Anyone else having their Google voice activated around 2:16 ?
I cant believe trevor kink shamed me for loving onions.
So Instagram hired Butters to filter the negative comments🤣🤣🤣
I got banned from facebook for showing a photo of trump and ivanka. Lol, they said it was overtly sexual, and for the 30 days, I just laaauuughed and laughed about it.
You are a crack up Trevor! I love your show. 🤣🤣
Why isn't Trevor talking about the debate and the fly? 😂
Trevor trust me, Shrek will definitely think onions are sexy XD
They're hiding negative comments? Naw its just my dark humor going over ur head
🤣
😂😂😂 a much needed laugh
The big techs isn't a problem as long as they don't abuse their power and they pay their fair share of taxes. And you can't say Google is morally the same as Facebook cuz theyre big tech. "Big tech" is kind of really really broad.
So what was the answer to the rash thing? I'm asking for a friend...😂
QAnon was actually a typo, they meant to call themselves QAnus
Sounds like Russia to me . Lol
Fun fact - after WW2 the U.S. forced Japan to break down and split up the at the time dominating business conglomerates. They were lead by the extremely wealthy families Mitsubishi, Yasuda, Sumitomo, Mitsui.   But when it‘s an American company it‘s of course a completely different thing 😒
Breaking: New video showing what Kamala Harris & Nancy Pelosi did to their own city https://youtu.be/oG9R2PuqaMQ
Yay!! Damn right!! Break up those big Tech's!!!
Finally!!!!!!
onions: sexual  shrek: muffled groans
Really surprised to see Noah making a weird argument for how breaking up big companies could be a bad thing... corporate shill
Watch this short video that trump is scared that you might see:  "Gasping For Air", in YouTube https://youtu.be/TqENwyonvBc
Dude I glad you said something about IG censoring comments. I see tons of racist comments against POC but if I say someone is garage, it gets deleted.  Dana White has shown racist tendencies but if you try to say anything about that, it gets flagged and removed.
how about we just make them actually pay taxes first..
2:52 Replace "Democrats" with "Republicans" and id believe it
Americans on BOTH sides of the aisle are NOT fools. Life-long Democrats and Independents know what a Harris/Biden ticket will do to their lives & the lives of their friends & families future/ one of continuous lawlessness and economic turmoil. When it comes to Election Day they will swallow the Red Pill and vote Republican. I and my entire family support the POTUS, but we do not tell anyone, nor do we have a bumper sticker and signs in the front yard, for which we represent 10s of millions of American Citizens that represent a silent majority that will come out to vote election day. Pence destroyed Kamala with facts and pressed questioning that Harris could not or would not answer, knowing that it will clearly turn undecided voters toward the Trump/Pence ticket. Yet Kamala's silence speaks volumes. Conservatives will undoubtedly gain the house, keep the Senate, and win the reelection. Americans CAN NOT afford a Biden/Harris presidency where their livelihood is hampered and continuous rioting, looting, and violence in the streets, unchallenged and /or in fact - encouraged under a Harris/Biden administration. Americans on BOTH sides of the aisle, both sides supremely understand that their lives will continue to spiral out of control with Harris and Biden at the helm of the United States economy.
Doesn't anyone think that banning certain things, even if it is misinformation, is the oppression of free speech? I just don't understand the left's logic. So if people put conspiracy theories online its "undermining democracy", but if they ban it is not? I understand that they are conspiracy theories, but people are free to believe in what they choose. And leftists can use all their leftist media and free speech in order to disprove the freedom of speech. Additionally, there are many instances where these companies ban speech made by republicans just because they don't agree what them. There are actual misinformation spread by the left. Anyone reading this, when Trump said,"there are good people on both sides," he was refering to people who wanted to change the name of the park, and people who didn't. And in that same press conference, he condemned white supremacy, watch it for yourself(search up Trump says there are good people on both sides) and he has done it multiple times. It is misinformation like this that actually undermines democracy if anything but Republicans doesn't demand that it is banned because we believe in freedom of speech.
Mark Zuckerberg is going to beam up to his home planet and get advice from the alien overlords.
Oooh that ending was amazeballs lol
You are so funny Trevor, good stuff! The mask emoji is insane 😩
Trump is 💩
Qanon spreading theories about rich people is bad but you people doing the same in the case of trump is good. The hypocrisy.
How wbout illuminati
Onions? I reported a photo on fb that angled itself to focus on a  baby's bare private parts and they replied they found no problem. So, no biggies to potential paedophilic material then.
And tiktok makes you read the guidelines
the amount of blatant scams that get greenlit as ad's on Facebook is insane, considering its a direct stream of revenue maybe they should start hiring live people to frigging monitor it.  as it is I just assume any ad on facebook is a scam, pretty sure thats gonna screw up your ability to sell ad's to legit companies eventually.
Trevor is right, people having to click to see negative comments is going to make them view even more of them.
Oh man, I was so expecting "some freaky shit under there" to involve onions...
i honestly blame youtube for the toxicity we see on fb. fb was like myspace in the beginning but you could see updates easier without having to visit individual pages (which i kinda miss),  then youtube came out roughly the same time, but nearly immediately became a toxic breeding ground for misinformation videos and the meanest comments you can come up with. when regular people started loading videos of their regular life, other regular people felt it their obligation to make this person who's happy doing their thing but isn't that good yet give up on their dreams.
Facebook know there worth  My nika
Sexy onions😂
Quackadoodles are whiny today!#!.. Damn!...😂😂😂
Than create a program to entice new business owners to go into the tech based industry. That way they have more competition and change the standards.
Hi would you take a moment from this craziness to help a sick puppy. Please Help Blu Beat the Puppy Cancer Blues ​@t thank you!
When Tiktok banned some negative video, account and negative comments, Facebook was saying "Tiktok is danger and no freedom speech".  Now, Facebook is following the TikTok's idea.
Social media platforms are like public toilets that nobody can keep clean & hygienic.
Wow. That's great.
Finally no more onionsexuele adds...🍆
Government doesn't like anyone or anything having more powerful than their owners have.
😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷
Actually, "onion" is used to say "anus" in French slang, so maybe that's why it was blocked in Canada ;)
Finally Q-anon has been banned. Really!! The conspiracy theories are just completely out there!!!
dude needs to stay in his own lane on this 1...these children aren't lying in my opinion https://youtu.be/2K0HwYj9tZE
💯👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Wait, they took hold of monopolies and that’s bad?  Then why do we play monopoly as a training tool for children who need to be taught greed???
I don’t give a F-K what those crazy fools think.  They’re all nuts.
4:37 .. that is hilarious.🍑🍆
Congress is a monopoly too... Can we break them up yet 😂😂
My advice: stop using Facebook. I did 4 years ago.
I’d love to see what jokes he will have for the VP debate!!  Wow people, watch the full debate!  You owe it to your to children.  Voting for our president is voting for our future.  They are not showing you the truth!  Kamala had no argument! When she said, you must make friends and stay loyal. She was referring to China. While every country is walking away from China. Kamala an Biden will have us on our knees, while China takes us over! Pence won it when he brought up swine flu. Obama with Biden did so badly with it. that if it was Covid. millions of people would be dead today.   https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html  As far as their strategy with Covid. They’re riding the coattails of the president. Basically saying they would do exactly what’s already being done today. The New York Times wrote an article stating, There was nothing more Trump could do!  Watch the full Debate!!   The best part. Was when she said we must remain friends and be loyal to China!! Doesn’t the fact that just about all other countries are against China. Mean anything to her! How about when China stole our covid research. And what about how they kept all the PPE from us! This woman makes me sick.  You want to talk about a countries security risk!!   Watch the full Debate!!
...I miss Jon Stewart
When are they going to censor churches then???
🦀Q is gone🦀
Lmao so we will have precedent to crack down on corporation
Is'nt a violation of the first amendement ? I know lies and manipulating people's opinion is wrong but where is the line? I thought there was no line in the US...
Hair cut URGENT. you look so weird. mate
🧅🧅💦 r u thirsty?
Cancel your FB accounts people. Me and all my friends have, well, sort of, FB makes you wait 30 days b4 they shutdown your account in case you change your mind.  FB is toxic!!
those onions are just begging to be peeled, don't believe the tears
QAnon is banned? Awesome! 🥳
My wife who is Thai just told me and showed me that the "World Health Organization" just asked Thailand how to achieve what they have with the coronavirus issues. I would like to applaud them. America has lost 654 people per million.  Thailand has lost .8 per million. or America has lost 216,889 as of now and Thailand has lost 59. Who is taking care of who? America has 4 percent of the world’s population and 22 percent of the world’s confirmed Covid-19 deaths. IF YOU ARE WONDERING, See how we are doing compared to the rest of the world, it's sickening if you are from the U.S. The rest of the world is serious! https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
I think it's a good idea 😂
Lol
Why just target the tech industry , most industries in US have monopolies and have worse effects for the people ( cough, Big Pharma !!, Lobbies , gun lobby , NRA , all powered by monopolies) . . Break up monopolies across the board.
Moon Landing was definitely fake and no one is allowed to land there, with current technology, because of suppression from Tesla technology. You trust anyone hidding the truth about extraterrestrials and practically everything else?
MR. Trevor Noha, The Best... Sir, You make me laugh so much and I forget my Pain...  Had so many surgeries last year and the year before that... but your Jokes and your Show, kept me Marching to a Great recovery ... Thank you, Sir. God Bless you and Everyone with You... 2018, 2019 Hospital Laughters Love. 2020 - 2021, Let's Go! 👍👌🙌
😷😷😷
Qanon people are so stupid. Based on the criteria of a mega-wealthy person being apart of it.... wouldn’t trump be number 1 on their list lmao #dumbaf
I wonder why Facebook doesn't ban BLM or Antifa accounts.  Instagram banning negative comments is hilarious. People are so sensitive now.
When you find out bill burr is one of those people that believe in conspiracies 😂
Making faces behind my mask is my favorite pastime at the grocery store now days
😷 mine is not smiling yet
😀😃😄😁😆😅😂🤣☺️😊😇🙂🙃😉😌🤧😷😷
I stick my tongue out at people under my mask, almost constantly.
Breaking them up will make the end user experience worse in the short term, I’d like to get more quality choices without messing up the options I have.   Now, if the THREAT of being broken up keeps them in line, that would benefit me.  For instance, I kinda like the MS ecosystem for planning (onenote, moca, to-do, sticky notes), but I’m not going to give up gmail for outlook.  If antitrust makes them let me add google calendar events to their planners, then that’d be great.
Your fro is soooooooo cute!
Hahahah I use google for searching an facebook for nothing an I dont have a Instagram or any of those dumb social apps hahaha
Damn i was thinking the same when onion thing was brought up 😂😂
Can someone please tell me what Qanon is??
The craziest part of QAnon is they claim Trump is the anointed one to take them all down.
Brick and mortars are already closing shop due to the heavy weight against them.
Antitrust laws are flawed for they still allow loopholes, dependent on which state your in versus the states that will allow, for the rewards or perks. America at it's most greedy!
where would we be without you Trevor?
Net Neutrality paved the way for the aggressive progression of the powers of the big four.
Big Tech should be broken up period. Keep in mind The Daily Show is on a huge conglomerate that would prefer no regulation. There is just no justification to keep these tech companies or many corporations as large as they are.   Monopolies and Billionaires are bad for labor, competitive markets, anti-trust and democracy.
Overly sexualized onions 😂
Since when is Apple a monopoly? Can someone explanin me that?
Finally something fucking good
Facebook/Instagram have become the WORST Social Media sites since...2012? Well Insta was okay until the former owners left.... and I still have to use them
Facebook should also remove accounts who do advertising for political parties
One Qanon theory is why Trevor won’t buy a shaver? Bruh we know your ass can afford one you rich like Donald Trump
This comment feature by Instagram sounds like something I've seen on some porn sites for years. Once again, the porn industry is way ahead of everyone else.
lololol
I am definitely worried about hiding comments on insta.
These companies are too powerful. They'll drag the economy down with them before they allow themselves to be accountable. Meanwhile, Qanon will just use this move by Facebook to double down on their nonsense.
I shared a post claiming that people who worked through the pandemic would get a payment from FEMA. Then, if you click the news story it sends you to a monkey flipping you off. Facebook fact checked it. I had to share that and say Facebook can't take a joke.
Why can't it just be that they're pedophiles? I mean there's some real evidence for that.  Albeit nowhere near as many as they're claiming. Why does it have to be that they literally eat children and kill them in satan-worshipping rituals?  That's just pulled straight from someone's ass. And if it were true, then Trump would more definitely be one of them than almost anyone else.  He's a billionaire friend of Epstein's.  He's like, prime suspect.
Southpark predicted removing negative comments. 🤦🏾‍♀️
"Tech News" is too old! Elizabeth Warren have been saying that for years!
Lol that Google search 😆
Im a restaurant worker. Had a customer call boss to complain servers werent smiling enough. Thru masks. Apparently, he has x-ray vision. America. 🙄
Why does it look like you lost LOTS of weight?
Easy fix: Ban anyone over the age of 13 from using any of that crap.
Facebook is too late on this....🙄
On a more somber note regarding Qanon:   1) recall that unwitting targets and victims of electromagnetic weapons abuses were called psychotic tin foil hats for complaining about this crime.  Until American diplomats in Cuba suffered permanent brain damage from the same type of abuse. Now I have yet to hear a soul daring to call these men and women whose only crime was to serve their country, tin foil hats. 2) BBC aired a story told by an 8 yr old and his sister where, the children claimed to British investigators, on camera, that they were sexually abused by members of a group that was headed by their father. They also claimed that babies were sacrificed too.   During the questioning session by the investigator, the investigator confirmed the clinical findings of violent damage to the rectal area of the boy by medical examiners. Most children of this age seldom make up stories like this.   I am glad open-mindedness leads me to all information destinations...
Why tech and not healthcare though?
Its called a funion for a reason.
How many sweaters does this guy have?
7:37 Pro level smize.
🧅🥵
These companies are monopolies that break up business.    EA : "Oh shit."
Hey onions can be sexy too, don't discriminate!
Onion booty?🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Funny stuff
I did not see that coming in the end and I loved it!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Typical hypocrisy projection x 10,000 from the biggest corrupt monopoly in the world, the US govt! 👌🙄
We need to break up these monopolies. That’s why we have anti-trust laws and free speech. Monopolies cater to their own interests 💁🏼‍♀️.
The big brother 😒 owns Qanon and Facebook lol they caused this all on themselves trying to fuck everyone  else over at the end of the day. If you seen certian things, it's not a conspiracy theory
Ah it's all coming together, just the way the evil ends after a long period of time
YouTube has been strict about comments for a long time. The algorithm is always taking down things that aren't actually offensive
Oh but the truth is "some freaky sh*t" *is* going on in there. When I wear a mask nobody can see it when I curse their family in the forbidden language of the ancients.
Zuckerbergs wife has a cannibalism restaurant of course Facebook is eating babies!!! Look it up
How about we make them pay taxes first? VAT
Hey i am diggin the anti bully comment warning. Some people are so self entitled its scary
People on Facebook are so mean. They will literally argue over EVERYTHING smh 🤦🏽‍♀️
I guarantee you it was a out the name of the page and not the onions.
This is something that should have happened a long time ago. FB just trying to save face at this point
😷😷😷😷😷
Jealous of Facebook mxm jealous people
Trevor get a haircut.
Facebook is a hate bank.
Other stuff happening:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_2l2xvv5-8  Wink Smiley
Baning QAnon  just make people want to read it more
Fuck yea, split em up
Epstein island is real, go back to south Africa
Monitoring content should not be promoted
what the heck i s happening in this WORLD
Why are they using german stock footage for the instagram segment.?
Q anon, yes, but doesn't that fall under freedom of speech.....alot of people have been shut down just because they prove, with documents, the crimes of all governments. They start with removing one, then it continues to many others. This is all about government control! It is happening around the globe!
"Sexy Onions" needs to be on a shirt. :p
Break up the big banks
Now to google sexy onion
Breaking up big tech won't work. It also didn't work when AT&T aka Bell Systems or "Ma Bell" was broken. Instead, the broken parts of the company were merged again through various purchases & they became  an even bigger company.                                                                                   https://www.businessinsider.com/att-breakup-1982-directv-bell-system-2018-02
What happened to freedom of speech facebook?
Halloween treat: google people coughing, looks like they giving Casper a bj.
You make me laugh at how ridiculous we really are. Always keep us in ✔.
Trevor will never be as funny as this in the studio
An Onion booty is sexy. . . . . . yeh? ? ? 🤔
I have video footage of some Q folk in my state...they were posted up on the side of the highway looking like fools + disturbing the flow of traffic.
Same thing for spectrum, and broadcasting companies!
"Freedom of speech". Ha!
Damage  is already  done
Amazon Apple Facebook  Google
Microsoft is the only good tech company
Shame on you Trevor. Do some research Harvey Weinstein is not the only problem. Many predators are still working on full swing, raping women and children especially in Hollywood. And yes to the extent of torture cells and even consuming their flesh.  Perhaps you knew.
This probably will actually only strengthen q as they have a big persecution complex. They'll most likely use this as see were right the deep state or internet is trying to censor us.
Where is NEAL BRENNON? 🙃
They might be monopoly but the government isn't supposed to be involved in what other businesses should do
Like AT&T  Didn't they all get a big tax refunds, instead of having to pay taxes?
So, my daughter walked by right as the news section showed the "child trafficking pedophiles who kill children in satanic rituals" statement. She said that seemed like a contradictory crossover between pedophiles and people who sacrifice children. Asking "Don't the pedophiles want to keep the kids around?" What kind of world do we live in where my child says that to me and I have to try and explain? Also, my youngest son came up while this conversation was happening. What a mess!  I should clarify (lest someone comment that I am being irresponsible for watching this with kids around) my daughter just turned 18 and my son is gonna be 16 next month.
Don't ever cut your hair!!
"Onions have layers"      Sherk
No one likes to wear mask but we have to wear it for our safety
I Wonder If YouTube Will Follow Suite On Blocking Q-Anon Crap Too?
The Instagram warning is like the 18 over sites warning. Yeah, that works pretty well.😕
😷
Dang, you have some smooth segues.
It's not just the breaking up that the report proposes. It's mainly targeted at their anti competive and gatekeeping that the do, which can still be in place by just "breaking up" a company.
What's Qanon?
#InstagramGotItRight
This man! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
#SexyOnion
To be fair, they don't really eat babies; they drink abortion smoothies.
QAnon is just trailer park scientology
Wait a second I said too little too late before he said it I often leave comments way early
Qanon believers will take that as a sign that the shadow government tries to silent the truth
again ? i though he was already banned
They are big donors to both parties, so nobody can break them up.
I would say good for you companies for no longer promoting a hyper dangerous group of nut jobs that need to be re-educated into reality but too little too late that’s what I’m gonna say too little too late I trust neo-Nazis and skinheads and KKK way more than I trust Q anon because at least we know what those other groups believe in because people always believed they were better than other people
Qanon, Flat Earther's , creationists, Donald Trump supporters......America needs stronger meds and a better school system.
Every time I watch this show I just miss Jon more and more. Jon had biting satire of both sides and this show is just low hanging jokes.
This was the strangest news I've heard this week. 😂
No one: Trevor: onionsexual
‘If you silence one voice, you deafen the world” also “I may not agree with what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it” there are huge ramifications to censorship. I can’t stand what Q says and stands for but this is nonsense. Things like censorship have proven to radicalize people, and we know this... also, if those companies are framed as utilities than they wouldn’t be able to hide behind publisher rules or censor people for their beliefs
I never thought it was possible for Imstagram to become even more fake
If there is a qanon I can guarantee is the GOP not the Democrats
Q-anon is a  21st century version of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion
I've never had a Facebook or Instagram account! In fact, I was a backer of Oculus Rift and dropped the company cold for Vive when they were bought out by Facebook. I don't want my data stolen, sold, and then used to feed me wackadoodle conspiracy theories.
Omg had to block  Trump supporters that I thought were friends
Remember when they broke up "Ma Bell" ? Congress doesn't seem to.
"onions aren't sexy" Shrek: *behind you*
I wan prime for somebody and I don't care who it is
I will never agree with deleting things like Qanon. Each person is free to decide what to believe. They should only delete posts that lead to diffamation o similar outcomes, a direct personal damage
Finally
Facebook cracking down on onions, but white supremacy and fake news is a-okay
I love him
But Q speaks in code. There probably will be groups with secret names.
Ha! I am juuuuust immature enough to enjoy making faces at people behind my mask.
I love you and your hair.  please don't change it.  you are great and funny just the way you are.  maybe this is one good thing coming out of covid 19
YES YES YES YES YES YES
Finally people are starting to realize how this harmful cult manipulates people. If they knew the origins of where these crazy stories come from they would be appalled & maybe even realize how they've been played! The Nazis used stories just like this to demonize Jewish people..... Nevermind these geniuses are elbow deep in conspiracies same as Trump
Américain Haitian mexicain salvador portoricain Honduras latinos all immigrant go vote biden Harris démocrate 2020
What does it mean to "break up" these companies
onions = dirt apples.
Congress: "We're going after the tech companies, mostly because they support the Democrats (which is why the Dems never do it). Now, who isn't receiving funding and kickbacks from a major tech company or a subsidiary for their campaigns?" Also Congress:  <crickets> Finally Congress: "We'll get right on this upon an undetermined date, but we're totally doing it."
And then so many GOP lawmakers that believe in QAnon (says everything about their intelligence) want a place in the senate. You see the US senate in the few years from now? Democrates vs. QAnon idiots.
I never have FB, and I don't miss anything all these years 👤
Trump has deliberately flouted science, social distancing and made a mockery of masks, refusing to wear a mask in situations where it was deemed necessary by hospital authorities and medical consultants. During the onset of COVID-19 Trump repeatedly lied to the American people about the severity of the virus, repeatedly thumbing his nose in the face of science with ridiculous pseudoscience claims that could potentially endanger others, over 200,000 American citizens are now dead with the numbers climbing due to his inaction.  Statistics were not on Trumps side as he openly encouraged people to attend rallies without social distancing and other protective measures in place. He's now tested positive with the all too real possibility that prior to diagnosis, of having spread the virus to countless others through his selfishness and willful ignorance of scientific evidence.  Trump has brought this upon himself and he only has himself to blame due to his own arrogance and hubris. It's not the past lies that is the issue, but the fact is; in the future everything Trump states will be suspect and questioned just like the words of Conley, his supposed "Doctor", there is nothing transparent about that administration, the trust has long been destroyed and Pence helped drive the nail in the coffin of his Vice Presidential term. We need Biden and Harris to repair the damage done to our global reputation!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Is another four years of chaos, lies and deception what we deserve as American Citizens?
I gotta ban for the post, "Why are Trump supporters upset they have to wear a mask in public... (followed by a large group of KKK members) it never bothered them before. FB took a few days to eventually tell me my post didn't go against their standards and even said "Sorry".
Is this the fake 4chan one? I can't keep up lol.
This is probably happening because Facebook pulled Trumps covid post the other day.  Remember he went after Twitter when they fact checked him.
Q is huge on reddit/4chan/all other chans, they'll move there.... thanks, gonna have to delete my reddit soon
I doubt about amazon being split up.
QAnom is the rash on the crotch.
(H)Justa lökar ! A swedish saying for Nice breasts probably made its way into the algorithms database.
"shrek join's the chat"
They see the writing on the wall for trump so they are taking their balls back🤣
😷😷
Facebook needs to be regulated.  It's toppled governments and spread conspiracies that get people killed.
Looks like FB figured out Biden is gonna win the elections.
i have been-  Shadow Banned - by Youtube for 18 months look it up like if you can SEE this please comment on this - Thanks
facebook is a choice not a necessity - if you don't like it - don't use it -
Me : trying to sleep       My brain: If antman became smaller than atom how can he breathe
I pray who ever read this becomes successful.
Trevor: "No Human would find onions attractive" ... shrek's fans: excuse me sir?
😷
By time ...
"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour." Everyone who talks about an unproven conspiracy theory,  breaks one of the 10 Commandments. When God says neighbor, he means any other, for God all humanity is neighbor to each other.
There will come a day - not too far into the future - when people will regret calling for censorship.
Sarcastic people are going to thrive in the comments!
They don't need to change the laws...   they just need to enforce them
break up the banks while they are at it
ABOUT DAMN TIME
Negative comments like: "Donald Trump is becoming the super spreader in White House" should not be hidden.  It's scientifically logical to see him as a super spreader...why should reasonable and justifiable comments be banned?
I stopped using all social media except for YouTube a couple of years ago. It was freeing experience.
I don't know those onions look kinda freaky
breakem up and amazon needs to be government run service for the American businesses to use to distribute
Humans are implicitly biased Trevor you can never have a human monitor the content. You need better algorithms whose code is reviewed by a committee before being launched to ensure that it isn't biased. I think that's the way to go about it.
Why are social media companies banning Qanon?  If they are going to go that route they should also ban Antifa and BLM!
TWITTER! Do something!
I don't love using them, and I doubt many do. They're just the only feasible option for your average person.
You can't out-trump stupid, and you can't out-stupid Trump. #864511320
America is  23 in education. 37 in healthcare. 34 in raising family index. No high-speed train. Highest number of homeless people. Highest number of incarcerated people. 78% of people live paycheck to paycheck.  Stock market is not economy of Americans! Where 90% of money belongs to top 10% of the population, it's wallet for the rich.  Let's talk like adults, instead of name calling.  I have left the proof on my playlist, if you would like to check!  Let's make our country better together.
Why not ban proud boys too
I think we need an international seal of facts, based only on reviewed scientific publications. It could then be used to automatically filter out anything that doesn't have this seal, with submission review options. Then if some crap pops up saying the earth is flat or vaccines cause autism someone can be appointed responsability. It's high time all these social networks assume their role in information transparently.
Microsoft... like ... "yay not us again!"
4:29 The reason why they replaced the human with a bot was because people were becoming traumatised from the things they saw 😟
😷 BB's had that all the time...
The moon landing was obviously faked.
1st: you’re awesome! I love ❤️ what you and your team do! Shout out to The Daily Show Cast and Crew! 2nd: This question has nothing to do with the show, but I noticed that you shoot your segments in the same spot. As someone who is also working remotely, I was wondering, is that helpful with your workflow and scheduling?
decisions like this is why I no longer have a facebook account!
The smiling emoji with a mask looks like a pig with mask.
No cap Trevor is starting to look like The Weeknd
We still have anti trust laws. It’s the pro corporate anti people courts that ignore them. Nothing is going to change that unless the federal circuit is returned to fairness towards workers and customers. Unpack the courts Mitch has spent 12 years rigging in favor of wealth and against US
They know a new Presidency is coming and they need to get on board.
again muffled sound. no "s" comes through...
All those dumb social medias are BS these days, fb and Instagram shld just go extinct so many rules etc...leave sexy onions alone it's food! Caramba
Youtube: what happened to you guys?  Facebook: big tech monopolies like myself are being broken down.  YouTube: oh shit. I gotta go secure my account information ---  Twitter: -- we said BIG tech monopolies.
Facebook owns Instagram. Stop being duped. Oh wait! This is YouTube! Damnit!
So... Trevor had a rash once.
I don't get it  If ur gonna censor negative comments Does tht mean legal criticizms too will get censored Even though it's fair and legal🤔🤔🤔
Those are going to be used against anti-govt posts.
That is how it is supposed to pronounce? Kyuaenon? for god sake... i was just saying "KUANON"... nah...  it really does not matters... But hey... those people watch too much James Bond movies... and yes! we all dream about sexy onions LOL
How many horseman of the Apocalypse are there again? Nine? Yeah Let's go with that.
a friend of mine often reacts with emojis only. With a bazillion types. I understand about 3. Communication is often a metric ton of fun. more importantly, if a comapny is successful enough to become a monopoly, how do you tell the owners that you end/reduce their success at the stroke of a pen? "We take away a huge chunk of your company, because we said so + reasons." Or how?
I can't wait until you talk about the segregation that's happening on those platforms
Just make them pay taxes...LOTS of taxes.
Thank you for bringing much needed laughter to our suffering Nation. U, Colbert, Randy Rainbow are National Treasures.. You relieve anxiety, mind & body stress, by giving us a chance to laugh. A necessary buffer in this time of tRump-virus spreading again. Y'all should get together and do a "OUT" of School Special for our children not up watching Late Night TV but TikTok. They too are feeling depressed. Love U! 💘😍👵🏼
1:47 not true... that's not the only reason, they buy out the competition or block them through their monopolies like Google does with YouTube alternatives ... Get your facts straight Trevor
These companies are overregulating us on social media. It's awful and ridiculous.
C'mmon, haven't you heard about the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan? Why won't you talk about that?
This was awesome so funny. Great job of sounding sex deprived talking about an onion stripping lol. Nice to have some good news and laughs.  Have a great day and stay safe.
No rant videos about Harris Pence Dichotomy??? SAD
They broke up AT&T into baby bells, did it really help????
I love Trevor 😻
And Facebook says they will ban political ads.  Facebook might be bearable again.
💗
Does anyone have the address of the onions? ;-)
"Because no human, would think an onion is sexy."  You clearly haven't seen the Minato Aqua lewds.
Orange is sus, vote him out!
instagram gonna remove comments :v  wow snowflake
Watch Biden and Kamala not bother splitting these companies up if they win.🙄
sad pathetic people desperate for attention - today it's the yesterday it was the tea party - today it's the Q and tomorrow they will all worship a cabbage   - lonely sad ignorant people
That's kind of why I like masks. I don't have to pretend to smile anymore. I never liked fake smiling.
they're deleting it because they're hiding the truth!! /s
So again Qanon people does this mean trump is a pedo and the whole white house since they got the rona😂😂😂
Why won't they break up Telecom ?
About time Q anon groups were banned even if it's way too late. The group is now slowly crossing into becoming yet another Alt-Right hate/terrorist group with its followers already carrying death threats against actual random innocent people just for not being Trump supporters,, even more dangerous with some of them being in law enforcement (like that sheriff who blamed the fires on enemies of Qanon). Now if only the government banned people who believe in Qanon  from holding positions of power, but I guess is gonna take the unavoidable violent act inspired by this group fear mongering for them to take this Trump Cult seriously.
Awesome way to be spitting out my OJ this morning 🤣🤣🤣🤣😅 But seriously, with so much out of our hands, without humor we'd all be out here vaguely grasping at large, awkwardly shaped objects with our tiny hands like a Donnie no hands. But sure it's hard to put your mask on with tiny hands, Donnie.👀 We know the truth.🤣🤣🤣 I'm just trying to laugh and not feel the despair that comes with over 200,000 Americans dead and the world literally falling apart. 😭😭😭🤦🏽‍♀️
Better idea: the 'monopolies' would just be required to pay full share of 'un-loopholed taxes', no tax breaks or incentives anymore!
So cnn is able to slander and lie all over social media about trump but when qanon does it because it’s the opposite narrative then you guys freak out. This is what I call selective speech and taking people’s rights away. You sheep’s don’t even see it.
Agree with only highlights on IG!!
Trevor describing onions.. we learn something new everyday
"No one would think an onion would be sexy."  Buzzfeed articles: sweats profusely
Ok, but when will I get an emoji that's smiling and teary eyed at the same time, without laughing its ass off?
Q anon is the national Inquirer of the internet.
When will this happen to Youtube comments. At that point I'm gonna miss the comedy that happens there...
Lies and flies coming out of Pence's mouth. One even flew on his head to give him shit to say.
Wait till they figure out how much more monopolized semiconductor processor manufacturing sector is...what's it gonna take, another 10 years.
you crack me up man! glad you're here!
How long before just one Conglomerate decides to move its operations out of the US? Seems extreme ... but at this rate.
Seems like America is choking their neck by themselves. If GAFA is split up, Chinese companies are gonna take over the market of the world, which will enrich the power of China, and the economy, media, entertainment industry etc will be in favor of them.  Come on America, you guys are the last hope to fight against the communists. Don’t be an asshole.
lolol
Onions are hawt
Why don't we just keep them big...but tax really heavy (US has huge national debt so let them pay for it)....just a thought...they may want to break up
people still use Facebook?
So, Big tech is the moral gauge and the new way to take away our freedom of speech? Oh yeah, since freedom of speech is masked online; what happens when people talk in public? I would rather see messages flagged and something that says this comment may be considered offensive or demeaning. And, sometimes we just need to learn who to defend ourselves online or allow others too as well. Otherwise, since I guess parents, friends and family aren't speaking up, society is just going to get morally worse due to bad communication skills. Besides, everybody's right in their own mind. What makes someone righter than someone else? Catch22s of life.
Love trevor, he keeps real!!!!
I'm not anti-capitalist but yeah break 'em up.
Dang dude, this is scary either way! The fact you get punished for being successful or the fact their so big their countries are scared of them 🤷🏿‍♂️
You actually watched iPhones not including a charger? Man, You are unbelievable!
I took my cards off of my phone too much advertising
I wish Trevor Noah would stop 🛑 the cursing 🤬 completely unnecessary and feels out of place
yeah if someone is being a bully online just shut the computer off... hiding comments is bull
Time to whitewash social media.  People keep giving the government power that they were never intended to have.  Everybody knows this everyone sees it, but nobody actually wants to do anything about it.
Hey Trevor I don't know if you're going to read this and I know it's a long shot I was wanting you to see if you could help me do something special for a very special woman she is a nurse at theevandi Putney in Americus Georgia if you could find it anyway to give me a second to actually talk to you I just wanted to get a moment of your time it would mean so much to me because down here in a Little Miracles Georgia these nurses have been working so hard she's not only a nurse on the front lines she's a mom to 5 kids and she's just amazing if you could help me do something special for her it would just mean the world to me man so here goes nothing

I don’t like monopolies, But Apples software ecosystem is good .. It would be disadvantageous to break them ... for exampl: Imagine you have an apple ID and suddenly you lose iCloud because of Some policy.. You lose all the purchased Movies in iTunes and apps you downloaded and bought . Same thing would happen to android users , since android is owned by google . But , I’m using an iphone
No mask emoji = Dead 😵
It thought my car and my sons Xbox was sexy
Has anyone else noticed how much Qanon resembles the plot from the short story, "The Ten O'Clock People" by Stephen King? If you're gonna hate crazily, at least be original, dammit.
About time Facebook ... too late too little
Anybody else find it intensely ironic that the same people in Qanon saying that rich people kill babies in Satanic rituals... are also the same people who fight to keep those same rich people in power?
Qanon is a dangerous cult
Namuste🙏 from Ahmedabad India
Has Trevor completely misinterpreted the monopolistic treats for Tech giants or he just cover things up? It is all about personal data protection and nothing about free speach...
Selena Gomez Look what you made mark do, I knew the moment she uploaded that screenshot of your message to him something like this would happen, that's shit, you can't stop the truth!
👌🏽
I hate the American obsession with monopolies.  It dates back to colonial Southern plantations:  each slave made you enough to buy more, so the only thing stopping you from accruing massive, even absurd amounts of wealth was time... and we had to fight an entire _war_ to break those up!  Yet every Republican keeps fighting for the 'rights' of these companies that have a dangerously large sway over people's lives, for seemingly no other reason than because they like to dream maybe they'll be able to control lives like a puppet master some day too.  I guess, I honestly don't know what they're thinking.  It's nothing but a PowerBall dream, everyone pictures themselves as inventing the next fad or must-have and playing God.  Meanwhile I'd honestly be stymied to even figure out what to do with it if I had it.   Thank you for letting me rant once again, internet.  Thank you.
Random thought: I would love to see Trevor's Afro blown out. 😅😅😅
imagine Apple splitting up   Woah
Trevor!!!.lol
F..ck QAnon.
A random person who likes this will be a billionaire someday
A random person who likes this will be a billionaire someday
So much for freedom of speech u can't hide the truth paedophiles and fyi it's not conspiracy theory u should ask Jeffery Epstein oh wait how about Hillary's email and her campaign manager pizza gate and we can see through u trevor how u take the part about babies being eaten to make it sound crazy but ignore the part about pedophilia  wake up people this evil people will not stop until u catch and burn them

This is what happens to YouTube content creator being ban
Did we just see at the end Trevor Noah's ahweago face like he was impersonating bells delphin
Let's face it. This was coming.
Instagram: don't click this button 🤣
Kids 🙊🙉🙈
Rotfl 😂
Ok hear me out. It it a mere coincidence that a sexy onion and a rash on the crotch came up in the same video.... Or is Trevor hiding something 😅😂😂
Hell yeah! Something is actually going right!
the new mask emoji launched by Apple looks very chinese 😂
What the hell is wrong with the idiots in US government ? Breaking up big tech companies is the biggest problem now ? Who the hell came up with this ? Oh sorry I forgot its the same bunch of old ass idiots who don't even know which company makes iphones....Someone needs to get those grandparents our of the administration....Not only they are completely unaware about everything but they are just dumb
Speaks volumes when Facebook bans a conspiracy group.
History has shown us that breaking up monopolies is always a good idea, and allowing them to remain is always not.
That Onion Booty will make you Cry though.
Breaking them up won't solve anything.
Where ia the one about the VP debate ? I just wanna hear joke about that fly.
I really would like to see Trevor in a movie his acting skills have been highlighted during the pandemic
Q is a russian plot,
Hot Onions 🤩
M
.
Brazil already started downsizing Amazon, we're cutting it in half! Wait... different Amazon you say?
People are limited for choice? Not that they love them i do not use any  thing zuckerberg at all or AMAZON Getting off google and cautious about all net related activity
Oh my god those onions are so hot.
I can count on you Trevor to make me laugh to ease up the stress during this pandemic.
I don’t even know what is Qanon?
So much for the 1st amendment!  Once the censorship starts it will spread like a mold. 1st they censor someone unpopular than they will use it to cover anything they don't want you to see.
no dont take the only reflection instab**ches have left away from them.. in a year they all will think that they're pretty and that should matter somehow... how about hate comments get copied into everyones feed with the real name of the writer attached
Finally! Something good that facebook does.
Gotta flag those sexy onions... might attract ogres.
About fekkin time.
yo all i'm sayin is once you realize how this gonna effect your day to day lives you gonna wish this never happened and the stock market gonna make a hella of a day when this happens
“Break up big tech.”  Why did this take so long? Does no one remember Bell System and why it was broken up way back 82?
this sounds similar to the unregulated banks for home mortgages before the bubble burst and the us gov bailed out the banks, but this is the data mining area where Facebook just sells your info to 3rd party just like evry other social media.
Hmmm, but QAnon is not even a terrorist group, why ban them?
The Insta thing would be great to cover up hate messages that my soccer team regularly gets.
Brave.
There are definitely high profile pedos and child/women trafficking but those Q people think Trump is somehow come to save them.  You can’t even be a conspiracy theorist anymore without these Trump supporters ruining it.
Trevor ans onions.... I can never see Trevor the same way again lmfaoo
Natural selection is great right guys
I think Facebook just gave me a way to permanently delete my account finally!  I just have to put qanon stuff and they will do it for me!  Big 🧠 thinking!
When they broke up Ma Bell the owners just bought all the parts they broke up.  It gives them more control.  Nobody with that kind of monopoly is a law abiding moral citizen.  Nobody.
Yeah I think the facebook algorithm might have seen those "Sexy Onions" as a boob and nipple.
Came here for snark, stayed for sexy onions.
Onion Butts And Emoji still looks creepy
Did Trump even finish building that "wall" yet? Y'all remember, the one that he claims he'll  Mexico pay for but instead used our tax dollars for? Just genuinely curious.
that is all we have any more is monopolies and corporations. they put money in our politicians pockets, so it is unlikely any changes will happen
computers don't get confused. they did what they were programmed to do. This is why people have concerns over computers rising up and killing us because we tried to unplug it. This is a battery ad.
I'm thinking about selling aluminum foil hats on Amazon for QAnon members.
What are you going to break Apple into? Facebook? Amazon? Google is one of the few that actually can survive a monopoly, but if you look at market share, some of the companies in Silicon Valley (i.e. Apple) don't have any majority of market share. Congress is stupid. The only way to work this is by regulation, not the Sherman Act.  Source: My business and law major -_-
I mean onions are delicious...
Trevor You are Looking Awful sure Grandma would not approve of her baby looking like boy from the Hood? My handsome South African Boy is using more americanism ? To fit in ? WHY CAN YOU NOT BE YOUR CHARMING SELF, FROM YOUR ARRIVAL ? VULGER WORDS NOT NECESSARY. YOU HAD YOUR WIT--- SO WHERE HAS THAT GONE ?
"These companies are monopolies that need to be broken up"  Disney: "intensely sweating"
7:35 and thats how you create your OnlyFans account
I never heard of QAnon until a month ago. I don't use the "Facebook" it's toxic
I guess the money from Big Tech companies finally ran dry.  How else do you explain Congress finally getting off their butts to stop all these monopolies?
I think, most of QAnon followers are too lazy to move to another platform. So, hopefully the following will fizzle out.
Isn't their a senate hopeful that is a Qanon believer/supporter? Do away with that fucker too
QAnon is a "myth" like "antifa" but are these things what "you" tell us they are? hmmmmm.....                 gotcha
I legit had a dream last night where as I was waiting in a line to get into an auditorium, Trevor walked through, stopped at me and brushed my hair back. BEST DREAM EVER.
You cannot hire soo many people to monitor posts. Its too much data
It’s scary to think people out there believe in Q.
What happened to free speech, this a slippery slope we shouldn't be going down.
Is Trevor being gay on us now?
huh i just notice your hair
People still go on FB?
hmmm. Trevor, it may be time to examine if you really want to go in the neckbeard direction....
1:10 that's probably how google searches auto-complete themselves 😅😅
So. Early. Omg. I love u Trevor 🥰 So excited for your election coverage on November 3rd
We need big tech companies ! I work at Amazon!
0:31 DID HE JUST SAY OVERHAUL???!!
Trevor is in dire need of a haircut
Ban cartoons next. I don't trust the bubble guppies.
Wake and bake and Trevor. Good Morning.
i be early
Wow
YAY!!!!!!! Daily show is awesome!!!!!
Hi
hiiii I love your joke I always check your videos from Japan!
LOL this is just sad for those who live QAnon
🥰
8th
Love your sweatshirts..❤️🔥
I like... big... bulbs... and I cannot lie.
I think Facebook , Amazon, and Google should be broken up to pieces and pieces and turned into dust.
3rd
Don't you have a girlfriend now homie?? you still scrolling for onions? Just keep the Kardashians on your follow list, you'll have plenty to look at! Round... firm... and a strong smell!
