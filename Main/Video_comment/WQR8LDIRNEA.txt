well deserved destroyed the competition
Burnley are premier league ??😂
From a neutral fan here that was never a penalty!
One would expect the Burnley players or coaching staff will at least offer Kompany some hug or lift on their shoulders. Kinda strange they didn't and he was ostensibly looking for whom to hug.
Boehly watching closely 😂💀
First goal offside
They could literally just drink tea on the pitch the last 7games😂
6 fingers are back😊
All this to get relegated next season 😭😭😭
Massive props to Burnley, they were down but not for long ! Kings of the Championship !
Fair play to Burnley, you don’t have to have the best players to win in this league you just have play with grit  desire. Consistency is everything in this league and that’s what they’ve been. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Parachute payments are an advantage! Explain to me why I am wrong!
Big up kompany for leading Burnley to the premier league again. His first managerial job and he gets a team promoted way Early! Good luck to him and Burnley
Burnley played better than us, but there's no way that first goal should have counted. It was well offside. Boro have a very troublesome defence and BUrnley absolutely exploited it.
I'm a blackburn fan, congratulations Burnley you been class all season. No hate here love a Derby game but we won't be playing you boys for a long time I wouldn't think! Way you've been playing you'll be staying up! We've been up and down like a yoyo.
Burnley's winning goal has to be one of the most comedic goals ever scored. That can't be right can it? 🙂  It's as funny as watching a video of a seagull walk into a shop and come out with a bag of crisps.
Well done Burnley see your Monday and see you in the prem from Sheffield United fan
I’d like to see different angles of Burnley’s goals both looked offside by a fair margin
Sean doyce to get the Burnley job when there battling relagation next season
First goal was offside lol
Proves they were right to sack Douche.
Well done Conner swans give him away good luck in the prem
Congratulations and a big shout out to Vincent Kompany. Burnley are by far the best team i saw at St Andrews this season, absolute quality. KRO
UTC what a season we have had roll on next season
Congratulations must go to Burnley and Kompany for being able to return to the Premier League at the very first attempt.👏🤝👍  Guys who have been great centre backs often make a good choice for a manager and Kompany has managed to do so.  Best of luck to the Clarets back in the Promised land but for now simply savour the moment.
Burnley have been no less than phenomenal this season, Great job Kompany ❤
Ref should be suspended for giving that pen
Shame they willingly bent over for Citeh.
good luck to Burnley and captain Vincent ,, a folk hero at MCFC  and a hero at Burnley  . congratulations  !!
Well done Burnley well deserved you are by far the best team in the championship, coming from an ITFC fan..
Great season from Burnley tbf, that penalty was a ridiculous penalty, talk about a dive
Welcome Back
He be seeing pep in prem😢 emotional
That penalty decision was disgraceful lol glad Karma came their way
hate it whne players put their hands up to indicate offside. Borough did this every time burnley got the ball. Tossers
What an outstanding job Kompany has done! Wishing him a good luck for next season. He has revolutionized this Burnley team completely. Played some beautiful football lately!
This truly is the moment were Burnley became the premier league BRAVO VINCE
First goal a yard offside 🤣
Water is wet. Who didn’t expect this at the start of the season?  Another relegated parachute payment club back up to the Prem on the first or second attempt 🥱
How does the linesman miss Barnes being offside for the first goal? Is he blind? Also never a pen for Boro for me
Amazing to be promoted already, congratulations from Newcastle.
one of the softest penalties ever- refs continue to be clowns.
Congratulations to Burnley .
Vincent at Man City in a couple of years
Congratulations Burnley.
Burnley are back and they look like completely different team
Burnley did a great job. Unlike the person who wrote the title of this video
And getting relegated next season again
Well done Vincent Kompany. Walked into a rebuild job where he had to recruit half an entire squad which could’ve easily gone badly and seen him gone by Christmas (we’ve seen jobs like that before) but managed to get them up at the first time of asking. 👏👏
Cheated
Congratulations to Burnley for their promotion to the Premier League! It's amazing to see the team's hard work and dedication pay off. The Championship is a tough league to play in, and Burnley has shown that they have what it takes to compete at the highest level. I can't wait to see them take on some of the biggest teams in the country and showcase their skills. It's always exciting to see new teams enter the Premier League and shake things up. I wish Burnley all the best for the upcoming season, and I'm sure they'll make their fans proud!
Always great to see the little smoggie town get beat. Once they drop out of the play off position their crowds will drop to 10k again, very fickle as always….
Well done Burnley well done vinny. Absolutely smashed this division see you at the etihad next season. Unless we get kicked in to the conference 😂👍🏻
Greatest Championship team of all time.
Carrick v Kompany is quite interesting   Both have done really well
Same teams up same teams down every year... parachute payments have got to stop... it's unfair
Congrats to Burnley on becoming the Premier League
Congratulations Middlesbrough. Oops, my mistake, though they'd won the title way they celebrated that penalty.
I would love to see what Kompany can do to Burnley in the Premier League next season🔥
As a West Ham fan, it's nice to see a team in claret and blue doing well. Also my Aunt is from Burnley so it's good for her as well
Congratulations from Glasgow Rangers
They'll be relegated next year mon see 😂
Imagine Arteta wins Premier League with Arsenal, another success story for Pep Guordiola.. I'm an Arsenal fan but I appreciate good football, managers and success stories 👏 👏
I didn't know Sterling had moved to Burnley. When did this happen?
Atleast we know one team getting relegated next season
Easy money to be made next season. Back Burnley to get beat every game and 95% of the time you will be quids in. Congratulations Burnley on promotion and thanks for making me rich. This time next year Rodney, I'll be a millionaire
What a proud night for all Clarets UTC
Seems like Burnley needed that relegation.
Let’s hope Kompany stays, be interesting to see how they do next season..
You just know that big clubs are going to be hovering around Kompany like wasps around a beer garden pint. If he's still Burnley manager in 12 months, I'll be amazed.
"Greatest British league on the planet" 🤦‍♂️ jesus.
They deserve it great job Burnley
Well done Vincent and Burnley..been a great team this season and deserved to go up
I can already predict the future - relegation spot 10 games in, and Kompany getting sacked, Lampard drafted in to save the day.
One of the best supported clubs. Made up for you.
I'm  a Leeds fan.  Just wanted to add my congratulations to Burnley.  Probably the best side in the championship for years. Well done 👏
Congratulations to Burnley on becoming the entire premier league
@AFTVmedia - so next season 23-24 Arsenal will be playing Burnley Home & Away COYG's!
penalty decisions are getting so bad in the championship
Can't anyone spell at sky sports
Well done Burnley 👏👏👏
So boring seeing Burnley always go down but end up going back to prem
Massive congrats to Kompany. Let's hope he stays builds rather than takes a  "big" job and rushes it
That pen was soft
A Bolton lad. But all the very best...
Man City fan here burnley you will not go wrong with captain Kim pant leading your team. He will be our next manager when pep leaves. Congrats on a great season still 8 games left you boys are back in prem 👏👏👏
Kompany, legend
burnley are premier league? what happened there 😂
Playing gar superior football now without grizzly Dyche.
What a job from the players, staff and Vincent! Massive congrats wow
Seems Vin is now a 2 club legend
Someone was paid money to create that badly worded headline
Man City fan here, welcome home Burnley we shall welcome you at the Etihad 🫡
Nice one Vincent, nice one son!
First goal was off side
Straight back down next season.
Well done to the Burnley players and I hope Jake Hepple can go and watch in the premier league next season,the blades are also pretty much there now ⚔️✊🏻
They'll go straight back down the season after
Congratulations, and to Josh Brownhill, from a Bristol City fan
Cmon burnley
Congrats, Burnley. Well deserved!
Well done Burnley but have to say this good luck against United city arsenal
Can't wait to see the party mode at Turf Moor. Not even a Burnley fan but the way they work hard in football to win games has to be commendable both in the premier league and the championship. They don't give up and you have to respect that mindset as a fan of the sport. They might be a small town but they have big city dreams.
insanely soft penalty, especially for the championship
For people who watch the Championship and the PL, Pro-VAR or Anti-VAR?
The new "kompany" of troops have achieved their goal. Well done to Burnley!
Kompany would not have been anywhere near the top of my mind 6/7 years ago if you asked which prem player do you think would make a good manager
Fantastic job by Kompany, they play some great football 👏👏 From a United fan
Congratulations 👏👏👏👏
That was the softies penalty I've seen. More of that to come in the Premiership I suppose
Well done burnley
Congrats Burnley.   TBH I don’t get the hype around them, If they play the way they have done this season in the championship in the prem next year they’ll lose every game. It’ll be interesting to see what Kompany has in his locker to change things up so they’re more resilient and harder to play through.
Can't wait to see the mutants get pumped every week next season 💉
Pathetic dive, pathetic penalty, pathetic reffing. Well done Burnley up before Easter !
And back down they go lol 😅😂😂
Coming from a Middlesbrough fan, well deserved and I hope the boro will be following you to the premier league through the playoffs, Kompany and carrick have one hell of a future ahead of them as managers
Comiserations on your relegation next season, congratulations on your promotion a year later.
Burley are premium league.. Typical sky with their fantastic grammar
Congratulations, until kompany gets sacked before Xmas because there in the relegation zone
same teams always going up and down but tbf they deserve it
RICHEST LEAUGE??? thought that was the Saudi league
I hope Burnley have bad luck from here on out
Shame they'll go back down next season!
I'm not a burnley fan but just watching this gives me goosebumps i cant believe that kompany has lead this team to the championship title this early its just wow i knew kompany was gonna be a great coach but now i think he is up there as one of the best managers in england.
Well done Burnley glad you’s are back good team ❤ (Newcastle fan )
Burnley back in the prem where they belong, can’t say the same for Blackburn…
And they will go down again next season.. nothing to get excited about
With that squad i could have won promotion
Did they show a replay of Burnleys first goal?? slowed down he looks offside from this angle!!
Kompany is gonna be a great manger
Blackpool fan - well done the Clarets. See you in the Championship next season :)
Just in case other people were wondering too, Burnley need to win all 7 games to beat the Championship points record (106 set by reading in 2005/06)
That was no penalty but well done Burnly for overcoming. Thoroughly deserved promotion.
Wow big credit to Kompany and the players, first job in England and gets a promotion to his cv. Will be interesting to see them in the PL especially if Dyche’s Everton stay up 🔥👀
Welcome back from a Leeds fan.  Sorry about last season BTW  lol
Can’t wait to see how Kompany does in the PL, I think he’ll do well.
Well done and welcome back Burnley. Looking forward to Kompany's tactics each week come next season.
Sheff United fan here, Kompany has done an exceptional job and Burnley’s recruitment has been phenomenal, hope we can join them soon and look forward to seeing how they do in the prem!
Well all welcome them back next season
I hate how easy players go down in the box these days, a feather could land on an attackers shoulder and they'd leap onto the ground like they've been shot. Something needs to be changed...
Good job Vincent!
THEY WILL BE BACK IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP AFTER NEXT SEASON
Offside. What is the ref thinking?
Well done Burnley...
I say it almost every time but this is the worst commentator ever. Just irritating and cringeworthy af.
Very proud of what my home team have achieved,  well deserved
I think Burnley will permanently sign Nathan tella from Southampton
Oh great, Burnley are back
No disrespect to Sean but I found Burnley very boring to watch under him but that’s just his way of football I guess and like I said no disrespect towards him, but Vincent has got Burnley playing some very nice football so well done to them and I hope you keep this up for the premier league. Very well done 👍
Mark Goldbridge : “Always bloody Burnley”
Thoroughly deserved they’ve walked the league this season, congratulations Burnley.  Hopefuly we can join you but we need to build up some momentum going into these playoffs, starting on Monday ! UTB
Great to see Burnley will be back in the championship 24/25 ❤️
Quick question, how are they promoted with 6 games left?
I actually wanna see Luton or Blackburn in the prem as well
Kompany has a magic touch. Cryuffs influence lives on through pep and his influence lives on through Arteta Xavi and Kompany mental.
"If he had gone down, the defender would have been sent off"  Well done the young Burnley player for being honest.  So refreshing to see someone stay on their feet. Congratulations Burnley.  Well deserved promotion.   Good luck next season KRO
I think the ref could have brought play back and given a free kick when the lad stayed up after the shirt pulling and missed shot incident. For staying  afoot during a professional foul, reward a free kick there after the missed shot. I think.
Well done Burnley ... felt for yoos lot last session..But next session as i see it as 6 points for us Geordie boys...No mercy HWTLs
Wow city have another one
Well done Burnley ! Well done Vinny !
Fair play to Burnley both there goals were off side like and we should have had another pen. The refs and linesmen in the league are awful.
The highlights don’t do Boro justice... Could’ve walked away with a draw
well done Burnley your going to be a force to be reckoned with next season..
Glad Burnley won because that "penalty" was absolute filth by "all" concerned.
ONLY 2 POXY MINUTES OF HIGHLIGHTS COME ON SKY YOU'RE A DISGRACE, IF IT WERE MAN UTD WINNING PROMOTION IT WOULD BE 10+ MINUTES!!!
That's a hell of a tough league, so to wrap it up with seven games to go is some achievement, well done Vincent and the team👍
Properly  gonna get regaled in the pl
Welcome Back Clarets We Missed you. From Tottenham Fan
Make a bit of dosh then Straight back down
Shocking team Boro
As a luton fan ..i wanna say congrats..welldone to all players and fans .for promotion.coyh
Welcome back
Congratulations to Vincent kompany and Burnley and welcome back to the premier league
not a burnley fan however,well done and good luck for next season
well done burnley and vincent kompany,from a mcfc supporter
Ashley Barnes still gets games and I’m supposed to take this team seriously 🤣 number one team with a bartender up front
Nice to see Burnley back hopefully they can stay up next season
Good to see Burnley bounce straight back. Looking forward to them being a thorn in the side of the rich 7 once more.
f off boro! Come on Burnley! WE ARE PREMIER League!!! 🥳🥳🥳 UTC 😊
Oh yes, my favorite sentence, Bunlery are premier league. Makes total sense
Oh yes, my favorite sentence, Bunlery are premier league. Makes total sense
FMD Burnley, still 7 matches to play yet lol. also, that is the softest PEN you`ll ever see awarded..
Well done Burnley FC Congratulations for your Promotion, good job from Konpany and the squad, staff. You came back home early. Coming from a Man Utd fan 🎉
They won't survive the prem 😂😢
How god awful must the competition be for them to be promoted so early in a season during which they conceded six in the fa cup?
Congratulations Burnley.
Tella will be back at saints next season he’s a player we don’t have to sell
Great news, always loved going to Turf More, other half of my family are from the dark side. Looking forward to next season if (when) we stay up. Citehs next coach.
Congratulations Burnley well deserved promotion 👏 we will be joining you in next few weeks hopefully. From a Blade 🔴⚪️
Congratulations Burnley on getting promotion. Well deserved.👏 Hopefully we can get ourselves over the line now and join you. ⚔
I bet the Burnley fans can't WAIT to get back to being spanked every week 😅😅😅😅
Good on ya Burnley great manager.  Welcome back . Toon fan
Good to see this Burnley side promoted, many players there - especially Josh Cullen - are far too good to be in the Championship.
Where was the penalty for Burnley when they guy was grabbing his shirt? 0:29 The ref didn't see that apparently running behind them but did see the "nothing burger" and gave one to Middlesbrough. We need a better class of ref.
as a Blackburn Rovers fan I can say      f\888ers  lol
We’ll done burnely
As a leeds fan congrats to burnley. 100% deserve to be back in the prem
What have u done to Scott twine. Give him back.
Sheffield fan here thanks Burnley all we now need is warnock to put a weak side 😉😉 out against  Huddersfield at the end of season and the Premier is ours lol I'm expecting and kindly appreciate a respectful 1-1 draw on Monday
No way, this is a massive shock after 40 games and Burnley being top for past 6 months 😂😂😂 see ya back in the championship 24/25 season Burnley
Well done to Burnley to being able to become a league
Very excited and emotional players ..... thinking only about Premier league contracts ! 😅
*You'll be playing against the likes of Brentford, Brighton and possibly Everton next season. Must give you chills!*
Clarets back to where 20 King's Are
Kompany could very well go on to become an incredibly successful manager at some very big clubs
Hi
It’ll be really refreshing to see a Burnley side play some positive football in the premier league
Took long enough
what a Job Kompany has done, massive props to him and Burnley! looking forward to seeing how they do next year!
Congratulations Burnley and especially Vinny Kompany from a City fan
Hi
Well done Burnley u didn't belong in the championship x
They'll be back in the championship in 2 years 💀
The refs in the championship seem to get worse every season.
As a united fan I'm happy for Kompany,  was a class act and a top class player.
completely deserved. Burnley have played sublime football all season. Welcome back!
2-1 to be relegated and now 2-1 to be promoted lovely
Well done Vinny and the boys, see you shortly :-)
1 st goal offside
Welcome back Burnley 🙂🙂
Congrats to burnley for becoming premier league
Watch them sack kompany after 8 games and appoint big Sam, pulis or Steve Bruce 🤦🏿‍♂️
Congratulations to Kompany and Co❤
Welcome back Burnley, coming from a Liverpool fan
Let’s not get excited. Roy Keane and Keegan guided teams to first division titles in style and they didn’t last long amongst the elite. The life span of a manager in the prem is ridiculous
Welcome home.
Well done Burnley...welcome back 👏
Burnley ARE premier league!
please Kompany... dont let yourself get snapped up by a bigger club just to be sacked in three months. Give Burnley another season and stick with it ... for the record, not a burnley fan
Congratulations Burnley I am really pleased for your fans and players and manager are back in the Premier league
Congratulations Burnley, it’s what you deserve.
Grats Burnley, Top job Vincent Kompany... welcome back ;)
back to torment mark goldbridge
What really annoys me? When Tella is honest and fails to score in large part because the last defender has pulled him back twice. It should be a red card after the incident. It's nonsense that because he stayed on his feet he and his team are punished for missing. Did the player even get a yellow? Nonsense honestly. It's no wonder players go down when there's absolutely no reward and thus no reason for being honest. The Boro player made absolutely sure he got his team a pen by hurling himself to the ground. He wouldn't have gotten anything if he stayed up.
I started following burnley because of Scott twine. He hasn’t played much, but now I’m very invested in burnley and I’m glad
Winning the Championship is no guarantee of Premier League survival. Fair play to Burnley, but teams that play open and expansive football tend to go straight back down
Kompany to be sacked by Burnley before Christmas 🤶 👍😉
Wow I can't believe "BURNLEY ARE PREMIER LEAGUE"
Well deserved. Great club
Well done,Clarets!!
Congrats on promotion! I was a boro fan and I went to the match, amazing atmosphere!
Fodens looking after Vincent jr
What a rebuild and what a manager UTC
congrats burnleyyy
As a watford fan, congratulations on promotion 🎊 best of luck for the season ahead. You've deserved it
well done vinnie your a god....see you back at home where you belong in the future ,,,,once a blue
A Manchester derby proxy war
Hopefully passing Dyche on the way back down.
It was never a pen for boro
The fact that burnely are 11 points clear of championship with 6 games to go is crazy. Burnely deserve to be in premiere league
wow burnley back in the epl with 7 games to go wow what an achievement well done kompany
Good to see a proper Northern club like Burnley back in the EPL.
Well done vince
Luton next 👀
Great game
Both Sheffield United and Middlesbrough will join Burnley for next season Premier League.
Where did he get a hat to fit that head 🐬
congratulations burnley 24/25 championship winners!
Let's see how they adjust to the prem. Also curious what happens to Tella as he has got promoted to the prem but may be in the championship next season.
Big congrats to Burnley for their promotion and a massive congrats to Vincent Kompany for the superb job he's done in his first season at the club as manager. Well deserved to go straight back up
good to see them back, they play some decent football.
So good to see them back up In which got unlucky too get relegated last season
Commentator Name???
Wow getting promoted to get relegated again. Amazing!
vincent has the sauce
Back to haram ball next season😂
Welcome back
UNDERSTOOD
