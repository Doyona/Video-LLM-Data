Was it just me or did the foul look like a clear dive from Grealish to get City their 3rd goal😂😂
Cheats ?
Who’s holding Martin Tyler’s family hostage 😭
i dont understand how Ramsey didnt even go for a tackle yet its a foul because Grealish created the contact? also love when he did that for Villa it was never a pen top 6 bias
Is Grealish the most hated player in the Prem - ever!?!
Is the game that soft now that is the standard decision for a penalty what a joke the game is now
Easy penalty wtf
Why doesn't Pep like pace in his team anymore? Apart from Walker and Alverez... I wish I could get a chance to debate football with Pep! Buy Pulisic Pep!
Why do we keep letting grealish get away with his obvious dives...
Pep is naive sometimes, why didnt he play this team against spurs?
Why didn’t haaland take the penalty
Havent this lot been relegated yet?
where are all the city fans in the last clip? half of them left
Will 2019 to 2023 also be investigated.. They got caught cooking the books by shifting around large amounts of money, now they use multiple mock po box numbers to fund transfers. Relegate them as soon as the season is over. No sympathy for cheats
Villa are miles behind the class of Cities multimillionares, who can compete against a squad costing 1 billion?? And all genuine, honest Guv.....
Love how there’s no Man City fans in the comments do they even exist
Reporter : Whats you're best attribute?   Grealish : Diving
Imagine diving against you're old club?
why did gundo not pass to haaland if that was jack that wouldve been an easy assist and goal
And they question if its haaland that makes city worse lol. Stick that in ya pipe and smoke it
Tom Daley asking grelish for advice
They do realise arsenal have a game in hand right?
Could arsenal bottle it?
Haaland where are you?
Sky do realise that arsenal have 2 games in hand? 😂
