she does a few spit takes lol which one is the main part?
300 times for which was it?
12:50 what were you saying?
How is it possible for someone to be so cute and beautiful?
The “WHAT” after the question 😂😂😂😂
“ THANK YOU SO MUCH! … what do you mean??”🤣🤣I love her
does Sean ask her how it feels to unlive children?
Gal Gadot, a woman with a net worth of $40 million playfully asks, "Will you give me a million bucks?"   Absolutely adorable.
Does eating this every week have negative impact on the gutter
How many innocent Palestinians has she murdered?
How can a person be so impeccably beautiful!?
didn’t even realize that some rounds ended up being questions for sean rather than gal, that was so seamless 😂
Why such a freakishly huge distance between the two with two tables? That’s just, you know, weird and uncalled for.
How many children do you think she killed when she was in the idf
lucky you has anyone ever asked where the wangs come from? :P
Wonder Woman and Hot Wings, which is hotter?
I am trying to find how people  think she is good  looking!
All that murdering and she cant handle a couple of wings?
If someone asks me what’s your ideal girl type, My answer is simply Gal Gadot.😅❤
Ever see a women so hot it just makes you angry?
Did she bulldoze any Palestinian houses on the way to set?
How do you NOT have a million after 8 years and 15m subs?
"Did I ever tell you when I knew I was going to marry you?"😍 - Carlos Solis
Idk what is best if this one, Jennifer Lawrence or Rosé🤣🤣🤣
Did she have a accent ? I'm french so I don't really know how to recognize the accents but it's my impression, she doesn't sound like an statesian accent. But I know that even in US there is different accents so...
Is she acting😅
Who came up with the mac&cheese question? Brilliant! Now after you finished the wings, you get a price: a little bowl of Mac&cheese 😂
Why did you have someone who served in the IDF on?
Did she call Chris Robert??? Haha😅
I wonder if Wonder Woman can handle spicy stuff
When will these products be available in Canada? I can't find them!
wonder woman chickened out of da bomb ... what kind of nibble was that gal ... then spat it back out ....bring her back for a real bite
I always wonder how cold the wings are.
Why the tables still far apart? Idk why but because of that I don’t watch some of this
I've occasionally wondered what it must be like to exist in the world when you're that beautiful, female or male.
Good on Gal asking about Hot Wings' inception, and good on that Chris guy for having such an original idea. It goes to show, not every idea has been thought of.
I'm curious. Because she's from Isreal she was required to serve 2 years in the idf. Was that something that was off the table to discuss?
DONT UNDERSTAND WHY SHE DIDNT TAKE THE MILK INSTEAD OF SPITING IT ?
Sean Evans is the only guy in the business who’s questions make you want to give him a huge bear hug and then pound his face all at once.
How much for the armpit napkin?
Am i the only one that lost it when she spit like that?😍
Did Sean just pronounce her name wrong in front of her?
Rn convection milw wi Still waiting ask trump Where's my googles Hot Ones
Was she doing the water dance? LOL! Beautiful and talented Gal Gadot
the most beautiful guest diminished by Spicy Wings, why does she always seem to become more beautiful the more she suffers
Where is the iPhone questions
Carolina Viper is the hottest pepper in the world with over 2,000,000 Scoville, right?
I could be wrong but I question whether Sean is actually eating what they’re eating
Why won’t they put Da Bomb as the last one?  Most of the reactions come from Da Bomb.
15:09 😂 "what?!?"😂
Bro started askin bout isreali snacks💀
how do you sit there without melting with her infront of you
Interview wise this was very bad tbh. The questions were stale and meaningless. Though it was worth it watching her reactions to those spicy wings.
Who is this female?
I love how he asks the questions to distract them, and they do get distracted!!!
SO HOW'S THIS LOOSER GETTING THE HOTTEST WOMEN IN HOLLYWOOD TO sit there and eat jot wings. Can't be because he's interesting
Wait was she pregnant here? Lol
How to describe GG without sounding like a creep. It's impossible.
i love her and she is amazing and beautiful, but is she wearing a kitchen apron?
WHERE’S THE GREAT WONDER WOMAN NOW THAT ISRAEL IS KILLING CHILDREN IN GAZA?? 🤡
was a fan until I saw the kind of things the IDF get up to... now I have to wonder was it like that when she served?
How and why does she still look beautiful and attractive even when she's just spitting & puking everywhere???😍 I thought we were all created equal, this doesn't prove that.🥹😂
how can you not like Gal Gadot?
Gal Gadot is Miss Universe Israel 2004?!!! 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
"What? and you've done it 300 times?" can't stop laughing 🤣
At 8:56, what is going on with the arm & hand around Gal’s waste in the picture?? Does Elsa Pataky have arms longer than her body or what?? Ha! 🤔
Jennifer Lawrence is the best What does it mean
She’s brilliant. Dodging one question by asking the origins of the show.
It’s hard to say who I find hotter now ( no pun intended ) Gal Gadot or Megan Fox , I’m a fan of both 🖤🖤🖤🖤
Have you had top tennis stars like IGA Swiatek or Roger Federer join in on this show, even though they don't have anything to promote generally? Would you have to pay them to come on?
Is she even real ?
So doe she spit or swallow. That is the question
so how much scoville was the last one?  I prefer how the french version is done but kudos for creating that show ;)  also what did she say in hebrew? (didn't seem that hard or is it just me?)
I’m always wondering why only 10 sauces/wings and not 12?
How do you stay professional lol
Am I reading too much between the lines or it is kinda creepy that she is using all these references like "digging holes" killings and ''I'm not following you, I am going for it all by myself" and ''eating death" given she is super Pro-Israel??? It is just really creepy.
Why do they drink water? Doesn't that make it worse?
14:45 I love how the host tries to get her mind off the pain by asking her a question about snacks.
Bruh, why you using The Battle of Mount Valor for, it's everywhere.
What did Gal say in Hebrew?
How much for that napkin?
Imagine getting asked questions while you are fighting for your life with your mouth on fire.
of all the Hot Ones episodes this feels the most like a casual conversation to me cause she's asking Sean questions back almost the same rate as him like a real back and forth
Am I the only one who are willing to be spit out on the face by Gal Gadot 😊😅
Is Sean’s tongue insured?
Wait, new product - CHICKEN STRIPS? - Been wanting to try your Hot Ones wings for ages! Los Calientes, here I come!
12:27 My girl checking if she still has a tongue hahaha
the interview questions weren't really the serious type in this one
Was she this sweet killing palestanian babies?
I find it funny that so many people don’t realize just how normal some people are even after game. The way she was so happy taking the first bite of the wing to immediately answering a question with such a lifted voice. Also her “I love food” wiggles
😭😭😭 He asks such a serious question as shes drooling on table
yuck. having child killers as guests now?
What happened to -Explain that Gram- and The last dab being dabbed or not?
I just watched Aubrey. My question is why the 2 tables? Was it the Jewish separate thing? Or something else. No judgment though, I have read the bible and understand the law of Moses, sort of.
What’s up with double tables?
Can you please get Ari Lennox on here
No last DAB?
How can she snot a drink and look like this 16:30 craaazy
What’s the translation of the hebrew tongue twister?
how is she even real???? a pure angel to behold
"Are you ok?" (No, I'm eating hot wings with Gal Gadot. Not ok.)    I hope she never stops working.
Anyone know what kind of air force ones Seans wearing? 0:19
My favourite part of this show is how almost every guest asks "why are you shaking it" when it gets to the last one lol
Most guests ask who is Sean Evans. Gal Gadot asked how is Sean Evans.
Can we have Sandra Bullock, Sam Heughan, Channing Tatum, Catriona Balfe, Deepika Padukone next😉
I always enjoy Gal. Sean's questions this time felt less researched though.
maybe the worst of the woman's?
Why isn't da bomb the last sauce by this point...? It seems like it's the main killer..
so is there a part 2
Can you please get Tom Brady on hot ones
can we get uncle roger on the show??
Henry?!!! Do I look 👀 extremely super duper wings??!!’nn
spitting grosses me out. how am I still in love with her and disgusted at the same time?!!😂
Chris, when is it going outside US? EU, might wanna a bite as well
how is his tolerance not built up by now
this was entertaining but what happened to the interview questions? I feel like gal gadot just showed up and was like, guys we're shooting in 15min lol
Does she start singing Imagine after each pretend bite of wing? Lol.
I need Sean to tell us how much Gal spit on him during this shoot lol. It looked like she was really spraying it but I feel like she's the kind of person who would've immediately apologized for it if it happened, so maybe he didn't get hit.
How do u eat across from and angel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When is the next episode coming out, Sean?
Why she looked like Zlatan on thumbnail
I would get a ick when I saw people drink milk after having the chicken , I would always look at the glass of water . Is it only me !?😅
Can someone think about calling Rob Halford to the show?
Was Angelina Jolie ever on this show? I think it would be cool
Do they put just drops on the wings or bathe it
Can we talk about that perfect glass of iced water
Am I the only one who thinks she is absolutely unsufferable? She was condescending on several occasions to the presenter, and at some point borderline offensive to the other producer in the back.
The only thing I was thinking watching this is how can someone be soooo beautiful!!😍
Did she just put the hot sauce to her armpit? Hahah   Dont touch your eyes… then use armpit haha
Who was your first ever guest on First We Feast?
what do you mean!!! 20:37  😂😂😂😂❤❤
We ignoring the thread on the eyebrow?
What is it with Middle-Eastern languages that makes them so off-putting? They sound like someone is gurgling up their lunch while having a seizure. Such nasty-sounding languages.
At this level of spiciness, do you think "Mark Wiens" can pass it?
What happened to the last dab tradition?
Instead of performing and being the centre of attention she engages with and asks questions of her interviewer. Highly intelligent, multilingual, hard working, a devoted family woman, military servicewoman, actress, and dropdead gorgeous to boot.
What is she 37 or something? Man shes still ridiculously attractive
Pure Evil 13 million is meant to be the hottest sauce, are you gonna try it? Also I'd love to see Jamie Oliver on the show or Heston Blumenthal
can u make a shop or a supply in Romania ? i am a really big fan and i want to try all of them, the shiping is to much for me :(
Could you get the straw hat crew please ❤
Is she still talking?
Does anyone know what Gal Gadot was saying in Hebrew? (translated to English ;)
Is Sean red from the spice or becuase that's Gal Gadot staring into his soul🤔
Who's interviewing who? I think he asked her 3 questions.
When's the next show?? Is the season over already??
I thought her name was pronounce ga-dot, not ga-dough?
When Taylor Swift has time, can you do one with her❤??
Weak, did she even eat any? The Dabomb bite was microscopic.
I just love how the guests are dying and Chris is thinking "Now's a great time to ask another question!" lol Hey, Shaun, ever think of using boneless wings and forks?
Do a series that brings John Mayer back, followed by the other members of Dead and Company...
can  you get an African celeb on this show? BurnaBoy or Davido or WizKid
Gal Gadot thought "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" was only in Israel? Really?
Can you guys bring Anthony Ramos and Daveed Diggs on this show! I bet they won’t stand a chance.
Ask her about Snow White?
Any chance of getting Brennan Lee Mulligan or any of the Critical Role cast on the show?
barely asked her questions lol
Could you guys invite AJR onto the show? They’re three musician brothers and they are the funniest.
What does the tongue twister mean?
How can she be spitting and drooling everywhere and still look like an angel? 🤣🤣
I feel like not enough questions were asked 😂
Why is this video not ending?😂
CAN SOMEBODY EXPLAIN TO ME, WHY IN THE WORLD THERE'S NO EPISODE OF CHANNING TATUM DANCING ON SPICY WING'S🤣?
“Thank you so much!….. what do you mean???” 😂
Can somebody tell which wafer she talked about @16:30 ?
Hello sean evans, is it possible to bring joe la puma of sneaker shopping ? Thanks and thank you
does anyone know where her cartilage earring (w the green stone) is from? gorgggg
Was this the season finally?
I saw this and am thinking "Do I have an armpit fetish?"
How on earth can a woman be so beautiful!? 😍
yall still keep the red hankerchief?
Why are they sitting so far apart in this episode?
Love Hot Ones. Can you go back to one table? The two tables and distance between is awkward.
Is Timbaland involved in this? That voice in the back reminds me of him.
Has Ed Currie been on this show? 😊
Why are you inviting ghosts to your channel?
How is Gal Gadot always so graceful? Even when she’s sweating, spitting fire and etc…? I am inspired.
No "Last Dab"...did you forget to inform her?
are the hot ones chickens available in Canada? if so which stores
Could she be sexier? Could she be more photogenic? Could she be more striking? No.
Is she a member of SAG AFTRA? This is a movie promotion, right?
🤔 i thought SAG members weren't allowed to promote projects during the strike
She literally distracted him on  Da Bomb, and missed a question to ask her; usually he asks them something important between Da Bomb; and she remembered to answer at last!
Wow, with such incredible questions and research as always, I'm kind of surprised Sean mispronounced her name. She's used to it by now, I'm sure, but it's kind of hillarious :D
She's balding ?
I give my bow and hats off to Gal Gadot, such great people skills asking about how this phenomenon started and making a great interaction 🤌👏👏👏
Gal drooling and spitting up everywhere made my day.  What was the brown liquid that was also on the table?
uknowhatimsayin?
Did she do the last bump? I didn’t see it  One of your best guest  ever ! She is the bomb and I don’t mean that terrible hot sauce 😊🐶🌸
Y is she in all black? did she lose someone? :C
3 wings per question I like it.
Does she get asked a question about MBKHD and the Twitter blocking?
I have to say I miss the one-table period... why not going back to that? it allowed for a nice interaction with your guests I thought...
is there vegan episodes?
Is it driving anybody else Crazy that she doesn't eat with her mouth shut
did you ask her about Huawei?
Can we get Robert Irwin on the show?!
"Thank you so much! What d'ya mean?" lol
Did she do spit takes while in the IDF?
When are you going to have "TheReportOfTheWeek" on the show. I would absolutely love to see him on the show tbh. 😊
Next andrew tate?
Love it so much when guests ask Sean questions and get him more involved! Gal is amazing ❤
Hot wings, hot question , hotter guest.
Can you invite Andy Samberg to your show?🙏❤️
Ask her about palestine
Why didn’t anyone tell her not to wear black???! She looks like a floating head.
17:24, how has she not aged?  Speechless.
You should asked her about supporting groups that pratice ethnic cleansing against the people of Palestine.
How about Jennifer Lopez to try this challenge?
I beg can you interview corey slipknot please❤
Where's the "last dab???"
how is she still so awsome even while drooling XD loveee her!!!!
“We’ll which one is it bb, spits or swallows… hahaha….. 😳”   -Austin powers
I wonder if Sean has always been able to with highly attractive people with no problems.
Can i be Gal's spitting bucket?  or the tissue/s she used?
Why she still so gorgeous ❤
How did Sean not cream his pants around Gal
Ask the guest to lick salt if it burns too much. Love from India
Tf is she wearing lol thought it was Batman fr
Why are they sitting so far apart
How is she so hot and such an amazing personality? 😮
how can someone look gorgeous even while spitting!! like omfg!
Does Gal Gadot play in any movies that aren't from recycled ideas?
QUESTION ? How do i get your products in Canada...cheers
is hot ones wings available in Canada ?
It’s the show with hot questions, even hotter wings and EVEN HOTTER WOMEN.
Pls tell me that they save the napkin......that Gal uses to wiped her armpit😐
Cool, cool, now ask her how she feels about apartheid?
Why is that the subsequent sauces aren't as hot as DA BOMB despite the higher Scoville level?
Wait... Did she not last dab?
So how many wings did she get down? It's like they just forgot about them half way through? lol
What does TBA mean at the Scoville level?
Why does she have to keep saying that her tongue is sweaty? Is that a translation thing? Because I think I'm uncomfortable. Or maybe I like it. I'm not sure.
How come I haven’t seen anyone translate what she said at the end ?
Waaaaaiiiiitttt a second. Does this mean they crossed the picket line? Isn't this LITERALLY against the rules of the strike?!?!?!?
the questions were weak on this one, by the end I was hoping he would ask about Jenin
The snack question after Da Bomb. Brutal. Gal Gadot is a beautiful woman.
How does this man get to sit down with beautiful celebrities every week? You got the coolest job in the world man. Gal can take the heat
i wish there were more questions in this one... got a little bored in the middle
I’m surprised that a lot of the guest don’t watch this show. You can tell when they ask “how he started hot ones?” Or “what are you doing?” When he shakes the last dab.
HOW does she make eating chicken wings so attractive 💀
Why are they 2 tables apart?
Was that the gal that did that obnoxious imagine-song for poor people?
Have you ever seen a human being spitting and drooling and being overwhelmed so gracefully?
Does it seem that Sean is forgetting to ask as many questions as usual?
I don’t get why they’re still using two tables as opposed to the single table prior to rona…
This one is more like Gal interviewing Sean
She's gn'treat but why did she wear black? Kinda obvious she hasn't seen the show.
I thought celebrities weren't allowed to do interviews during the strike
Super random, but Maddie Ziegler could play her daughter cuz they look so similar to me
idk if all that spitting was necessary
How is she so perfect?
I thought Actors are on a strike, why is Gal Gadot is able to promote her movie tho?
Was Sean nerfed this season?
haha if you didn't knew she was from Israel you can realize it pretty quickly she starts asking about money and how this business works
She asked the 2nd question 🤣 only Gal Gadot can do that
Has Steve Carell ever been tortured here??
But, also, Sean is absolutely ruthless with the questions!  Gal drooling, completely out of it, head on fire, "So... are there any tasty Israeli snacks that more people should know about...?" Gal, "What... the f... are you talking about, Sean??" 😂
This was fun but he usually makes great and interesting questions... Not this time
How can she even look beautiful even it's so spicy????
I love it when they get to the last wing and ask Sean, “Wait, why are you shaking it?”  Almost as if he’s about to hurl a hot sauce hand grenade at them. 😂
Are the wings kosher?
@6:30 gal asking if there was going to be a big jump in spiciness 😂
Can we please have Gal on again? I feel like there’s more left to squeeze out.
Why would she wear all black to an entirely black set?
she looks different...  did she have a nose job?
Did he ask about the “Imagine” video?
Do you guys only interview actors? I'd love to see some musicians like Lzzy Hale or Amy Lee on here!
If Gal removes her coat in front of me??? I’d be sure dead in a heartbeat 😍 gosh i’m inlove with her
Some of the most boring questions that one
I need to know how much Jennie of blackpink would resist 😼
Has Adam Driver ever been on here? I would love to see Adam Driver on this show
What do people see in Gal "Imagine" Gadot? She's so bland.
Am I the only human sweating and feeling the heat while watching them struggling? LOL
Dominic Toretto lifted up a car, can he lift up the hottest sauce? 🤔
I'm somehow always entertained by a guest asking why Sean is shaking the last bottle. It never gets old
Her right eyebrow darker than left? Or lighting?
Isn't there a spit bucket on the other end of the table?? lol
Only an Israeli would ask if they are 50/50 partners 😂
Is Gal not part of the screen actors guild? Or was this filmed before the strike?
Was that a date?
Absolutely gorgeous woman. How'd you do it Sean?!
what did she say in Hebrew?
Is a journey for real... to the bathroom.
It always makes me laugh to see how Sean follows up da bomb.  Gal's over there dying, strings of spit streaming from her mouth, struggling to breathe, and he just jumps right into a question about Israeli snacks. 😂
Have you had David Goggins on here?
Where are the questions Sean?! you skipped at least a few :D
How has this woman got so far on so little talent? The world really is made for the beautiful isn’t it?
Hey Sean if you have left eating chicken, what are you eating?
You should get nardwaur and exchange questions after each wing
Man is it me or she has the sexiest smile?
Shawn? Bit smitten ya think? You’re like a kid in a candy store!😜
Was is so difficult to learn how to pronounce her name correctly?
Please tell me someone has made 16:05 into a gif.
How do you not love Gal everywhere she is.
Did anyone else notice that she says her last name with an actual T at the end unlike every other time ive heard it from someone else sounding like "Gadough"?
I wonder if these wings are hotter than the ones in Themyscira 😭❤️
What’s up with Sean he looks bloated. And his eyes looked teary and crossed.
Loved this, but at some point I felt Gal was interviewing Sean and he only asked her like 3 questions, which is sad because I loooove his questions !
why are there 10k dislikes ?
Was there a last dab, or did the editor leave it out by mistake?
Can we get the  one table again?
why they sit so far away from each other ?
Who?
Seriously? The zionist?
What’s the worse thing about prison, prison Mike?  It’s the chicken wings
How can she look that radiant despite that spicy chicken kick?
how much for the spit ? asking for a friend
She’s not striking?
how in the world she still looks so beautiful while drooling 😢
Who?
Not sure where to buy your hot ones stuff because no Walmart around where I live in oregon sales it.
Is it me or did Sean not ask many questions in this one?
aren't actors not supposed to be promoting their movies at the moment?
When can the 6 foot distance be removed? Covid is over. Get closer.
My only question Gal is whether it's true that you're doing Wonder Woman 3 or not.  The DC Universe ruled by James Gunn seems to disagree with you.  So are you bullshitting or what Gal?
The lightning in a bottle isn't just the format it's the questions Sean asks. General interviewers are boring - they never do research, they have no idea about the guest. Sean catches them off their game some times which is nice
What did she say ???
She's Hebrewish?
Wait what? She looks so gorgeous even when spirit and drolling, I'm womanly jealous!!!
Why are the comments so weird when there are female guests 😕
Just a request how about Tim Tebow, Brian Urlacher, Javier Baez. Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo, Martin Lawrence as a quest just to name a few
Ya'll still got those napkins? lol
She's someone that I can't tell if I love her because of who.she is or because of how much I love Wonder Woman.
Has busta rhymes, shermar Moore or tyler perry been on hot ones!!
I always wonder - if the least spicy wing was on the left, the guests wouldn't have any issue 🤣 production - why start from right? when most people automatically reach to the left for first things 😅😂
Can you guys bring on Melissa Barrera???? Sam from SCREAM???
20:36 "Thank you so much!... What do you mean?" 😂
I want to know where the episode with Chris is? Eat the pain that created your success and let’s hear the long story of the of a great idea! If there is already this episode please let me know number.
I love that she asks questions too!
How are Sean's intestines doing? Does he prep in any way for these?
Can we get someone to interview Sean please???
Mac and Cheese with a touch of sweetness? I'd had to buy it to try it, she didn't not sell it lol. ❤
Gorgeous woman but dull answer's to the questions.
Why does his eyes always red and watery?😂 It's like he is always affected by the peppers even before eating it! Ain't he supposed to be used to it yet? Gal is such a cool person!
How can someone go threew such  torture  but look so hot at the same time
To see the Gal u wonder about jump to the 10:00 minute mark.
How is someone that fine!
Sorry, just starting the video, but isn't it pronounced ga-dote?? 😅
He got in, like, 5 questions. 😂 No in-depth Nardwuar moments, but a genuine person-to-person journey and connection. Way to call the audible, Sean.
how tf she handles this so good ? 😂😂😂
Can someone at Hot Ones please address whether this was filmed before July 12th when the SAG/AFTRA strike started? This is considered promotion for a company SAG is actively striking against.
what kind of AF1's are those?
So, I’m wondering how the strike will affect this show. Since actors can’t promote their movies as part of the strike… where does this put the show? I know it can pivot pretty easily, as they can bring on music guests, but still, I wonder…
Has David Beckham appeared before?
I miss de deep questions where the guests are suprised of the research. als maybe add a pepper at the end xD
She’s so sweet asking Sean questions as well and about the show
Am I the only one who found Gal's spitting out the wing / drink disrespectful? Idk it was new to the show. 😂😂
What happened to explain that IG?
Compared to the usual interview questions Sean comes up with, this was fairly generic.  I wonder if gal's background team had some restrictions on what they could and couldn't ask.
Anybody able to translate the Hebrew for me please?
If you ever wondered "does Gal Gadot spit or swallow?", now you know hahahaa
Tortit out of all of the Israeli snacks???
How is Gal Gadot so freaking adorable?! It seems like she has the heart of a child and is so kind. I’m in her corner, every project.
Can you get Brennan Lee Mulligan on the show??
The war criminal?
Can you get rid of the 2 table format and go back to 1 table?
is justine timberlake in this show? or the host is him?
Can you make them vegan too?
Bruh how does Sean  not fan girl with all the beautiful celebrities?!
man i dont know if id rather have that napkin she spit in or BE that napkin she spit in...
Is it just me or was she channeling  Sebastian Maniscalco at one point 😂
Whens Taylor Swift gonna show us what shes made of?
Why are there two tables? I swear there's normally just the one?
Anyone else just know her as the woman in that cringe covid video?
I thought that doing any sort of promotion isn't allowed during the strike?
Bro how could you not love her
Can we make Gal the new "Barbie"?
Thank you so much! What do you mean? Another memeable moment hahaha
No Last Dab?? but anyway I love Gal Gadot!!
*gal gadot seemed so cool on movies but irl she is so annoying and boring, is it the language barrier?*
Why ain't Sofia Vergara here yet ?
show with hot questions, hotter wings and even hotter guest
Can I catch her drool with my face? 🤔
wow. Not one interesting question and not one interesting answer. Surprised how dull this episode is..
Why is she interviewing Sean?! :D
I wonder what phone she uses on the daily
Time go get Chili Klaus back to see some finger snapping??? And to see Sean suffer 😅
Editng the last dab ? 😅
Imagine there's no spicy, I wonder if you can
did they accomadate Gal's dietary restrictions and replace the chicken with palestinian children?
I wonder why anyone haven't switched plates. He just too calm eating all that spicy heat. I keep thinking that his plate is not spicy. No reactions. Love the show.
Why does Sean look weaker and weaker these days???
How is she so fine
Am i the only one who never actually sees the sauce on the wings?
Does anyone know of an actually good role she's had? Because I've only really seen her as wonder woman and oh good god those films are such a freaking train wreck
Not Tom Holland, what about Eddie Huang who martyred himself.😂
how is she so pretty even when spitting xDDDD
what about the strike? hmm? bad look.
Why are you shaking it?
Why are there so many dislikes ? 🙄
Hot Ones - It's the show with hot questions and even hotter guests.
How does she look so great going through so much bad?
What's with the man clothes?
Where do I recycle Gal's armpit tissue paper? Asking for a friend.
*How many fell more in love?*
Yo, what's with the Complex Networks logo at the end? @2023 BuzzFeed Media Enterprise, Inc. ?  When did this happen?
Can I buy you guys a table? So it doesnt look like you scrambled to setup a coffee date... 😄
Sean def missed at least one question. I feel like he missed more than one. How does this happen?
Can you make Marcus Brown and Gal Gadot be in one room please and yes I know? .For a better tomorrow😂 😊❤
She’s so fascinating and all we want to know are: which fighting sequence…, which snack…whaaaaa
Can one buy that Gadot armpit napkin? Asking for a friend .😂
So, uuhh... how much for that red napkin?    *giggity!*
14:47-15:00 😂😂what was that?!
I love Gal in every way but… am I the only one who was a little disgusted with all her spitting and drooling? I mean, she’s an elegant and glamorous woman and I know she’s just a human being and all that but she started acting like my mechanic 😅
Anyone got aroused when she started drooling? Not me tho, i ain't a creep.... 👀👀
How about Henry Cavil, RDJ or Chris Evans next :)
Not many deep questions, first half went so fast
I scrolled for a bit and didn’t see an answer. What does that Hebrew “tongue twister” translate to in English?
Typical Jewish just asking about the money
why are there so many dislikes on this video?
Why is she allowed to do this with the actors strike going on? Can someone explain?
Why do they still sit so far apart?  Makes no sense
I think Sean answered more questions then she did
Is Sean the next Larry King? It's serious question.
“thank you so much, what do you mean?” 💀
😬 Is this enough?
And... What happened to the good questions? Gal Gadot made you nervous?
Did she put the dab on there?! I don’t think so 👎
am i the only one who could have sworn she’s done this before?
I like how she kept asking how Sean was doing with each wing. You can tell that gal genuinely cares!
why are his eyes so watery from the first wing?
What do you mean? Woman is genius!
Where's the last dab dabbing!?
Taylor Swift has yet to do Hot Ones? Might mess with her voice during tour season.
Was she doing a bit?
Did Shawn just stop asking questions? lol
So did she film this before the actress strike?
Is it just me or is Sean fan girling a bit?
And Gal Gadot's next comedy film will be...?
Why does she try so hard with her fake american accent? Lol total turn off
Bro can Sean pls get Antony Starr on here i would love to see homelander handle some spicy wings
can you please ask for rooney mara?
Can someone deepfake Arnold Schwarzenegger's face and voice onto Sean? For some reason I feel like it would be so much better.
new film?
how do they apply the sauces to the hotter wings? I want to do this challenge at home
I guess this answers the Spits or Swallows question…
Gal what’s worse this or מרור בליל הסדר?
Can you get Johnny Scoville on the show?
How does all of this work regarding the strike? Was this film before or is she doing this during the strike?
Is it just me,  or does there seem to be a lot of chemistry going on here?
Does she speak a second language her English is good
She is not a very good actress. Is she not a member of SAG or is this a banked episode?
Ummmm. I’m confused how at 40 years old, watching Gal describe Harry Potter while dancing in her seat makes me feel like I’m going through a second puberty. And there’s Sean sitting there, being awesome like always
What makes her think that spitting is cool to look at?
cool. now ask her about Palestine
I was looking forward to this one, but it seems like Gal was having to ask most of the question because there were so many pauses. I got bored half way through and stopped watching.....
Idk who half these guests are... but ima watch it
What? No last dab??? Or did I miss something?  And no Instagram deep dive anymore?
doesn't promoting a movie go against the strike rules?
300 episodes translates into 3,000 hot wings for Sean… how does he still have a stomach??
What spicy wings?
What's a really good snack in Israel? Gal Gadot: WWWWHHHHAAAAATTTTT?
Can’t tell if he’s doing the breathing thing to calm his beating heart or reduce the oxygen for the heat ..
How is she drooling and still so gorg?
Am I the only one who thought she was eyeing Sean like another chicken wing at a few points?
Who?
Did they dab the last wing?? It seems like they didn't dab. But I don't care, because this episode rules!
Ayo, yall have a dog? I can bark and lap that slobber and tea up 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Is it just me or is she kinda pretty? Asking for a friend😁
How much for the pit napkin?
One of your questions should have been "What's your issue with the people of Palestine and why do you support the Israelis who illegally occupy Palestinian land?"
How tf can he keep his composure with her just looking at him 🤤
ask her about israel's apartheid against palestine!!!!
Never saw Sean miss questions to the guest.  Interesting.
I wonder if Sean's stomach is okay after hundreds episodes 😭
Anyone know how I can get that tissue she used on her armpit. How much 😂
With the strike going on isn’t this considered scabbing
I am confused.  Did she have to do this?
What did they say at the end?
how many chickens has Sean consumed over the course of hot ones?
I always wonder if Sean ever experiences social anxiety… If so, how he mentally prepares and navigates it while in the presence of so many public figures. Sean, if you ever see this, you’re the best. Where my anxious day ones at? 🥰🥲
Sean was beet red before question 1. But then again so was I.
What happened to the last dab? I haven’t seen it for a while.
Video idea pitch: Y’all should do a tryout episode where Sean teaches a substitute wing host, there could even be contestants and someone would get to host the nest ep while Sean is on vacation or something, or maybe they just win like a wing and a question of the next guest. Sean sounds tired of these wings and needs a break, so tag someone else in for the next bomb or something like that
Eek is everyone here breaking the picket line?!
Is it just me or did Sean forget to ask questions for a while
Gal Gadot does a what??
Can we get some Johnny Scoville on this show?  That would be interesting
Why does Sean repeat himself so often?  I’ve never seen anyone else do this.  He is a fantastic interviewer, I don’t mean that as a slam, I’m just curious.
Israeli Snack?  Palestinian children, maybe?
Good question is sean ok?
Isn't there an actors strike?  When was this recorded?
Should ask Gal Gadot why she is an apartheid sympathiser that legitimises setteler-colonialism and state-sanctioned/sponsored terrorism.
How can that woman be that gorgeous? How is that possible?  Jeez.
Is she promoting the film? Can she do it?
You should start getting YouTubers on maybe?
Anyone know how to spell that Israeli chocolate wafer?
Asking Sean if he’s ok is so underestimating the challenge 😉
I feel like Sean was a little off his game with this one. Not nearly as many in depth questions. Maybe Gal is hard to get info on, I dunno. But I feel she asked him as many Q's as he did her.
How much for the paper towel? 👀
How could you sit across this woman and not fall in love.
What's her number❤
I gotta wonder if Sean is sick of chicken wings after so many years
It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings and today we're joined by Gal Gadot who is super hot herself 🔥
Why do they still ask "why are you shaking it?", don't they do any research on the show before hand?
No last dab!?! Did I miss something?
Woh~   The questions and the wings aren't the only hot things at the table.
Spit? Drool? Add no gag reflex, and it's the perfect woman.
WHERE IS THE LAST DAB
she,s  flirting with him right? is she single? i like these 2 together.
Who has a Mac and cheese brand?
Was she cursing Sean's existence in Hebrew?
where is John Cena or Dwane Johnson or Vin Diesel. Get them in there.
Is it just me or are actors not supposed to be promoting movies and shows right now?  Is Gal not in the Union?  Or was this filmed before the strike?
TBH, I don't see what is so beautiful about that gal?...
Is it just me or has The Last Dab been TBA since like Season 1? 😂
I wonder if any of the Palestinian children who are starving due to the economic and material embargoes imposed upon them will see the irony of Gal suffering while eating spicy ahi Ken wings.
What a weak contested 😑
Does Sean even believe this is his life? She’s so gorgeous.
Will u do the chicken strips with Apollo hot sauce?
I wonder how long Sean can keep this show until he gets the worlds biggest gastric ulcer. His poor organs 😢
Can you get Andrew Shultz on here please.
Why this is gold is when he goes into the question so nonchalant and they're over there dying, and then always like, "What?" Also at the end she pronounces the "t" in Gadot which was so interesting to me, now I know!
Let's see if Gal is truly graceful?
"Why are you shaking it?" is my favorite question each episode 😂
Did she not dab the last wing? That's disappointing =(
So was this shot before the strike? **Just read the info section 👍
Is it weird this turned me on?
this show has been 8 years but i'm curious why they still not wearing plastic gloves since that sauces is very dangerous for the eyes 😅
He didn't ask the question many times😂
Is it just me that thinks she looks like a boy in this😭😭😂😂
I'm sorry.... am I the only person that noticed Sean only asked her a question every other round???
The Mac and cheese question was excellent!  She made it a long way.    Things turned a corner at Da Bomb.  Her eyes exploded!
Can you guys please get rid of the two table aesthetic? One table! This looks so contrived.
Why is the table between him and the guests so long now? Kinda makes it feel less personable
is it me or sean skimped on the questions ?
What a charming young lady. I wonder what she thinks about apartheid.
Huh? I thought it was pronounced /ga-dot/ not /ga-doh/? They do so much research that Sean MUST be right, and she didn't correct him, so... huh. OK
Correct me if I am wrong....but is she the first to not do the last dab???? Oh no!!!
Challenge accepted!
what do you mean... lol loved it
Wait, what were they talking about?
is it weird i can really feel it my son loves heat i am a sweet and tangy i feel Gal's pain
so are they selling those Gal Gadot spit nappikns, asking for a friend😶
For next season, can you PLEASE try to get any or all of the following guests on: Sebastian Vettel Lewis Hamilton Daniel Ricciardo Gunther Steiner No particular order on any of those, I'd be happy with any of them tbh.
When are you going to go back to a single desk? It was more intimate, I liked it better...
You’re watching hot ones. It’s the show with hot questions and even hotter guests!
Why so many dislikes? Is there some sort of controversy surrounding her?
Will this be the final season? 😑
why does this even have 3.3k dislikes?
She does a what take?
Seems like there weren’t really 10 questions on this one?
My goodness... did she somehow get more beautiful?
Was her turning down the last dab edited out
Why wasn’t there a last dab?
How can you reduce the most beautiful woman on planet Earth to a drooling, spitting mess? I loved it! And you had the class not to even mention the last dab so you wouldn't increase the pain for this goddess. Great season! Can't wait!
What did you do this morning? Interviewed Wonder Woman.   😮
She is so stunning that Sean almost asks no questions. Watch all of his episodes, this is the least questions he's ever asked
Where is CC when you need him? 😅
WAY TO GO GAL!!🔥🍗🔥👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Can You Please Translate That Hebrew Tongue-Twister?🙏💖
Is anyone gonna talk about the anime references in the sections of the video.
who is this woman? i swear theres always random people on here
If only she performed like this in her movies, she'd have an award. Sean only got to ask her 5-6 question overall, because she kept behaving like this was a chat rather than an interview. Inane chitchat galore!
I'm not sure which is hotter? the sauces or Gal Gadot?
I wonder how bad these last eight years have wrecked Shaun’s insides….Hopefully this isn’t taking years off his life lol
Can you send me her wing scraps? Thanks.
Was she the first one to puke on camera?
How could Sean sit across from a beauty like Gal and not melt
asking the question right after da bomb was insane......pretty much like gal was dying :D  probs sean, i think no one dares to go on like that as you did in a intterview
How is she so elegant till the end 😂
Wait…does the actors strike not affect Hot Ones? She’s technically on promoting her new Netflix flick? Unless this was recorded before the strike? Anyone able to clarify?
How can someone be drooling all over the place yet be so unbelievably charming? great episode!!
Is Gal not SAG-AFTRA? Thought actors couldn't promote their films.
The show with hot questions and even hotter guests
I will never get tired of the guest asking why Sean Evans is shaking the bottle of the last dab
sean has never asked so little questions in any episodes before, she too fine
Fantastic but I didn’t see the last dab.. what’s up with the what’s up
What do you mean!!? Ohh she''s funny!
Has Kate mckinnon ever been on the channel 🤔 not that I've seen but ain't seen every episode and I think she would make a brilliant guest as would Bill Hader..
How can someone eat a chicken wing beautifully?
out of curiosity how much are you selling the napkin for LOL
Is it me or Sean is red in this episode? 😂
how are her underarms so light ???
How can this men act so professional in front of this gorgeous Diva? This woman make me bow down on her presence ❤
Are we getting Bo Burnham or not?
Why did Sean start to repeat the same thing like 2-3 times every episode now
She’s about to die Sean, and you’re still asking gotdamn questions.  😄
Where is the song outro!? AGAIN!? 🥺
wondering if Sean can get the Rock and Kevin Hart on hots ones at the same time. That would be an awesome episode
It’s a show with hot questions and even hotter guests.
Are there any plans to bring the hot ones chicken international? Canada would love this
Sean missed asking 3 questions (2,4,6) - though Gal did ask him questions.
Can you please make vegan frozen hot ones strips? Thanks! :)
Was Sean interviewing Gal or was Gal interviewing Sean?
Sean, bro, how did you remain so composed during this interview? She's a goddess. 😳🫡
CHICKEN STRIPS?!🏃🏽‍♀️
She on The Fast& the Furious?!?!  I gotta catch up on those.
EIGHT years and STILL some of the best journalistic questions Ive heard in ages; still a bit softball, but thats the point.
Can they remove the double tables? With Covid being pretty over it’s looking silly
Anyone know why they went from one table to 2 tables apart? I miss Sean’s chemistry with the guests when he’s close and personal with them while they’re dying from spice 😂
What happened here?
Idk if anyone has ever asked this question but, what happens if a guess is a vegan or vegetarian? Do they eat the different sauces on just celery sticks😂
Why do you always edit out talking about the last dab?? That is like a staple of your videos
Is Gal Gadot allowed to do one of these things during the SAG strike because she has technically never acted in anything?
I feel like there weren't many questions... is it just me? I know this is probably edited but, I felt like I heard less questions in this episode.
What is it about Israel that nurtures incredibly spirited women? 🪷
8:59 is that supposed to be Han?
She's one of the few that I'd ask to test a theory that french kissing helps reduce the heat from spicy wings and ask her to help test that theory.
Maybe have Chris as a guest?
Can we please get back to sitting across the table from one another and eating food like normal human beings again?
At first when I noticed that the questions stopped coming, I was thrown off, but I liked the way it evolved naturally from there.
How did Saun obtain the Lasso of truth?😂
How did Saun obtain the Lasso of Truth?😂
How did Saun obtain the Lasso of truth?😂
How did Saun obtain the Lasso of truth?😂
The best part of these interviews for me is when the guest asks Sean about things throws compliments about his work. Never gets old.
How did Saun obtain the Lasso of truth?😂
Sean used to ask the deep dive questions where the guests would be like HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?! Questions seem a lot more corporate now...
Isn’t this lady a Zionist?
Nobody going to mention that we've (or maybe just me?) been pronouncing her last name wrong? Thought that T was silent.
Wonder Woman dying  Sean: So is there an underrated Israeli snack that more Americans should know about?  😂😂😂
It's the Show with hot questions, and even hotter wings, and this time... the Hottest Woman on Earth ❤
i wonder how long they're going to keep up with the two table set up.
How is it after 21 seasons that the last dab still has TBA listed for the Scoville rating?
Where was the last dab?
The real question is who grab gal’s sweat napkin she threw out….😂
Just one question, was it harder than killing children for the IDF? Definitely looks like it
Did anyone notice Sean didn’t get 10 questions out like he usually does?
Anyone know how to spell that wafer snack she was talking about after DaBomb?
When is this show going to finally realize it’s 2023 and you can eat at the same table? 🍽️😂
Is she the first guest who wasn't offered the last dab tradition?
How does one focus with Gal Gadot in front of you?! Sean Evans is a true professional 👏 👌 🙌
You should have asked her, about the new Snow White release.
I hate when celebrities skip out on the bomb why go if ur gonna skip the big one.
Where does this land with the SAG strike?
Maybe don't invite guests that support apartheid?
Sean is not asking one question per wing?
whats up with the table distance? covid scaryness ?
Did she read the bottles from right to left? Makes sense.
Could we perhaps one day have a bonus episode where you interview Chris? :D
Gal immediately interrogating the financials/equity split of the show and having legal counsel on offer to Sean is the most Israeli thing imaginable.
I absolutely love Gal. However, has anyone ever seen Gal and Dua Lipa together at the same time???
"What?"
Did she cut her eyebrow between wings??
Can Yall get Keith Lee on the show?
Ask her why she supports Apartheid in her home country.
Why she dressed as a judge?
Gotta love how they still ask "Wait, why you shaking it?" And the classic what you have going on in your life? "What?" You know, maybe you have a big movie coming out or something. "Oh yeah."
Did they tape all these pre-strike?
can we bring her back every season?
I love gal gadot!! ❤ Can you invite Blake Lively next? 😅
Where are all my israelis? Btw the lyrics for the tongue twist are: Sara shara shir sameach shir sameach sara shara Have fun.
why gal gadot armpit is pretty than my face?
Tortit? Really??
I usually forget this is an interview, to me it's just two strangers getting to know each other over wings lol
I forgot I was watching a show about hot questions and even hotter wings
Ask her about Palestine. Much spicier topic.
Isnt she a zionist? Out of every celebrity to bring on you choose a zionist.....
Has Sean ever worn the same outfit???
My top favorite 3 parts about hot ones is of course sean evans question, music, clapping.
Why nobody saying anything about the spitting & drool 🤢
Ask about her support of apartheid!
Before I watch this... Did Sean ask her about the Imagine video? If not. I'll pass. Cop out from Sean.
Who is the woman in the middle at 9:00 ? I've seen the film but can't remember her or find her on the imdb cast list
What's the name of the music at the very beginning?)))
Who?
I’m glad that at least one guest finally asked Sean how they started it. I think she’s the only one. Also, great job for a finale.
His interviews have gotten much more soft ball with the questions. Not alot about her past or acting history or anything like that
Did she dab the last one ?
It's going to some random, but how in the world am I getting flustered every time she smiles or just does some little gesture
I dont understand y they don't start w the wings from the left to the right like reading a book or writing.. they need to switch it because the guests are gonna grab the wrong one
Does she have a spit bowl on her lap because it would be pretty gross if she spat it out in her dress lol.
so she isn't on strike?
Who in a man is as hot is gal gadot is hot as a woman ? Henry cavil ? She is a whole package beauty and talent.
The spitting!! Lol, wth?!!!
This woman always makes me wonder
Where can I buy da bomb?
Was hoping for some questions about Palestine.
Hot questions, hot wings and even hotter guests.
Isn't it frowned upon to promote movies during the Writer and Actor strike?
Did they address the MKBHD v Gal Gadot beef?
Who?
Isn't this scabbing? I thought actors couldn't promote work during the strike?
Who?
Day 777 of asking Sean Evans to invite Keanu Reeves on hot ones.
