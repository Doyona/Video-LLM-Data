Over a dice game right?
Sometimes you just have to look in the mirror and ask yourself what's going on.
I seriously don't understand why there aren't protests?
Wheres BLM on this??? Thought yal cared
Who?????
What’s the point of every news channel reporting the same shit like how do these new companies all exist I don’t get it
So was he purposely shot or just got hit
Supposed to be a private party??!! Sudden death seems to be an occupational hazard in the rap game.
What is wrong with the 🌎 where this becomes the norm????Prayers to that man's family R.I.P  🙏
Aren't all black people rappers!
Who's Takeoff?   Never heard of him.
What does BLM have to say about this ??
is he Tookoff now?
Do all the other rappers still pour their malt liquor out
who?
Who?
A rapper shot and killed?  Someone must have got disrespekted….
Sus where's the camera footage and the suspect
What kind of millionaire hangs around a dice game?
Shot in the head? That sounds like execution to me. No one saw the shooter ? Ummm this needs to be investigated further.
How dff do you make a joke and say fraction…… respectfully
Is this what defund the police looks like. RIP.
His real name is Kurishknect??? Wow that is a ancient name that means ," One that feeds off Vampires!"(Vampires killers). That's a cool name! 😎
can black people stop killing each other when will this stop ???????? where’s blm ??????
In Texas who would thought
Dice? Why? Smh
Why are these shootings still going on? RIP Kirshnik Ball (Takeoff)
Why do rappers have the corniest, lamest, weakest real names?
How can this bowling alley be the only place on planet earth that doesn't have a camera?
Who?
Another one bites the dust,  how come no one is calling it out, that most rappers are killed by other blacks
How much you wanna bet he was killed by another black man?
So Qua was there? He ran from bullets? You've got to be kidding me that that wack as posie a ss bi tch a ss mother ucker of an Uncle whos lived longer and currently breathing didn't do anything but run? I can die comfortably knowing my family is safe i guess not many real "G-Code" mfkres like me around anymore.. These kids nowadays is just a poor example of "Courage" formally known as heart aka balls aka umf aka cojones aka gull aka Male DNA
Idu y America allowed a guns in public, r they stupid or what?
When will these senseless crimes 🛑, this is so heartbreaking
so did they catch the shooter? or did they manage to TAKEOFF...........
Why do all of these rappers keep getting shot and killed ?, my prayers go to Takeoff’s family 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾.
Didn't his own crew shoot him by being reckless
wtf ?! u mean u cannot reach out ya hand n speak to a rich rapper that is in your presence? if i’m playing dice around rich niggas that means they comfy around u ain’t nothing i can’t speak about smh i’m not going around ppl i don’t know when i make money
Probably fake or not either way some kinda sacrifice 😅 I don’t trust shit I don’t see unless im there myself .
Why even put yourself in that situation
WTF is going on in Houston??!!! Didn’t King Von get killed in Houston as well??!!  I live in Dallas but stayed in Houston for a year and it was cool!!!
You have made it. Why indulge in the same negative behavior? Leave the bullshit behind
Take off with a sacrifice and you wonder why offset left the group something got to do with quality control
Fuck was quavo doin, runnin?
Wonder if that snake Benjamin crump will make a press conference?
isnt he the one that sould his sould or whatever and the migos stopped messing with him or whatvr?
This is all speculation but here’s my thoughts on what happened, guy that’s standing behind takeoff starts shooting, probably a switch idk I’ve never pulled the trigger on a gun , takeoff jumps up fast clearly shook , and as he stands up he’s now directly in the line of fire and takes a bullet to the head. ( I always wondered why the say get down if someone is shooting, now ik y , someone could be shooting over u ) RIP takeoff a tragedy for sure but could’ve been prevented if a) the guy didn’t shoot from behind Takeoff and B) Takeoff had ducked down instead of jumping up
Rest In Peace Takeoff this is so random. Can people just get along and stop killing each other please? This is exhausting at this point hearing about all these rappers dying.
It's unfortunate that he died but...who is this? I've never heard of this person.
Did the shooters get captured or did they takeoff?
Why do we never hear about this with Met stars? 🤔
What is wrong with black Americans ??? Are we also going to blame white people??? Honestly white life matters
What label? Because these labels are looking suspicious while they benefit from their client’s deaths.
Offset Wassup Bro ? 😂
This just seems so suspect
Another rapper sacrificed someone is about to come up that knows him Offsets album Dropping Soon coincidence?
Rich as fucc yet still rolling dice outside a bar at 2 am?
What happened to a fist fight damn
did nobody really see the shooter?
Who kill him? A white guy?
wait nobody saw him get shot or who did it but they know that he was playing dice when it happened how do they know he was playing dice if they don't know who it was with
Another 1 bites the dust  Whos next? Stay tuned.
Who?
Who?
Takeoff? Tf kind name is that?
Rapper shot? That doesn't make sense
And how many folks will cooperate with the police to get justice? That's the saddest part.
It’s crazy because he was the best Mogo 🤔 you gotta ask yourself who benefits
Did he live a life to please Jesus? Where did his soul go?
Oh snap he really died? Sheesh i thought  it was a prank cause I been seeing all kinda celebrities die the past week that certainly weren't dead
Why was there guns at a private party? You know who you invited
MY QUESTION IS WHO TF SHOT HIM?
Why are people so heartless coz we are losing so many great legends🤧.RIPTAKEOFF❤️
Why is it that I never hear about these “rappers” until after they are shot and killed ✊🏿🤡?

Oh No! Who?

Just aweful... another young man gone for what????🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
HEY!?!?!?............That would make for a great lyric! "Was shot in the head and later pronounced dead"!  Thank You.......Thank You!.........I'll be here all weak.

They should question his boyfriend…maybe he knows sonething?

Huh is this real?

So umm  where’s blm? Crickets huh? No protest? No rioting?
Why didnt he just take off?
I wonder if it was a white person who shot him? 🤷‍♂️
Why are you playing dice?
Where's blm?
So what's the bad news??????
Guess he didn't take off.. too soon?
Sacrificial lamb how could the brothers do this the best rapper in the group
Does anyone know the location of the BLM protests for this?
playing dice at a bowling alley at 2 a.m with quavo? why though??  rip brother
What the fk going on
Who?
Who?
Why aren't county artists being shot monthly?  What are they doing that the hip hop community isn't?
When are people going to learn that shooting dice has hardly ever ended peacefully???
WTF is this real 😡😡
Who?
Wtf???
Was it the white supremacists Biden warned us about? Far right extremists?
This deadass real?
Bro this is crazy. All over a game of dice?
Wtf is takeoff lmfao
Who?
First off, why were people in there with guns??? If i'm famous the only people around me that can have guns are my security. These Black men are dying left and right,sad.
Playing dice though? I’m confused…… why are you illegally gambling at that wealth level.  That’s sad. Dangerous world now and days.
Tampon wrapper or candy wrapper ?
Was it a white cop?
How are you takeoff and playing dice ? Lmfao
Gee whiz!!  A rapper shot to death in Houston!! I wonder if anyone is surprised by that??     BTW the were shooting dice on a public sidewalk after midnight. Nothing sketchy there, right?
Most rappers are dying by gun violence, when is that going to stop?
Why so many dead rappers. ?  We don't get this murder rate in an other genre of popular music.   Oh wait a minute !
Omg why does this happen
BLM, where the outrage for black on black crime?
Isn't that next to the house of blues????
Doesn't even make sense because did he have any real beef was he in a gang I guess not these rappers get in trouble one way or another and their own people kill them too
Were there ultra MAGA dudes??? Or, Savages?   You know.
Is anyone seriously surprised 😮
Wonder if migos would fly to Houston and roll for him? R.I.P.
Out of the three Migos who has the most to gain with one member being absent???
Where’s BLM now? Quiet when its black on black crime?
How is this news
When will this sh*t end!!!!
This is a big world so why when people have an argument they just can’t get in their cars and go? Learn to walk away?
Quality Control Music=111 and he's dead November 1 also written 1/11 or 11/1?🤷🏾‍♂️🍻🍺
How much hatred can there be in someone to kill just for killing? 🙏
Why are people shocked? The individual may be quiet and humble but the circumstances he put himself in and the system and culture of violence that he moved in doesn’t always distinguish between the docile and the belligerent. As a man, you safeguard yourself and your family by not placing around or by removing yourself from those who are prone to violence. He grew up in the hood. He knows when there are potentially violent dudes around. It’s sad, but it’s not really shocking given the propensity for violence among black men. We do it to ourselves all the time.
Who???
broooo what  😥
What you mean I was left off bad and boujee?, I wasn't left off bad and boujee. Gone to soon.
What???
Who?
What could go wrong during dice game lol
I feel so bad for black people. Like are u fucking kiding me ? What do they have to go out in bullet proof clothes head to toe? FFS let them live and be in PEACE
Who?
Is that a STRIKE?
Who’s next?
Where is BLM now??
Who?
Why was he shot?
Another one? Not a good time to be a rapper I guess
Bro why you even playing dice
Where was the good guy with the gun?
Kings killing each other like dogs in the street wat are we doing
Who?
Omg what?? 😭
Set-up, who, what when... Freaken sad 😢
Is rapper considered the most dangerous profession?
This all seems sketchy that no one saw
Doesn't every bowler make sure they also pack a gun before they leave the house to go bowling??? The absolute "bizarreness" of that world of hip hop
Why do these "rappers" have such lame ass names? Another senseless murder....
I wonder if 4 law enforcement agencies showed up like they did for Pelosi's husband who was not killed 🤔🤔.??? RIP young man. 💔
Takeoff??? Who tf is that……oh well
I thought it was white ppl killing blks? lol
What are you going to say to Saint Peter???
No bodyguards where were they
Does anyone know Takeoff's pronouns? Need to know for the sympathy card.  Rest in peace
Wow wtf???
No cctv footage ???
Who??????
Oh know I hope this a lie
Who?
I find it odd another rapper is "randomly" shot. No such thing as a coincidence.
Where was dudes security man
Shit rapping ain't easy, why is it that everything that colored people are associated with their is violent, shooting, killing. And mayhem, and they are always looking for justice.
Please tell me this is a prank… 😢🤦🏾‍♂️👎🏿
Bro what the fuck 😡
Why is anyone surprised?
What led up to the shooting? Maybe being at a bowling alley at 2:30 in the morning playing dice 🤔
How safe is American cities ?
Whos3 body double was that? Report to your prayers so the aliens can continue their investigation on who needs to die  Ps they already know who needs to and who they’re going to kill
How does no one saw the shooter
Can you say sacrifice
