Is there anything here in NYK vs IND (IND Leads 1-0) that the NYK will win in 5 or 6?
I cannot remember which game was, but there were these 5 mins where I saw Atlanta playing this flawless out of space game. Did anybody notice/saw it? Speaking from Raps fan.
Not trying to hate on the Hawks but is it me but it seems they only have one offensive set "high pick and roll" but for some reason no one tries to defend against it other than have the center show which creates an easy floater (it's like a layup for a skilled player like Trae) even worst a smaller defender who's a step behind has to try to get back an stop a big man lob...Great offensive scheme designed by Nate McMillan, horrible defensive adjustment by Doc Rivers and Tom Thibodeau.
@8:40 in the video, didn't Milwaukee need a THREE POINTER to TIE the game? Then WHY did they go for the two pointer? Just curious. I'm getting the impression Milwaukee is trying to blow this game because of sports betting or the PTB wanted them to lose.
It it just me or is giannis majority of the time he score 34
Who are the two guys with Galanari at 8:27
is lou williams not like how he used to be?
Am I the only one that watched this more than once?? 🔥🔥🔥 Trae put on a show 👀👀
Who else is watching highlights even tho they saw the game 😂😂
Hawks?? Really?
TUCKER AND CAPELLA IN ECF 👏👏👏 HARDEN??? 🙅🤷🤦
Where was antepkupo & the crossed eyed demon..niggaz didn't show up for work🙄
How did the commentator think that was a 3 from Gallinari lmao
Does anyone really consider a Hawks win an upset anymore?  What an exciting, young team they have in the ATL.
What kind of camera was that in the end
How many crossovers did ATL get on the bucks my goodness
Ice Trae is the new #Shimmy 👑  Sup Milwaukee? 😂🤣😭 #SWISH
And people be doubting the Hawks don’t forget we got Trae
Anyone else remember Trae Young in college
6:59 tf?
Young Vs Booker in the Finals. Who u got?
Why Chris Middletown didn't lay that shit up they were only down 1...
I can believe NBA channel needs a lot of ads for this video.. are they poor now???
Can the Hawks finally get anyyyyyy respect from the national media ?
Mike budenholzers game plan is going under the screen and drop coverage against trae? Fire this man
So when are ppl gonna start realizing trae young is better than luka
Milwaukee played like it was a scrimmage and still could have won
Imagine that this year's NBA final is the Phoenix Suns vs the Atlantic Hawks?  Team that haven't make the playoffs in so long and they both made in the the NBA Finals???
Is Trae Young the closest thing to Iverson we've seen since his time?
Middleton could’ve worked a little more for a better look at that last shot. Or give it to jrue as this was probably the best game he’ll have in the whole playoffs.
Can u imagine the NBA nightmare matchup in the finals if Suns vs Hawks😂
You would think in an Eastern Conference game one they would play some defense.   Both teams are treating it like an all star game.  Bucks allow Young to score 48 on wide open shots
Bucks just beat a superteam and now they lose to the Hawks? Lol
Is Brook Lopez injured….he killed us on the glass when they played the heat…..why was he not out there…..that Capella offensive rebound won them the game.
how they just gonna give him a free 3 points, that bump wasn’t a foul nor was it a shooting foul/continuation? that shit was absurd 7:20
lmaoo what is the defense by bucks
What on Earth is Brook Lopez doing? Why are all the bigs sagging 15 feet off their man, poor guy defending Trae Young has to fight through the screens all alone, of course Trae is going to get wide open looks playing 2 vs 1.  0:14 Trae could've pulled up with all kinds of space here. 1:39 look where Lopez is standing. Of course Young pulls up with the Bucks players pretty much observing social distancing. 1:50 Lopez chilling under the basket  And there was a LOT more of this. Jeez, Bucks completely let Trae Young get hot, they could have won this game easy.
how you gonna let a team like the hawks beat you They got akompotentopo he like 13'8
Did Giannis choke this game ? Sorry I was at work and I didn’t see the full game
Um...when you skip ahead 5-7 points between plays, that's not a "full" game highlight.
alley oop using the backboard in a play off game? who else can do that aside from trae?
Jrue holiday and brook Lopez wtf was that on those pick and rolls,Lopez u gone sit yo dumb ass in the paint and just watch him shoot
Trae is very good but i wanna see Jrue's adjustments on defense. Plus why the fuck is Giannis often on the perimeter? I can't think of anyone who can guard him inside smh
Why the hell giannis didnt miss that freethrow and follow it up with a dunk or put back layup is beyond me
So how many all stars vs how many all stars?
4:51.. First team all defense!?
Curry who?
Should we bring out the brooms???
Is this trae vs mil highlights?
maybe giannis should switch his jersey number to 45 because he's been shooting 34 points every game
2 free throws to ice the game where have I seen this before 🤔
why is everyone calling the ws of atl an upset? they be doing this the whole szn. put some respect smh
What if the Mavs didn't trade Trae Young to the Hawks for Luka... someone's scratching their head right now
Is brook lopez hurt? Didn't see any highlights...
Is Atlanta going to win this series I'm confused ???
When was the last time a five seed made the NBA finals?
Does NBA take a new ball in every match ??
wtf, giannis is more clutched in free-throw than pg? lol
how can gallinari lose tucker like that?
WTF is they doing with 27.3 seconds left and 21 seconds on the clock. Run the clock down and get the ball to Giannis or Khris. This dummy takes a 3 point shot which cost us the game.
Anyone else wonder why Giannis didn't miss the second free throw on purpose to just race and grab the rebound?  I mean would that have worked?  😝
Why does tway do what Steph does everytime he makes a shot? 😑
What the hell is Reggie Miller talking about, how is Trae Young a super star? The media and retired NBA players are so quick to call these guys super stars, and they haven't won shit yet! They was calling Ben Simmons a super star not to long ago also. 👀😑
Suns vs Hawks finals???
Should the Mavericks be salty if trae wins a ring this year?
Did this man trae shimmy in the middle of a conference finals game😨
Im not rooting for either team but if the bucks wanna win, post up on Trae and tire him out , the only way any team will slow him down...is that so hard? Both Milwaukee guards are bigger than him, why not?
So now im so curious who really won the lottery pick between LUKA & TRAE??  Help me with this im confused🙁🧐
young, curry 2.0?
Is it an upset if everyone #Believe$???
Do the Bucks break their team up if they lose this series?Let's debate and also Middleton mad inconsistent
Where is Lopez? WTF Bucks lol.
6:49 lol Trae could you maybe play some defense after missing that shot? instead of walking backwards with your hands down while your man throws an uncontested full court pass to giannis for an and 1?
Jrue dropped 30 and the Bucks still lost???   Series over. 🥴
No effing way? Pls for humanity's sake..i hope the bucks don't choke this series..may Zeus help Giannis win the series.💪
Does anyone know the song from 5:18?
WHO SHOT THE THREE?  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Which highlight do you like?
Lil 6'1 prepubescent Trae Young dropping 50 pieces in the playoffs and people question whether MJ would dominate this era 😆
Dissapointed in giannis idk if he got tht IT factor to go alongside his skill and athleticism , he needs to be more dominant and attack the rim and be creative with his slashing
Wth connaughton doing in that crucial moment
Bucks in 4. Who? 🤣
HIM TRYING TO STAY IN FRONT OF WHOM AGAIN?
What’s with trae young’s hair..it looks like pubic hair 🤣
How do the hawks keep doing this  Is everyone doubting them? Cuz I have
Kevin who? Trae young!!!
Hawks have scratched the Bucks, but can they keep up the momentum for them to slay the bigger foe?
where are the bucks in 4 at?
I’m at work, did Trae have more points than ads in this video?
I wonder how next playoffs will be with everybody being healthy and new teams arising. Like suns Hawks and Jazz
So is Trae better than Luka now?
Lopez what is your doing?
why would the bucks not shoot a three when there was 17 seconds left that was a way to lose the game
Nobody gonna talk about Bobby Portis trying to injure Trae Young? Fell full weight on him for no reason. Dirty play.
The question now is will the Hawks sweep the Bucks not the Bucks sweeping the Hawks 😅
Why are they called apartments if they are together
Who the goat ?
Too early to say but a Finals between youngbloodz and vets would be awesome: Booker/CP3 vs Trae/Lou Will
Why do teams take a 3 when u only down 1 with like 25 secs left in the game 🤦
I wonder what people think about the Trae Young Luka Doncic trade now.. Lol and yes I live in Atlanta
does anyone else feel like this game was 30 minutes long?
literally a minute how tf are y'all here. did u watch the game and went straight to youtube?!
Bucks vs Hawks in the Eastern Conference Finals? I mean, am I seeing it right? lmfao xD
