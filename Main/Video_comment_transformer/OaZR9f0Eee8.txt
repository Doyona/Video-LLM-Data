13:23 okay well what if he was playing a role the whole time (country look) and only then showed his true self (rock and roll look)
Never heard the name Garth? For me at least,  Garth from Wayne's world with Wayne and Garth is the first Garth I think of when someone says the name Garth.
Is he cosplaying as Chris angel?
danny... have you never seen wayne's world?!!
Wait I know that Chris gains song lol
I know music is subjective but HOW is this guy one of the highest selling muscians?!?! its like really bad
I don't know if I'd say Garth Brooks with every one of the biggest musicians in the world. Play the biggest musician in The honky tonk bars.
7:46 cloyster? The Pokémon? /j
did he just want to be trent reznor for a while 😭
never heard the name garth before? have you never seen waynes world?
why does chris gaines kind of look like a poorly drawn trent reznor
I was just uh. Wondering how these disguises didn't work. Like. Those are two completely different people. Then I remembered I am face blind ✌️😭
That was supposed to be rock 'n' roll? None of the songs in this video sounded like it.
am i crazy or does the beginning of the song at 5:53 sound like billie bossa nova by billie eilish
Does anyone know the name of the song that plays at 3:17 ?? Please help.
What about earl dibbles jr ??
Is that piano in the background of 3:55 dance with the devil by immortal technique 😭
Why was this thumbnail necessary.
Didn't Charlie do a video on him being an Internet suspected serial kills?? Friends in low places😂😂
Why is no one talking about how Chris looks just onision??? A real jumpscare
Why does it feel like he has a southern accent here I'm losing my mind
Wheres the bodies G? 😂
Why is it weird that they got married after writing music together?  Do you also think it would be odd if two people painted a chapel together and fell in love. If not, where is it OK for two people to meet and later allowed to get married?
Is this what inspired Joaquin Phoenix and the whole ‘I’m still here’ rapper thing?
I clicked cause it recommended me this vid and I thought “why is this guy calling Onision a musician.”
fox_szn? isnt that guys some kinda....nepo baby?
Can you imagine the polygamy lawsuits if Drake married his ghost writers
hey, isn't this guy from that one vine?
wait fox szn is danny? why am i js learning this
We still don't know where Garth put the bodies.
Why is Danny pretending to be fox szn?
How much do you and Kurtis Konner hang out lol I catch some of his inflections in your voice 😂
Why is the second channel the main channel
Tell us where the bodies are, Garth!!!
I’m old enough to remember when that happened and thinking WTF?!
What y’all know about Chris Gaines?!! Lol😂
Is Danny coming back as FoxSzn to collab with Chris Gaines?
Chris Gaines? More like Garth Reznor.
How have I never heard of this man, nor heard any of his top songs
Am i the only person who hasnt heard about this, 😂 i really must have led a sheltered life.
Where are the bodies Garth?
Ok I usually don't write comments, but  PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT IS THE PIECE PLAYED AT 00:29 CALLED???  I have heard it many times before, but I never bothered to check, nor ask. Deeply regretting my decisions.
That’s not Onision??
Danny, how are you older than me and looking that good?
You’ve never watched Wayne’s World?! Wayne and Garth? Sir, you need to brush up on your movies. 😂😂
4:55 ain’t this just the plot of Austin and Ally
2:33 bro has no one noticed Danny’s hickey????? On the right side of his neck it’s big too😭💀😅
Have you never seen Wayne's World?
Didn't Lady Gaga also do this as Jo Calderone? Her male alter ego. I remember this back in 2010. I don't recall if she made music as Jo Calderone but she did pose as him.
they call me nepo baby? im not a baby, i am 45😋
my mother is a huge Garth Brooks fan, i texted her asking if she knew who Chris Gaines was and she responds with a picture of a CHRIS GAINES CD
Who did it better garth or miley?
Why did Dave filoni try to become onision?
Youve never heard of Wayne and Garth from Wayne's World?
Where are the bodies Garth?
Didnt he just pass away?
the the fuck is danny older than Jschlatt!!?!!??!
Where’s the bodies Garth??
Never heard the name garth?  😑  ... go watch Wayne's World, life noob
Is he not the male version of Hannah Montana or am I trippin
2:31 is it just me or does he look like the guy from Zoolander??
Garth, the families want answers.
Mom can we have kurt cobain?  Honey we have kurt cobain at home Kurt cobain at home:
I wonder if Chris Gaines knows where the bodies are
"was this as his career faded into irrelevance?" garth brooks has never faded into irrelevance lol last year he played a concert to over 100,000 people
3:17 anyone know the name of the music used in the background..?
Is that Robert orrrrrr…..Dave Franco that’s the real question
damn what is it with me and guys around my older brothers age?? i get along w them well,  i end up watching them on yt, we werent even close and yet here i am hearing u say u were about my brothers age when i was born
guys please what song is in the background of 3:18... please don't tell me its just royalty free rock music i need an actual song
Where are the bodies?
Yikes,  like the awesome 90s pencils?
where are tbe bodies g
cant he just do a persona
Where are the bodies Garth? #YMH
Why is Robert kinda......😍
I cannot for the LIFE of me figure out what the thumping that starts at 10:00 is. Was he like??? Kicking the wall???
Where are the bodies Garth? Where are they!
Where are the bodies Garth?
Where are the bodies Garth?!
Chris Angel made music? I never knew
Where are the bodies Garth? The families need closure.
I remember when that came out. Werent we supposed to know it was him though? Sort of like when Beyoncé did that alter ego Sasha Fierce album
13:21 I mean which names sounds more real… Chris Gaines or Garth Brooks
What if Garth Brooks’ alter ego was Darth Brooks
Why Chris Gaines look like Light Yagami
WHY DOES CHRIS LOOK LIKE ONISION??? HOW DID GARTH BROOKS SEE INTO THE FUTURE LIKE THAT-
Danny is turning 30?!????????
How did no one notice that weirdest was spelt wrong 😭
Where are the bodies Garth?!
Ooh idk about the Austin Butler becoming Elvis thing, wonder if that would be an entertaining video
Why is Garth Brooks cosplaying Onision
I don't understand how this is a 'rock star'? His music sounds like enya or maybe a pop artist. He looks a little like Hinder or Green Day but music is just him signing with very soft guitar and drums.
Did you KNOW?  Uh Yeah  I knew  everyone at the time knew.  Hell he didn't hide it cause he knew we were going to laugh even harder at Garth if he tried to hide it.  Trouble is he didn't know just how hard we would laugh without him hiding it.
Have you not seen any of Tom Seguras very in-depth Garth Brooks  coverage?
This video is 17:38 long, I'm like hey what's up hello
i can’t help but wonder something super irrelevant. say someone who was not previously famous came out with an alter ego and the public only knew them as such. would that character be considered “fictional” like chris gaines would or would it be considered just another celebrity
No one mentions Chris Gaines is 100 lbs skinnier than Brooks? 😂
I wonder if Tom Segura knows about this.
So they just ask every GB fan hey was you confused and they were like yah wasnt you.
From what I hear, a lot of women have gone Missing right about the time Garth Brooks decides to come around and play a show in their town. Coincidence?   Or is he a murderer?  🤔
Where are the bodies garth?
Garth who?
Why does this kid have 2.1 million subscribers
Neck hickey?
Is it just me or does he look JUST like the lead singer of the RHCP from the 90s. i havent seen a picture of him in a while but thats like the vivid memory i have for whatever reason lol
Where are the bodies Garth?
Is Robert that comedian guy I keep seeing on you tube shorts or am I crazy 💀
How have I never noticed how pretty Danny’s eyes are? They look like the turquoise water in the Caribbean. (I’m faded rn and I spent the whole video trying to determine if they were edited or not)
14:28 a plane crash? was that gonna be in the movie? 😭
12:28 wait isn’t Chris Gaines supposed to be a Rock star? 😅
Wasn't this the plot to a Disney show didn't Disney invite this 😂
I still need to know wtf they did for the snl transition...
Maybe Chris Gaines was The Unknown
But.. he didn’t try to change his identity..? Everyone knew who he was, it’s just a pen name
I confused dude with James blunt. So James blunt is real?
Where are the bodies Garth?
Never heard the name Garth?   Is Wayne's World a joke to you?
No love for Ned Flames?
Michael Jackson?
Was he experiencing psychosis or some shit 😭
Where are the bodies Chris Gaines?
Where are the bodies Garth?
Can u tell me who this Robert guy is ? I can't find his youtube channel or anything ☹️☹️
Where are the body’s Garth?? The families NEED closure!!
Why does he look like Onision though....?
Why does the new him look like onision lol
Why’d I think the picture of his alter ego was accidentally Onision? 💀😂😂😂😂
Does Danny know about Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus
What do you mean fails? I remember this being a big deal lol.
Danny, respectfully,  wtf happened to your neck? Were you attacked by animal or something?
Is that a THREAT Mr Brookes???
Wait stop… my mom had a Chris Gaines CD. You tellin me that was just Garth Brooks??? How did I not know this lmao …Ok you can continue now
12:10 why is the backstory part unintentionally hilarious??
So, was Garth brooks trying to make a biopic about a fictional rock star that he was attempting to convince the world was a real person? And whatever the original vision for it was got kind of discarded based on public reception? But that ended up being fine because it was genuinely just an excuse to cosplay as his OC?
7:50 what the hell is a coloister I think I slipped into an alternate reality
Is Chris Gaines not just Keith Urban? 😂
where are the bodies garth??
Why do I feel like every big artist is the number one artist in one demographic or another
what is a cloister 😭😭
Hey guys. Are we making fun of the hickey or what?
Has Danny heard of Spinal Tap? 😂
How do we know Robert isn’t secretly Danny.
Am i having a stroke? I swear Danny did this video like 2 years ago?? Is this a reupload?
... how do i know who chris graines is just by the name and look alone but NOT the man behind him..?
Is no one gonna talk about the video being 17:38 minutes long 😫 IM LIKE HEY WASSUP HELLO
lol why did I think that was onision?
Has anyone considered the unreleased movie might have been a comedy? Chris Gain's life is so outrageously tragic. It's like someone is taking the piss of the tortured artist trope
Has anyone ever seen Chris Gaines and Onision in the same room together? 🤔
I'm like hey what's up hello
Isn't that actually exactly what Taylor Swift is doing? She just calls it "eras" 🤨
Where are the bodies G?
Tell me more about Robert
wild that i scrolled for several minutes on a video about garth brooks and didnt see a single comment about the bodies? those families deserve closure
when you mentioned "was this as his career was starting to fade into irrelevance or is this at the height of his fame?" I laughed a little. just for background, he never really faded into irrelevance. he's STILL wildly successful. He regularly sells out stadiums and still makes new music. Friends in Low Places is in the top 5 on several country music charts, and is even #1 on a few.
Why does the picture of him in the thumbnail look just like onision bro I’m screaming
if sacha baron cohen was just borat i might not question it
Why have you called Drew “Robert”?
Where's the bodies Garth?
i have never heard of Brooks. how????
Anybody else think Chris Gaines looks like Onision a little bit
Where's the bodies Garth?
What did he hope to Gaine from this?
Where are the bodies Garth? The families need closure.
Where are the bodies Chris
How could YOU not have heard of Garth Brooks?!?!?
plot twist he wasn't writing a movie, he was trying to convince broadway that he could play Jekyll & Hyde instead of David Hasselhoff
why does he keep on metioning his editor robert ? in every video
why do i feel like robert isnt real
Are you sure this isn't just Garth Brook's D&D character? The tragic backstory is certainly there.
Is Chris Gaines literally a Nashville plotline?
HELP why does his alter ego look like Onision with a soul patch😭
Danny what have you done?? Now i have been listening to Chris Gaines all day !!!!!
Can your hickey on your neck get any bigger?!?!
Isn't this just one big One Piece reference
Still tryna figure out where the bodies are 🤷
Isn’t this basically the same thing as Beyoncé / Sasha Fierse?
Maybe consider installing an ad blocker, less to blur out and a cleaner screen
Where's the bodies, G??
Am I trippin or did Danny’s voice get deeper since he had his baby
Why is your hair turning gray?
Is this a reupload or am I having major deja vu?
gregs, is it just me or am I lowkey getting suspicious of Robert (danny's team of content curators), idk danny shouting him out so often makes him sus. feels like danny's up to no good...
I always wondered about this because I was young when this happened and didn’t fully grasp the concept. Then saw the VH1 episode as a kid and thought Chris Gaines was actually a real person that just favored Garth Brooks 😂 Thanks for doing the research and letting us know!
Isn’t this what Ethel Cain is doing? Love her
Where are the bodies G?
Where are the bodies Garth?
Why did I assume the sleeping with the manager plot would be with a man and not a woman?
‏‪14:23‬‏ so is that one of the friends.. in low places?
I just want to know why he went "this is meant to be rock so I'll let someone else write it for me" and then got other country artists to write it.
How do we know this wasn't just you again 🤨
Fox Szn and Chris Gaines collab when?😭🛐💀
You don't do your own research?
why does "chris gaines" look like onision 😢😢
is Garth short for Garfield?
Danny didn’t know of any Garth’s? Someone make him read Garth Nix’s books (THEYRE AMAZING)
Why does it look like Garth Brooks took the entire 'Chris Gaines' look directly from Chris Angel?
Didn’t Beyoncé have a thing with Sasha Fierce or something? I don’t know all the details so I wonder how similar/different it is
when is the robert reveal that picture looks like its from 2008
where are the bodies garth?
So you pay a guy to come up with a curate a video then just wing it in one take? I'm not watching that crap. Tell your content curator to become a content creator.
where are the bodies garth?
This is kind of random, but apparently one of my family members dated Garth brooks
14:10 okay wait hold on. Didn't that car crash thing happen to Mark Hamill?? I get that this event is probably a common thing to happen to people but I can't help but imagine he just took what happened to him and used it for his own alter ago
More importantly… where are the bodies Garth?
You didn’t know this? Danny lives under a rock lol he knows about Chip Gaines but not this…Danny really just watches HGTV all day
Why are these articles written like a middle school book report though
Why is your thumbnail always a pic of yourself in what looks like landscape mode 😂 always stretched out lookin like a thumbnail from 2015
Um...Garth from Wayne's World??
Where are the bodies Garth?! 💀🦴
why is no one mentioning the fact that the alter ego is australian???
Hahah I wonder if this is the blue print Donald Glover/Childish Gambino followed
I wonder if they ever collab 😂 took me out.
is robert real……….?
Where are the bodies Garth?! The families need closure 👖
are you hitting your microphone or something. what is that fucking vine boom noise.
Im sorry but why did i keep thinking he looked like adam from three days grace lol😅
Anyone else suspicious of Robert
What happened in 1999? Is this a reverse: 1999 reference??
Wait, his house was burned down by arsonists? I thought gardeners were the ones out there burning buildings down.
The single was released before the album? That’s kind of how most singles work…
Why did he turn himself into Chris McLean from Total Drama Island?
I genuinely cannot tell if your Miley Cyrus joke is just self aware or if you actually didn't know there is an Hannah Montana Album called Meet Miley Cyrus
Is it weird that I’ve never heard of Garth Brookes?
where are the bodies, Garth? the families need closure
why does chris gaines look like a early 2000s pete wentz mixed with criss angel lol
danny is this you trying to throw us off are you chris gaines
Is this where the creators of Hannah Montana got their idea from?! That's plagiarism!
ur disguise looks IDENTICAL to my old gym teacher . what the fuck
Did anyone else think that pic was onision?😭
13:40 why would he make himself such a dark backround??? 😭
Wait a minute, didn't Drew Gooden do this like 4 years ago?
Where are the bodies Garth?
woah, is this an update on Paul Zimmer
"What was this movie? Just a series of bad things happening to this guy?" It was the late 90s, that was basically the vibe.
So you’re telling me that’s NOT onision????
What if Danny is garth brooks?
Why does he look like Onision tho
Where's the bodies Garth?
Has he ever HEARD a rock song?
Where are the bodies Garth?
is robert real?
So is the next video gonna be about the life and times of Dewey Cox?
Where did he leave the bodies though?
6:05 why does he look like Edna from the Incredibles
danny is a year older than me? shit i thought you were younger. youll look great at 65 danny
So when you're doing it, it's fun. When someone else is doing it, it's cringe?  Plus what's the deal with guy falling in love with his writer / co-worker? Life happens. Thought you'd be more respectful -,-
Why does that guy look like Onision when he’s emo that’s scary if you don’t know who he is bloody hell don’t google him
WHO THE FUCK IS ROBERT
1:00 reverse 1999 reference?
But how many bodies does he have in his basement?
Slow day on the internet you have to dive back in history?
I wonder if sometimes successful people do stuff like that to try and prove to themselves that their success is a product of their talent and hard work, not luck. I'm sure talent and work are part of it, but knowing the right people and being in the right place at the right moment makes a big difference. Rowling did something like this too, writing under a pseudonym, even though she would've sold more under her own name.
was Garth okay when he thought of that backstory though??? 💀
Did anyone else see the thumbnail and think it was Onision? 😂
Didn't Beyonce do that too, Sasha Fierce or some such?
My mom loved garth. He even started playing professional baseball at one point 😂  Identity crisis much?
didn't this same kind of thing happen a few years ago with paul zimmer?
But googling wasn't a thing in the 90's?
Why does he look like a Onision, as Chris? 😂
Why does Chris Gaines look like Onision if he could act sane long enough for a close up
this is so random but all right i guess
this dude also built houses with Jimmy Carter idk if he's real
Are we sure Chris Gaines wasn’t just five year old Danny
Where are the bodies, Garth? The families need closure.
Who is Robert?!? TELL USS DANNY!! Why does he mention him so often? I’m scared! We’re onto you Danny. You can’t fool Greg.
Wait!... Does Chris Gaines know where the bodies are then?? Where are the bodies Chris?
ok first of all, can somebody tell me who's robert? *wooow*
Is that Drake?
can’t girls just wanna have fun? can’t girls just create an alter ego with an extensive, tragic backstory backed up by fake friends and coworkers and release emo country music just for the heck of it? 🙄
anyone else think that robert looks like a franco brother??
I could have sworn the alter ego was Onision…. Why does he look like ONION ?!
So… were u not the fortnight guy who sang at the streamer awards??
I'm sorry but is Robert just an edited picture of Drew?? 😭
Where are the bodies Garth?
When are you just going to give up and give both of your channels to Robert?
I've never heard of Garth Brooks. I'm 30, am I too old, or too young? Or too European? HELP!
Why does Garth Brooks kind of look like Tom Segura though
Was it Garth Brooks or Chris Angel, pretty sure that joke went round in the 90s, magic tricks for everyone
why is robert just dave franco
You're telling me that is not Movie Star Actor Benjamin Stiller?
Wait why was there no greg.
Are we sure this guy wasn't Danny in disguise?
Who else is here watching and is so old you actually saw "Chris Gaines" go on Saturday Night Live?! 😂
Garth, where are the bodies?
whys this on the 2nd channel
how have i never heard of this singer...
Why does no one ever talk about the fact that Keith Urban IS Chris Gaines
thanks danny i have always wondered what that quadrangle was called this will help me going forward
Where are the bodies garth? the families just want closure
Who is Robert? What's his lore?
Is it only me who thinks the name Garth makes it sounds like he is some kind of Sith country singer?
Do you think this is what inspired Hannah Montana??
What if Danny did the opposite and got a person to pretend to be him, whilst Danny and he Denys being connected to him
My birth date is when Chris Gaines came out, am I Chris Gaines 😮
Where are the bodies Garth?
Why does Chris Gaines look like From Yesterday era Jared Letto?
Wasn’t this like 15 years ago?
Why does Garth Blaines look like onision?
Is he trying to make us believe that Robert is a real person so he can use “Robert” to go undercover 👀
Where are the bodies G?
Why does the thumbnail and music video make him look like onision
I saw the thumbnail and thought "is that onision?? 💀💀💀💀" very pleased to find it was in fact, not
WHERE ARE THE BODIES, G?!? Now Danny needs to look up the conspiracy theory on Garth Brooks.
Where are the bodies G?
6:06 why are his toes out
I'm a little worried at how consistently Danny is putting out videos now... you can be honest did Laura leave you
How did you not know the name Garth? Have you not seen Wayne's World?
What we really want to know is where he hid the bodies
Where are the bodies G?
Where the bodies at g?
All I can think about is the How I Met Your Mother episode about Robin Sparkles turning into Robin Daggers, and now I wonder if that was based on this situation.
why does the chris gains music kinda go hard
Or maybe Danny was Garth all along…😊
I think Donny Osmond tried that as well? Off to search the internet, but I swear I remember him trying something like that.
What about the people that have gone missing at his ranch or whatever? Was that Chris too? Lol.
Is that onision?
wait you are born in 1994? you look like you were born 2005 .. wow we do all of the people born in the 199_ look like this 😂
danny: wait so was this a bit? did the other albums exist or didn't they? why's he got so much backstory if this wasn't an attempted identity change me, nodding instantly: oh it was like the plots of the ology books
Guys… what is robbert is DANNY⁉️
Is this Danny Gonzalez??? He looks JUST like him. I’m a big fan of him, so it’s sad to see someone using AI to make fake Danny content. I hope Danny sees this channel and takes it down.😡😡😡
I still don't understand why he did it? Like it could be interesting to see what it was like to create a character and write songs from their perspective instead of your own, but he didn't write the music so it's essentially just dressing up
Does anyone know the song playing in the background at 3:57 :)  Edit: it also plays here 9:00 :)
Where are the bodies G??
I dont understand, is this your main chanel or something?
Tbf I think if someone like Taylor swift did this the fans would probably think its an arg or something I mean didn’t they already theorize that she wrote argyle with literally no basis
What if Greg pretended to be someone else?  Like..."Gerald" or something.  P.S. I've heard of this whole mini-kerfuffle before and it always came across to me like Garth Brooks was really, _really_ jealous of Kurt Cobain for some bizarre reason.
9:31 Danny, do you not remember when the “Look What You Made Me Do” music video dropped?? We were all confused!!!
Didn’t he do this like 20 years ago?
Was this before or after Garth tried to play professional baseball?
is the movie lost media?
Yo am I the only one who thought the Chris Gaines photo was on*s*on at first 😭😭
Where's the Watcher collab Danny?
"Who is Garth Brooks?" I'm still tryna get to know this Robert guy.
Do you think Joaquin Phoenix was inspired by Garth Brooks when he grew a beard and pretended to abandon acting and become a rapper as an stunt for a mockumentary or something?
Bro why tf he look like Onision
Anyone else see a lot of similarities to Keith Urban in Chris Gaines bio and look? Lol
We've now hit the Danny "Did you know about this??" content that makes me feel ancient because... yeah man I was like 10 when this happened.
Are we gonna talk about the fact that his alter ego low key looks like onision??
Why does the alter ego look like Onision
jesus the grab for content is wild.
How is he #1 at 157 mil when MJ sold 500mil?
I wonder if any celebrity has done this and succeeded
I can’t figure out if Danny is lying about Robert Schulz who I literally followed before I knew Danny existed😭
Danny, did you read anything about the people that go missing after Garth Brooks concerts? It’s apparently a repeated thing
Does anyone know.. yk.. nvm
is robert dave franco? is this the long con??
Did the infant maul ur neck
Wait Danny's 30?? Crazy stuff
Is Robert real?
why is he uncovering everybodys alter egos 😭
Oh wait Robert is real?-
Why is Onision a country singer in disguise?
So I’m an old Greg so I remember this happening. My memory was “Wait is that Garth? That’s Garth Brooks….are we not supposed to know what’s Garth Brooks? What’s going on?”
Why does the second pic in the thumbnail look like onision?
is this just me or was Chris Gaines in the movie zoolander, i've never seen them in the same room before
Wdym, that's not Danny, that's a real-life musician?? Gonna go listen to his hit-single Avocados and Cheese now :D
Where are bodies G? The families need closure
and why does the alter ego look like onision ☹️
How did Danny get Dave Franco to start collecting vids for him? kinda impressive tbh
Who is Robert
WHAT IS THE SONG THAT PLAYS AT 3:18??? I KNOW IT BUT I CANT REMEMBER THE NAME OR BAND
Is nobody ever gonna ask about robert
why does that alter ego photo look like onision 😭
Not sure if you want to turn this into a series or not, but you could also look at Stephen King and Richard Bachmann. King did it so much better!
What is the song at 3:19?
is robert a real person.. or is he just a bit…
3:00 Danny is that a big red Hickey on your neck? 😅
who is Robert 😭
i want to know orgin of face on thumbnail so bad
Okay, wait, I _am_ confused. Garth wanted to make a movie with this character and while they were making the movie they started concentrating on the character and its music more to the point they didn't even make the movie but that's it? It's just one album with this character and that's it?  Fans got mad because they got confused and that ruined his career?
and who the hell is this man
are we sure its actually was garth brooks and not just a five year old danny? CRITICAL THINKING GUYS!!
quadrangle video when?
Who?
can we get a robert cam on the top left of every video?
How come Robert looks like a Chad version of Drew Gooden?
Why is Robert Dave Franco?
donald glover covered that song???
i was watching a bunch of eddy burback videos on autoplay while playing subway surfers and this started playing? new danny video !
4:02 what has Danny been looking for on ebay? Cheese cards and a netal thing with London stamped on it
What do you mean you've never heard of the name Garth?! Did you never watch Wayne's World??
When are you admitting to the Mean Girls song on here?
Wenn will Danny finally make a Video about "Drew Gooden" being his alter ego??
Chris Gaines? Gains what? Chris Gaines deez nuts in his mouth?  We'll never know
When will this “Robert” just take over the channel
i was wondering how did i miss this random video by danny when i watched through all of them and even rewatched some and then realised it was posted 4 minutes ago
isn’t this whole concept just hannah montana?
Are u Garth Brookes?
Danny why do you sound different have you hit puberty?
