How long before rodgers gets injured this year?
But arent aging players prone to injury?  Hopefully he recover so he can retire playing.  Fans and media need to get back to reality when it comes to aging players.  Father Time is undefeated.
That’s a great “what if” in NFL history… what if Vinny doesn’t get hurt that day…
We needed help on the offensive line but we missed out on Jones; do we take the next best lineman available? No, we take another edge rusher. Anton Harrison gave up two QB pressures in his first game; not great but not bad for a rookie. How would he have fared against Floyd? We kept hearing all through camp that Brown, 38 and with declining skills, would be ready; he wasn't.
Why does he shout and speak so weirdly???
I wonder if that bar in Wisconsin is going to keep the free bar tab with every jets loss promotion now
You think the jets and giants opt out for real grass now?
Maybe this is the Bledsoe injury revisited...
What about the fact that the Twitter account that predicted Aaron Rodgers’ injury was suspended?
Did  NY Jets fans really expect to get to playoffs or Super Bowl this season just because Rodgers? I think with or without Rodgers they couldn't get to playoffs, not to mention the Super Bowl, that's a wild dream.
How many Achilles, ACL, MCL, before the NFL bans turf! The players need to strike!!!!
Where is Rogers backup Matt Flynn...
I'll give you another Rich..  Who wore the number 4, for the Green Bay Packers?
Are the Jets a baseball team from Japan? Never heard of them
I am just wondering why no one picked up Floyd on the fourth play of the game.  He had a clear run to Aarons blindside.  I think this was a bullshit play.  I honestly think their is more going on here.  But, who cares right!
call tom lol, then he breaks his leg in the first game..then what?
Is there an Emmy or Pulitzer category for whatever this is? Rich Eisen is a national treasure.
When’s the next senate hearing on uaps, ufos?
I could play, What do you want from us on a loop all day, sorry Rich. But this was great😂
LOL. Testeverde honorary captain??  Those fate tempting idiots!
Zack Wilson……..wonder how good he will be by the time he turns 18?
Anyone got Flacco's number?
Maybe Boomer should have been the captain?
3:15 "WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING THERE???"😯😯 LMDAO😂😂😂😂
To answer Rich’s question, “What do we do?” Not sure, but I know what you don’t do. Constantly telling Zach how bad he is won’t get you there.
We all knew it.   But the media lied for 12 hours saying it was an ankle and naming every other tendoned down there.  Why were they lying?  What was their benefit?
The first 4 snaps were ok - it was the 5th snap that was the problem.  Too soon?
Why not have all that get Tom energy go to your back up who helped win you that game last night.....
Tell us how you really feel RICH! Sorry for your loss.
Where is Mike White?
How come no mention of the missed penalty call on the punt return???
Rich - what was your favorite memory of Aaron Rodgers as a Jet? 😂
Do the NFL gods want Kaepernick back?
4 snaps, by number 8, who formally played as number 12... Irony?
Sorry Rich. Any thoughts to finally making MetLife grass?
Tom Brady to the JETS?!
It's all up to Rodgers if he wants to rehab and come back or call it quits 🙏🏾 I hope he gets well soon
Yeah, but did y’all win last night (and mess up my fantasy) or not?😂😂😂
How will the Jets lift the Joe Namath Super Bowl III Curse? What deal with the Devil did Namath make to get that victory??
hey did Rich see what happened to Aaron Rodgers?
Don't know why rodgers was carrying the flag out, he's a big 9/11 conspiracy theorist, maybe it was karma
Yes it was, the drama, the lead-in, then what??  horror show if there ever was one.
Rich and Chris, your next fantasy team name?  “Four Snaps”
How many ligaments and tendons have to be torn apart before we ban artificial turf?
When was the last time the Jets won a season opener? It's a stat that I literally cannot find and I'm genuinely curious.
By "football Gods" you mean the script writer(s) portrayed by Keegan Michael Key right?😊
Guess he should have gotten more pliability training.
Is anyone checking on Rich? 😅
Wonder why he didn’t bring up the jets season opener in 98?
What do the football gods want? They want Jet Fan to stop frigging whining and man up.
Are all Jet fans all psychotic??? Well, at least we know of one...eh, Richard?
Too soon to bring up Garrison Hearst? 😉
Is that the same calve he had issues in training camp.
When was the last time Detroit went to a playoff game let alone win one? 1907? So the Lions don't want to hear it.
Philip Rivers, Drew Brees?
How's Mike Greenberg doing? He alright this morning? Lol
Are they ever gonna fix the fucking turf at Met-Life stadium?
Ask Broadway Joe what deal he made with the Devil for his (in?)famous guarantee. Y'all truly are  a tortured fanbase.
What happened? The Jets put everything on black and then red came.
Rodgers gets sacked because the O-line coach refuses to block the way Rodgers wants and insists on cut blocks depending on the called play? Really?  Note to NY coaching staff: if you have a QB that changes the plays depending on the defense, you need to change blocking the way the QB plays, otherwise, your rigid stubbornness will get the QB hurt.  It would seem Rodgers play was too advanced for the OL coach to adjust accordingly.
Why did the Jets follow up a 26 yard run with three straight pass plays anyway? Not only just three straight pass plays, but the first two incomplete with pressure on Rodgers, got a first on a holding call and then on first down run another pass play where Rodgers gets sacked and blows achilles. Maybe Achilles ends up rupturing on the next play or next series or next game anyway, but still interesting play call strategy by the Jets
Was that a Goonies sound effect?
is Zach Wilson old enough to drive
Is this Matthew berrys cousin?
Already!? Lol
Does Aaron even play again?? That's a tuff injury for a YOUNG player to come back from, gezz Rogers is 40.... Poor Jets fans
Maybe ARod is the Obi-wan not the Luke Skywalker in this story.
Turf fields??
When does Carson Wentz get signed ? 😂 seriously though Jets have shocking luck
Man, who could have seen an old border line retired qb would get injured on a terrible terfed field with a terrible O-line vs a great defense. Who could have seen something like this happening?
What does God want from you? A field that doesn’t crave flesh.
How do I end up supporting the cursed teams. First Manchester United get injured to hell and back and now the Jets lose Rodgers.
Every time something happens with the Jets i wonder, what does Larry David think?
Maybe if he got COVID this wouldn't have happened ?
20 yrs? Who was gonna give u the other 18-19?😂 def not Wilson
That sounded like a different Zach. Humbled? Grown up maybe? Understands what greatness really looks like now and he wasn't it?
What happens if new QB goes 13-4 this year, does Aaron still take over the team next year?
Do you remember the Shining  .. lol
How bout that tripping no-call at the end of the punt return , even the resident ref. In the booth called it out on air ?
lions fan here. Anyone know who his last completion was too.? Ohh and. RODGERS DAHN!!!
Astroturf. Man. Maybe it's time to get rid of that stuff Jets? If you want your players to have achilles tendons intact.
You think Tom wants to play behind that offensive line?
I can’t think of a bigger wahmp wahhh in sports. All the hype. The build up. That one receiver retiring. The question is that pick situation. The Packer’s pick from the Jets is based on how much Rodgers played this year.
Rogers was clearly in shock; disbelief at the reality, then the immediate acceptance of the inevitable truth. What now, try to come back as an old man and flop, or drop the mic and bow out gracefully. Time will tell if pride will keep him or let him walk away head high. He’s not Brady, nobody is, it’s more realistic to just walk(or limp) away gracefully.

Is that or is that NOT one of the most New York Jets things ever?!  First thing I thought of when I saw what happened to A-Rod in his first-ever Jets game, I thought: "I'm listening to Rich Eisen tomorrow morning." I LOVED his theatrical opening monologue, great Shining reference, and damn you Vinny Testaverde! Call Tom Brady?! haha hilarious!
Why not give Carson Wentz another shot? He's gotta be better than Zach Wilson.
Does the phrase "snake-bit" mean anything to you?
Rich how about decaf coffee ?
Maybe Rich and Mike Greenberg can get a group rate for therapy.
How does Green Bay keep getting away with this? They get rid of HOF QBs just in time.
How do you really feel, Rich? That's not meant sarcastically - it's obvious how heartbroken he is as a result. When the hope you felt is so quickly dashed, man, it's rough. And the injury, not even a sprain or something that a few weeks off helps. Just - boom - season over.
Why not do this segment in his iphone? Love when media giants use pedestrian forms of broadcasting.
Q  What do you want from us ?           A    Grass fields
Who all was waiting for Rich's reaction?? Immediately afterwards thought about him. Brutal
Maybe the jets should stop dumpster diving for hired aging guns
Aaron…aaron. Why did u spin? Just take the sack man. U r 40 years old…..goshhhh.
I wonder what happened to all the asshats last night that were laughing and making fun of the team and saying Rodgers went down on purpose to not have to play. Funny how once there's confirmation of the injury everyone decides to say they're "devastated" or that it's "so unfortunate" despite wanting his and the Jets downfall for some odd reason.
Wtf is likens didnt know that was a word  do you not have to know how to spell or use real words to be a youtuber
No mention of the leg whip on the punt return?  Cmon.
4 snaps?  What took so long?
As a Pittsburgh Pirates fan, I wonder if it's better to have no hope at all, or to have hope only to have it snatched from you? Feel bad for Jets fans today.
Can Teste still play? 😂
What do the football gods want from us, you ask???  Anal. And they’ve been getting it for 54 f’n years…
So who are getting for a backup QB? I have faith in this team and zack Wilson as qb1
Not sure how much superstition gets involved when you put a 39 year old man, remarkable as Rodgers is, behind a poor offensive line.
Perhaps signing quarterbacks under the age of 39 is a better path to success?
With this type of injury at his age will this be the end for Aaron Rodgers. 😢😢😢
Did the New York Jets do something to the Gods in a prior lifetime? I mean, we are snake bitten!
Rodgers is 39 years old. The likely hood of an injury is increased for any older player. The Jets opted to go into this season with an insufficient back up QB. Was that decision made because of money? No viable candidates that are considered better than Wilson? Or did they just wing it and hope for the best. Regardless, the Jets weren’t prepared for this more than probable scenario.
Maybe get an O line before you invest in a QB? Kind of on the GM if you ask me...
At this point I gotta ask, what did the Jets do long ago to deserve this.  Did the owner make a deal with the devil to win that one Super Bowl, and since then has been paying the devils dues?
Do you think some guys were out for blood looking to hurt him...... I remember how Mahomes got hurt last year.....looked like the guy who tackled him was using his full body weight to tackle him......just like the tackle on Rogers.....
What's up with the rise in achilles tears in all sports In the last few years ???  I feel like growing up it was kind of rare  Now you hear about it all the time????
Four snaps… isn’t that Brett Favre’s number?
Maybe get rid of turf fields ?
0:39 was that the fucking back to the future noise
So sad for Rodgers. What will the Packers do with the second round pick they got next year?
Would Tom give up that potato chip money?
Can they sign Brady?
But do we really know its not Vinny's fault though? lol. Great opening story. Heart breaks for all Jets fans. I was looking forward to a Jets resurgence.
The question is can Aaron come back after losing a season of play and I'm sure tons of rehab and play for the Jets? Will he even want to? He'll be 40 or 41 This is just brutal for Jets fans and it looks like the Curse continues
Caleb Williams Sweepstakes got a new contender?
Is the field artificial turf...?
Forget all that BS how is Aaron?
did worry about all the uber hype of the last few weeks?? Hubris anyone?//
"What do you want from us?"  "Pain"  Feel horrible for Jets fans today, but there's no help on the was from the Football Gods.
Why couldnt this have happened to Russ?
Idk how much longer I can be a fan of this team. It’s like they rip all of my internal organs out of me every year
Any suggestions on what QB we should target.
Maybe they can convince him to be a QB coach for the rest of the year?
Are dick pics still a thing? Maybe AR can still contribute like Favre did.
Why did the Jets signed a 39 years old QB in the first place ? Rodgers will never play in NFL anymore.
But...how did AR and the Jets look on those 4 snaps?
Am I the only Jets fan who wasn't surprised at Rodgers' injury as it happened?  Part of being a Jets fan is knowing that whatever can go wrong, will go wrong.. We're not allowed to have nice things
Maybe the Jets can get Sam Darnold
Isn’t it a little weird that this happened basically on the anniversary of that other injury? The same thing happened to Alex Smith on the 30th anniversary to the exact day of Joe Theisman’s injury.
What type of horror film ??? Is this more like The Ring, or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or The Babadook? Or maybe Night of the Demons? 🤔🤔🤔
How long before fans start calling for a trade for Trey Lance?
Could this be defined as the Jets “Chargering”?
What do Aaron Rodgers & Kevin Bacon have in common? Footloose.
I see this video is 16 minutes long, so I'm wondering if there is some concern that by taking up so much air time to gush about Rodgers he might have influenced this outcome... At the very least this part is now fun to watch.
I want to see, if Aaron Rodger can summom his inner Alex Smith and rehab hinself back onto the field. I have my opinion, which is ... totally unimportant.
Welfare Check on all Jets fans
