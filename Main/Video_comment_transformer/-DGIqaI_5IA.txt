The plane crashes questions are top tier
4:50 wtf?? it's Blinding lights by the weeknd
4:50 wtf?? it's Blinding lights by the weeknd
Why's vik looking extra yellow
Who’s here after Nick avocado transformation 😂
58:59 nah that would’ve pmo like wym cancel the question!
W2S became Willie Revillame for the first question of the last round. But JJ got the best moment of all-time 🤣(If you know Willie Revillame, you know it)
21:40 Simon: what is a wombat  Australian's: 👁👄👁
I have to know do you boys get that money for real????
Who’s here after the new sidemen video
How are they so dumb?
the longest french border question was so painful to watch
Why tf is there so many ads bruvv
But u did surprise me with the three virgina question!! Maybe I spoke to soon good job. Never forget where u come from or who came up with u!!
Can anyone else hear Simon’s mic out of everyone else’s when he talks
41:36 why is there a random bevel added here?
French Guyana?
That Brazil question was answered four times by that one guy on my fyp
Behz is an LGTBQ+ icon? O.o?
Harry is so dumb for that French question and he thinks it’s they’re fault lol upsets me everytime
is that actual real money?
Did no expect that team to get the most money
Why was Ethan the lgbtq icon? I must of missed something 🤣🤣
Does anyone know what kind of sneakers Ksi & Tobi has on?
32:32 I like how all of them are like processing that ethan is on the question 😂
Why does ksi randomly wear glasses and sometimes don't?? does he have contacts on rest of the time??
The France question was so easy 😭
Bro, all of them have very basic general knowledge, some questions are super easy and they struggle 😅
Why was Ethan on LGBTQ+ question? I didn't get it.
okay, that french border question was bs, brazil does not officially border france, so calling it a french border is absurd, but the result was much funnier
first question was obvious
i was practically screaming tenerife at my phone on the plane crash question
Any die hard breaking bad fans knew the answer to the airplane crash question
What a really stupid question
The last question should've been plane crashed!
Of all the people harry could ask the vagina question to😂😂😂
When was the didn't ask bit?
The question about plane crashes was actually in the braking bad. They mentioned it in the school gym after janes dad crashed two planes
do they actually get the money lol or is it just for the camera
Bro are we sliding past the french question? If he would have said french territory it would have been so much more clear
What’s the noice on 35:49-35:51
I'd like to denounce the first question and it's atrocious answers.
4:50 shape of me....? 9:55,  19:50,  26:35, 32:50, 39:00, 56:30,
what is a wombat, i dont know, some form of a bat!!!! hahaha i fkn died
Can someone explain what the lgbtq joke meant?
never would have expected JJ and Ethan to win a quiz game
Can someone explain the French border question/answer? I looked up French Guinea and it's not even on the same continent as Brazil
Funny how the most replayed part is when the icons question ends😂
the question for LGBTQ icons i cant believe they asked a question about Ethan is hilarous with a question about Josh in Ancient History.
Wish I got mcqs on what's a Quark🙂, back in the school days
Viks geography question had me so angry 😂
It’s pronounced French guy-yana for those confused about the French border question
That French boarder question was a con, the Brazil-French boarder is around 730km long where as the USA-French boarder is nearly 9000km long... Canada is a french speaking country... another example of getting a reaction for content over the actual correct answer, making the gameshow completely redundant
36:30 that was the funniest question 🤣
The 2 kost unlikely duo to get money off of some questions
I don't know how this video didn't get more views, it's actually jokes!
Am I the only one who felt fat shamed by KSI? 😅😂
The avgeek in me screaming Tenerife at that question
Bro how do they pick up the board that dropped on the sides? That's been bothering me the whole video
The boiling point of milk question all answers are wrong lol
Why tf does it say shape of me???  Btw its not even close man, ed sheeran is dominating spotify rn
*question about French border appears*  Vik and josh: *Tactical Nuke Incoming!*
Symptoms of panic shown by W2S “Shi*” Walks around nervously  “Change the question 🙅🏻‍♂️”
10:57 wait they are the same thing right?
that france question was painful, can't believe the geoguessr nerds didn't know about frances enormous empire, DOM TOM innit 🤭🤭🤭  edit: obviously /lh 🙄🙄🙄
Shape of me? did JJ write these?
I love when Harry hosts and half the questions end up being about his interests and current hyperfixations lmfaooo
Harry: Change the question they know the answer Next questions they knew the answer too 😭😭
Bru I'm American and i got the geography question
I love how my country malaysia is in the question. And not even have related with french border 🤣
Am I the only one who knew the plane crash question becasue of breaking bad?
Technically ethan and jj answered 9 questions
Isn't French Guinea in west africa and brazil in south america tho?
Questions are always extremely easy or straight up impossible 😂
This sports question definitely wrong, the answer was basketball.
jj genuinely looked upset when no money was put on him for the mothers question, feel for the guy.
That question with the french border😑😑😡😡😡
Who pays them the money or do they not actually play for real money?
When they ask Vick for help with math pure
Ethan and JJ actually win a trivia game wow
HOW TF DO THEY NOT KNOW WHAT A WOMBAT IS???
do they actually get the money? or is that a lie
that french guyana question made me crazy how vik didnt know it lol
What was JJ laughing at at 20:44?
What in the holy god was this ending?😂😂😂😂😂😂
Everyone don’t want jj on their team but he’s alr won a mil with josh and has beat a few other games which the others failed at so idk?😁
No one got it when Harry asked a question for ancient history about zerka taunting him that he is old and from ancient -
Josh: These are not very intellectual questions, are they?
Tobi - what country popularises that sport? Asia
Vikk taking control of the question was weirdly attractive… Also Harry’s trousers😮‍💨
Wtf is dance monkey 🤣😭
lmao the way harry panics "zzz zz cancel the question they know the answer"
Me as an Australian got so mad at how long it took for them to answer the wombat one
Am I dumb or french guinea not in africa miles away from brazil ?
Shape of Me? what😂
did anyone notice "shape of me" in the 2nd question? xD
i cant believe how easy these quetions are.. it makes me uncomfortable when they dont know the answer
44:03 Why did the josh birthplace question come in ancient history 🤣😂
How did Ethan and jj manage this ?🤣🤣 what a plot twist
50:23 breaking bad refference?
People argue about "jj and ethan" having easier questions amongst them,  Remember, this is an brain memory tasks, not solving problems
Was the question not the biggest border with France, not a French territory therefore it should have been Monaco
Harry definetly took the longest french border question from youtube recommended lol
Where is the money coming from though, are they just paying themselves
frech guinea is in africa tho?
1:00:11 Why does everyone subconsciously know this?!
Is it not French Guyana not Guinea?
They dont know who nick avocado is?😂😂😂💔🙆🏽‍♀️
Do they actually win the money with these shows? It cant be right?
Where can I get the jacket ethan is wearing? It's not on their website
As an Australian- how tf do y’all not know what a wombat is ?
Am I the only one who doesn't find constantly calling another 20 something old, elderly, ancient, etc., not funny at all? Like, 30 somethings  aren't even old.
French Guinea hasn't existed since 1958 though?
is this real money
KSI having tics or what ??
What is that sound at 39:26?
really a jellyfish?
What got into Vikk this video.
The last question was made fr jj 💀😂
That French boarder question was worded so terribly. Unfair dude!
Funny how i knew the plane crash question based off mr white talking about it in school after the plane crash saying its not as bad as tenerife crash
Do an episode of QI
41:45 wtf this hint?!
Harry: which *simon* hit the crossbar first
How did they forget French Guinea, come on?
That final question tho LOL
Is this a dumb question? Do they actually get that money? 😂
Bro that lgbtq icon question lmaooo
hold up wait a minute why did jj know that
Knew the plane crash question cause breaking bad
Glad no one ever asked me Dogs or Maps, hardest question ever
What’s the music used in this?
The fact I thought about the one plane crash I know in history is the question that came up because it was mentioned in breaking bad 😭 shouted Tenerife the second I heard 2 747s
why tf is this in lockdownlifes hoardcore series playlist lol
Wait is this real money ?
how did i get on this i was just watching minecraft then it put me on this
That French question was shocking. Harry acting like everyone should know this. Awful question haha
What is Havenese? Havenese nuts in your-
i didn’t think they would answer two questions to even win
I don't know how this vid just have 6millions vues (still a big number but this video is jokes)
What is a Womat.  Harry idk it’s a
Harry that was a low blow for Josh and vik for that question quantum or the other one
my boooiisss. did the hard subjects, got the additional question. left with the most money with a massive lead. yes lads
Nick avocado is awful but I won't be surprised if there's drama from this question and their comments lol idc personally
To be fair jj and ethan had a fair square right answer! But i think they had the easiest question.
Do Behzs and ks oui keep the money?
Vikk and Josh actually had difficult questions
All Canadians are in pain watching the question about the french border
which sidemen reacts was the kangaroo question from for research purposes of course
French guinea is in Africa and Brazil is in South America. What?
TBF they had a difficult 1st question. Plus the others were also hard. They deserved the last question.
Could someone explain how French Guinea borders with Brazil? Are they not on 2 different continents??
The French gunei was a question I was sure vik and Josh yould get 100% and Bois would be mad and all  It turned out Harry outplayed vikk and Josh and a bit himself 🤣
The bp question triggered me so much
I know this is offtopic but Is there anyone here from the USA?? I need a small favour regarding gmail account.
am I the only one that saw Vik wink at jj at 32:00
Why was Harry just obsessed with plane crashes he seemed way to happy when that category came up
As an Aussie, I’m proud these boys got the wombat question right, cubed poo for the win 🥇
Was josh tryna be annoying? Vik carried frfr
Where is the Mario kart promised 10months ago?
The funny thing is they Ethan and Ksi knew all the questions the other teams didn’t know.
Vik and Josh : Quantum physics  JJ and Ethan : What is W2Ss best gocart lap
10:44 how does Vikk figure that out on the spot?
Do yall actually get the money or it's just fake hype
What was that edit at 40:21 ?
The French border question 🤣🤣🤣
Was very surprised when Harry asked what his dog was and none of the options said “Rosie”
French Guinea's in Africa and Brazil's in South America so colour me confused
the milk question was wrong since he said it was rounded to the nearest so it should of been 101
What is wrong with the sidemen atm their content is great but it’s not getting the views #arethesidemendead
Question :- which animal has 3 vaginas???  JJ:- I know this....  Me:- Of course, he knows this 😂😂
The Kangaroo question wasn't SidemenReacts, it was the What's Good Podcast 😂😂😂😂
How does jj manage to finess in all these videos and win ps 😂😂
I knew the answer for the plane question instantly thanks to Breaking Bad.
Is there a frontman out there?
why was vik so mad
Was Ethan to short to sit on the chair
Ik I'm late but are vik and tobi are they mates again or but can some pls let me know bc I'm so confused 💙💜
Tobi: “What country popularized that sport?”  Also Tobi: “Asia.” 🤣🤣

The question about the french border was easy af 💀
Has no one noticed there's something going on with josh n simon

"what is a wombat?" "A kind of Pokemon" 💀
Ngl the Ethan “LGBTQ ICON” question caught me so off guard😹😹
Why does it always take me three days to watch a Sunday video I would never know.
Question Category: Acient History All of them: gotta be about Josh.
Why was the spelling of "Kangaroo" different on the monitors?
How do they not know what a Wombat is
The first plane crash question was the one Walter White talked about in his insane speech in Breaking Bad, the boys forgot a legendary television scene
When he read the 3 Vagina question straight after cancelling the previous q I laughed so hard knowing he finessed it straight from a reacts 🤣🤣
Can anyone link me the jacket Ethan is wearing
4 bands on Malaysia for that french question 😭😭
I thought the dog breed question was a setup for 'havenese nuts'
38:05 KSI- Harry, what was that
How the hell woukd the question be answered if ethan knew the answer isnt that the point😂 its amazing when the videos get shithoused i love it
What does spooning mean im not from uk
The French border question was so confusingly worded and the country that borders is French Guiana not French Guinea lmao
14:00 That was an easy Breaking Bad question
That french border question was worded so stupidly. Like bro "french border" = border with the country France
did tobi call asia a country???
Anyone else find it freaking hilarious that a lgbtq question had to do with Ethan? Lol
38:02 the way JJ says "Harry?? What was that?? " Like meh mum speakin🤣🤣🤣
whoever wrote these questions is the goooooat
couldn't believe the moment Josh and Vik put money on 3 options of a Geography question and managed to get all the wrong options
why the f did it say shape of me????
I was in pain witnessing Josh and Vik failing the Geography question 😭
I loved that geography question cause it was such a mindfuck. I immediately said Brazil though cause of French Guiana 😂
Omfg as an Australian I am dying here while watching the wombat question. ITS CUBED!!! Aaaaah how do they not know it lol.
Do they actually keep the money?
When is the new Tinder video comming?

Can someone explain the geography question that vikk and Josh got because I don’t understand how French Guinea shares a border with Brazil ?
Bro what is their budget on these videos 💀
I really thought jj and ethan will suck in Q&A but they literally smashed it🔥
We not gonna talk about the spelling of Kang"e"roo? Lmao. Right on the big screen wrong on the small screen
39:27 wtf is that sound
I was waiting for the kangaroo question the hole video since he said he was going to ask it on what's good podcast 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Josh asked the spotify question on stream right?
How many people play basketball outside USA? Vik broo
im actually curious who builds these sets, or where they go to film this stuff
french guinee??? *guyana!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Do they actually keep the money ?
If there are 4 answers to choose from it’s harder
Simon: what is a wombat? Harry: it’s some type of bat
That's why josh asked that same question on stream
Can we talk about JJ’s drip with the glasses?
do sidemen try to fasting
whats the discount code?
Does anyone know what reacts the jellyfish is  in?
Can I just ask what Harry's trousers are?

What woulda thunk that the team of JJ and Ethan would know the most trivia
anyone else know the Tenerife one from breaking bad?
who put 50p in vik?
what shoes is jj wearing
Someone explain the lqbtq icon joke???
Odds on the sidemen giving me a cheeky 25 bags ?
Josh and Vikk's reasoning for the French border question was painful to watch.
am i being silly or was it real money
14:20 did anyone notice KSI’s blinking…?
The French border question made me so mad AAAAAH
Who else after Tobi and Simon won searched up a wombats poop?
was that a freestyle? 57:10
JJ and Ethan are such an entertaining duo to watch do trivia questions together
The answer hasn’t been revealed yet but it’s Brazil
Harry what happened to supporting Chelsea?
the last two questions are heaven.
Im just wondering how they get this money
Nah im sorry but how did vik and josh not know that?  Also Ethan and JJ deserved the win
Why is JJ wearing glasses?
why is being part of the lgbtq community considered a joke? i like the sidemen but that was just insensitive
Why the hell is it shape of me 😂😂😂
Ik that plane question from breaking bad lol
they actually win the money?
Is it real money?
Bruh i laughed so hard when they asked Ethan's favorite game under LGBTQ Icons 😂💀
Do they actually keep the money?
The last question their moment was tooo coldd
17:56 how’s laugh is that?
Is anyone noticing sidemen are making couple of videos in one dressup??? maybe they are shooting those in one single day!
the last question remind me of the other trivia vids when jj team up w josh, where the last question is related to josh 😂😂😂
Sometimes its just hurts watching them get really easy questions wrong
That question at 39:00 was the dumbest question ever asked, so complicated and not understandable
This was amazing having watched that  video where they talked about the 3 vaginas to then see the last question 😂😂😂
Jj and ethan were balling hard on those questions real well.
Yo is KSI ok? He’s blinking quite hard during Simon and Tobis turn
first off, great video i love the sidemen, but is it just me or does anyone else notice that table tennis has alot less fans then basketball globally, roughly 850million people are fans of table tennis globally whereas roughly 2.2billion people are fans of basketball globally
Why does JJ look so good with glasses ?
Even with 2 final questions
I wonder if they film, edit, and post all on Sunday or if they do it ahead of time
Always LOVE these Trivia based videos!!!
A good day/trivia for JJ and Ethan
is harry wearing Pyjama bottoms ?
The French border question was an absolute stitch up 😅
4:46 Shape of me?
when harry realized he got scuffed either way in the last question lol
who tf wants pounds. dollars are way better
Who doesn’t know that music question cmon
I can't see properly so what brand is zerkaa wearing
Anyone know what jackey viks got on??
How tf do use not know what a wombat is  🇦🇺
ngl but I instantly got the French border question
Ethan getting question related to milk again 🤣🤣😂
Did anyone realise that for the milk question 100.5 rounded to the nearest degree is actually 101
Is Nikocado Avacado actually 5'6? I know Google says he is, but he doesn't even look short.
Leave the question and the answer on the screen next time...
That 'LGBTQ Icons' question at 32:20 was BRAZY LMAOOOOOOOO  I was confused for a sec
Jj gets smart only at the dirty questions
Asking JJ quastion about Pu**ssy 🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣 K for Knowledge
does JJ normally wear glasses
Wtf how did Tobi and Josh fail at the geography question. France doesn't border Malaysia or USA,monaco is a microstate,and the only long border they have is Brazil. Bruh moment.
Am I the only Aussie watching…. DO PEOPLE NOT KNOW ABOUT WOMBATS!!😂😂 @sidemen
Does anyone else find it funny that JJ always end up winning any contest containing money😂🤣
“wait harry, what was that” 😂😂 jj is to funny
Do they actually get the money
How are they getting these questions wrong lmao
"What is a Wombat?" Me an Australian: 😕
Eating food while watching sidemen is great, except when the final question is about poo.
How in gods name, did JJ and Ethan come out with the most money 🤔🤔🤣🤣
Will boutta slap Simon and tobi if they get the question wrong
Are those stacks of money Real? XD
Is it just me or is JJ maturing ?
14:50 wtf was that ghost voice that kinda laughed?? seemed out of place
Why was vik ignoring Josh's suggestions and acting like a c*nt? Mate have some respect
JJ got me doing a standing ovation on that last question, what an icon!
Is it just me or is Miniminter a lowkey b*tch, always saying some sly comment about his mates
as a fellow plane crash documentary enjoyer i was malding at the tenerife accident question :DD
how did this not get into my homepage
Love how JJ and Ethan improved in trivia questions love the content
JJ actually for once take w from me in trivia
Am I the only one to see 'Shape of me'?
Is that real money or are my eyes disabled
Are we gonna talk about how they copied foot asylum?
bruh how tf boiling point of milk same as water? yall stupid af
Harry casually wears a pair of pajamas with a suit
Don't know why but the question category asked for vikk and zerkaa was unfare bro 😬
They should totally do a family feud asking side+ the questions
how do these guys not know anything about politics in 2022? kinda sad tbh, they could influence a change with the fanbase they have.
Who else knew the airplane crash question from Breaking Bad?
The first question tho😂😂 Atleast they r not afraid of getting in the slap scandal and roasting it openly
French Guiana? French Guinea doesn't exist any more and was in Africa!
Josh: These are not very intellectual questions, are they? Harry: Hold my *quantum physics*
How could an animal have cubed poo
Unfair vik and Josh questions were really hard compared to the rest
What am I hearing at 23:43 and at 22:58? I didn't sign up to dis lol
Love Harry trivia
Question about milk appears: Ethan:😰
I was absolute spamming Tenerife in my Mind for the plane crash question
What did Tobi say in the initial moments?
The answer to that french border question is not French Guinea, it's French Guiana. French Guinea is in Africa, French Guiana is next to Brazil.
Harry: Ask the Animals question..  JJ: wait wait wait wait, i know this Hahahahaha, i know thissssss !! Sidemen reacts !!! HAHAHA DROP EM !!
Do they actually get to keep the money tho?
First question already got me dying😂
During the music one I love how they were like "Don't look at jj!" I never thought there would be a day when ppl would rely on him for a answer in a quiz
Did they do a discount code this sunday i didnt hear idk if i missed it or not
1:00:07 Shoutout to Simon's What's Good podcast for this gem of a question
"cancel the question"
what about Louisiana? It's the largest one with the USA.
Jokes aside, JJ and Ethan are really good at general knowledge and trivia
Question is… will JJ Split or steal the money
Trust jj to know the answer to the last question
The way Harry starts to scurry away yelling “Cancel the question!” Made my day
Harry was wearing the same suit in calfreezy's new vid, how come jj wasnt with them🤔
Can't say there questions were easier when they all had the same questions, it's all on the matter of which category they chose. Fair play to all them lot they put up a show.
That Brazil question with vik and josh, I learnt about that yesterday so it was mad funny seeing that drop, aii😭😅❤️
Falling off??
The quark question had two correct answers… they are charged particles that when combined create protons and neutrons
these guys just asked what a wombat was
Shape of me?
Too many questions honestly. Should’ve been shortened so they could keep more. Maybe like 3 less questions
That geography question was so easy... can't believe josh and vik got it wrong, insane
Discount code?
Why is Simon such an instigator😂
that French question was bs and hurts me as a Canadian cause Canada counts a a French speaking country therefore a French country and its border with the us is about 10 times that of Brazil, French guinia border
I’m sure google is currently wondering why so many people are searching up and suddenly interested in Kangaroos having 3 vagina’s
LGBTQ Icons: What is Ethan…  💀🤣💀🤣💀 I can’ttttttt
1:00:41 how did they misspell kangaroo
The geography question was so easy that was poor
bruh those questions got mad later on :D
how did it take them so long to know what shape a wombats poo is
Shape Of Me????? 4:45
i died at the mothers question and lgbtq icons
wait, why is it not in 4k?
Shape of me ????
How does kJ always win money 💰
But does French Guinea still exist today? Since the question asks "has the longest French border", i.e. Present tense?
Isn't it french Guiana??
Harry is a bog for cancelling the question for ethan and jj lool
why they chose plane crashes over politics I will never understand
why does Simon pretend to be dumb to be funny. bros like 30 and went private school
Tbh vik and Josh had harder questions poor lads 😂😂
what happened to the collab they were gonna do in the U.S?
Is the sound muted? Or is it my phone problem?
*how can they afford this?..….. Side+*
Anyone see shape of me😂
JJ and ETHAN has improved in trivia a lot.
What is a wombat? A type of bat  Australia: ????
Havanese and shitzu are way to similar wtf was the question for josh and vik
The USA border with Quebec is like 100km longer than the French Guiana-Brazil border, so if the question was about places where french is spoken, Josh would have been right!
Idk y but i felt proud when they asked vik is it less chance or more chance 😂
Harry finally got to use the Kangaroo question from the What’s Good Podcast
Why is there no more sidemen discount code
footasylum?
always jjs team with the last question clutch when harry is the host
Bruh I thought Ethan and JJ were gunna get stuffed 😂 turns out they literally couldn’t get the last question wrong 🤣
What happened to Ethan's face
I thought it was Hilarious that JJ and Ethan both knew one of their final questions forget the tension lol that was great who’s dumb now!!!!!!
I didn’t know the answer to the air craft question and I’m an aviation engineer lol
i’m so confused, do they actually get the money?
What’s the intro music name
Do they actually get the money
Talk about trying to change the view of Ethan and JJ being dumb by giving them the easiest questions to make them look smarter lol
why is the questions easier for the dummer ones?
What sidemen react video did JJ know the answer to the kangaroo from?
Random question, where in the Uk can I find a female kangaroo ?
i am liking this vid just because ethan and jj won a trivia video 😂😂
Harry's question/answer absolutely makes 0 sense
as a history and geography major, i don’t think i’ve screamed more than when the brazil question came up
how does jj always win these lmao
Is no one gonna talk about the LGBTQ question
Cancel the question they know the answer 😂😂😂 only in the Sidemen the real show would never
Do they actually keep this money?
I would like to know if they actually give the money to the winners?? I'm assuming it's just for the video and they just put the money back in their bank accounts. Haha
harry should take charge og game show from now on. Questions are Jokes LMAO
This is low key sidemen roasting each other
Do People out side of Australia really not know what a wombat is
Did anyone realise Bermondsey is spelt different on the show or is just me...   Maybe they should introduce a Sidemen spelling test or bring it back !!
Ancient history: where in London was Josh Zerkaa born?😂😂😂 daymn
Am I the only one here that thought Ethan and JJ’s round was going to be a complete joke
guys this video is great another great video but along side with the questions maybe a small video regarding to the question( like in the fat guy video) like the question about jj crossbar.
Omg Vik and Ethan, I’m shocked . That was a tough question
"what is a Wombat" Australians are mad rn
The category is LGBTQ icons. The question- "What is Ethan Behzinga Paynes favorite video games"  Lmao underrated roast for sure
Someone watched zerka stream to get that wombat question someone told josh in gta 😂
Classic Harry, Using trick questions learnt from sidemen reacts channel loool
Why’s Tobi wearing H3 pattern
was a clip cut out at 20:46??
tbh why even watch it when the questions aren't fair.
Give us sidmen tinder   Or stephantries vs 20 women
Do we actually think they got the money though
All Australians at the wombat question
Josh know why the shape of the wombats poo is cos of gta Rp lmao
Do they mean French Guiana?
Josh gained weight ? Looking better than the rest
Harry took it personal when Vik at Josh got their question wrong🤣🤣
josh got the wombat question told to him in RP last week 😂
ngl the questions werent that hard-
And I though Americans were supposed to be bad at geography. The two smartest sidemen. That’s like one of the most common geography questions ever. Plus French Guiana isn’t even a territory it’s an overseas department. It is straight up France
I love how they all match shoes with other person like was it planed? And absolutely love watching y’all’s videos there always enjoyable❤️
Why is it always Tenerife?
This was so sick until the last round. Harry just ruined the questions. Kept the hard question for others. Then ruined all tension in it.
Do the goats reply tho?
Nah, nah. Harry stiffed Vikk/Josh with the ‘largest French border’ question.  The wording of that question was confusing and stupid.
How did I know the plane crash question wtf 😂😂😭
Last questions were perfect for Ethan and JJ. One was Ethans video, and the other was a question about vaginas.
My grandad passed away just over two weeks, i’m wondering if anyone will send some donations for collection happening at his funeral
No offense or anything just wondering, Do they actually take the money though?
The first question was a bit distasteful I must say
Is Canada owned by France? Was that a serious question?
Being a geography nerd and watching the border question is a pain
Where did josh get that gillet can’t find it on sdmn clothing
Just love how jj and Ethan both knew the last question
Canada isn't owned by France so why did they picked that
The internet has ruined me my first thought about the political question was oh if sadiq barely survived a plane crash it was probably a hijacking fail probably my humor is way to dark sometimes
Ethan what a legend in the last question
I knew the French border question I would have put straight up all on it
The LGBT Icon question killed me 😭😭😭
POV looking for nico Avocado in the comments
im still confused by the French guinea question...shouldnt it have been USA's border with Quebec as the correct answer? 39:25
harry should have known that jj would know that last question
Am I the only one that googled wombat poo?
Yo why did it say Kangaroo on the board but Kangeroo on the monitor seems like the sidemen don’t know how to spell after all those spelling bees
Am I nerd if I knew the plane crash one?
great video again, though i feel like the shithousery on the french border question was stupid to the point where it just made the rest of the video slightly less enjoyable for me
what happened to jj why is he blinking like that
Wtf is that set? 😂
that last question was so lucky, the only time jj wasn't asleep in a reacts
46:56 wtf why he try push the money Maybe old habit never die

Josh gray hair or was it just me?
Vik is a baller and be going all in the questions
woot 2 of these questions i found yesterday xD because of some person had an incident and i fiound a cube bomb in the toilet of an Human :O sooo massiveee
Jj and Ethan had such easy questions
1:00:30 bro jellyfish don’t have any vaginas what is that question
1080p what happened to 4K? but… the video was still good!!
5:55 shambles of a music question  19:54 didn't ask 😬 20:46 Simon's mum is an animal😱 32:55 wii fat 🤣😭 39:07 one of the dumbest moments by sidemen🤦🏾‍♂️ 52:18 tobi did jj dirty 🤣🤣🤣🤣 58:57 cancel the question  1:00:31 harry face and they still won
Who else looked up wombat poo?
1:40 Imagine if the question for ancient history category was “What’s Josh’s birthday?”  Edit: I GUESSED IT BASICALLY
Is that real money
I died laughing when the "LGBTQ icons" question was about Ethan
On the last question JJ really utilised knowledge
How is no one talking about how late they uploaded it fair enough if they had problems but that's mad still
The lgbtq icon question from harry was brazzy lmaoo
what glasses r jj wearing?
I’m just really curious is it fake or is it actual money
what happened to jj's eyes??
KSI always win this harry quizzes
I love it when Harry is the game show host of the video, he always makes the best questions and answers 😂
I almost spit my drink out at the last question 🤣
I wonder if they acc get the money or if they put it all back into their account
French guinea? Bro it’s French Guiana 🇬🇫
IF THERE WAS SUBSCRIBER IN THE GAME SHOW THRY EARN MONEY WHERE ARE THEY
How much money did Vik lose from other Sidemen members? 🤣
Bruh that last question for vik and josh was bs
Idk if it's a good idea to flash a million to the public but that's just me
Watching Josh and Vik lose on a question i knew was painful 😭
Anyone else wanna bring back side craft?
-Harry "Who won the 1st 10K calorie challenge?" - Ethan " Oh, I know this" *Has to change the answer to something harder - Harry "What animal has 3 vaginas?" - JJ "Oh I know this" 🤣
why do they all say table tennis like that like where did they get it from is there like a meme or something
The LGBTQ icon question on vik & Josh was the most Savage Violation I’ve seen on a Sidemen video lol
That french border question was jokes, Malaysia couldn't be further from any of the french territories 😭
shape of me?🤣
Can't put a question about p***y and expect jj not to know the answer  (R*pe face)
31:00 was that a ethan coming out of the close video ???
I love how they're just looking up at a wall. Do they actually expect us to believe there is a massive semi-circle screen there?
It’s actually ”French Guiana” but good question still !
pretty sure nikocado isnt 5' 6", i think he is over 6'
Discount code??
what kinda jacket is ethan wearing. which collection is that?
No one: Le Harry: CANCEL THE QUESTION
HOW TF DO THEY NOT KNOW ABOUT FRENCH GUIANA???? France and Brazil is thousands of miles away from me but I knew about it.
idk man i feel kinda bad for vik and josh even if harry is helping em a tiny bit they are ggetting the hardest questions so far plus harry helped simon and tobi a bit too and no one complained
Did anyone notice on 10:10 Jj twitching? Hope he’s good though
When JJ and Ethan got BOTH the Final questions correct...  We all liked that! :)
JJ wearing glasses again?
Did I actually just hear Vikk being called BIG MAN twice bro?😂😂
Sidemen reacts is low key messing up these gameshow videos. They are getting too smart with random general knowledge questions
That French question was not explained properly. They got confused between French speaking and France. Harry should have clarified that he's talking about France.
Vik:How many people play basketball outside the US.  Everybody except UK
why viki and josh got harder question
I swear that jj wins every trivia game😂😂
I wasnt surprised that ethan got that milk question correct, since he answered that chase question
Fun fact - Harry wrote the kangaroo question from Whats good podcast
Vik did well. That french border question was unfair.
Was it just me screaming Brazil at vik and Josh ?
is it finally acc money that they get to keep? feels like it is
I wonder how many people searched up what wombat poop looks like...
This is the 2nd time JJ is on the same team as someone who's on the winning question🤣🤣
Can anyone explain me the LGBTQ icons joke?
Wait KSI really used his K in this vid wtf 🤯
Wait im confused
How have they not done hole in the wall yet 😂
that french border question was a catastrophy
Do they actually get to keep the money or do they act that they get it. They are rich enough to pay themselves that money.
Okay but where can I get that jacket Ethan is wearing???
Is that the sidemen doing a remy brown impressions. Never Drown with Remy Brown.
275k won by jj and ethan?
why is sidemen x mrbeast still not a thing
I knew the wombat question immediately
The music question I was screaming shape of u
we all know why  vik and josh got difficult question.... becuz they are the brains in the sidemen
Vikk ignoring Josh and going all in on a question was gold, Vikk is a money man fr fr
The real ones know that the last question is from the what's good podacast
What country makes table tennis popular? Toby .... -Asia.   LULW
Last question threw me so off guard😦
Harry should’ve said French Guinea in the question as it just said French, so they thought France
the money is actually paid?
The French border question is exactly what you’d expect from a Harry question. It makes me love and hate him hosting
Why was the lgbtq question about ethan??
I'm legit disappointed that Vik and Josh didn't get the French guiana question
How is it that the dumbest pair win the most money??
Love these quiz videos
Should have asked Ethan what cows drink.
Finally a question about Nick avocado, and even sidemen knows that he's killing himself and many people have told him to eat to much food. I hope Nick avocado is going to stop eating to much food and realise that he's eating alot of food.
Ethan and JJ winning trivia is a Golden moment!
Is the money real
Asking a Vegina question to KSI GG
Who would’ve thought Ethan and JJ would’ve hit new levels of knowledge for that last question? The two hardest questions and they knew the answer to both questions.
dicount code? i can't find it   i watched all the video
Simon and Tobi's music question was easy though.
That France question was bs I would have picked the US as well
How did they choose japan ? Like if theres a city name, its the city 😂 theres no "Japan" airport, but surely it's a tenerife one
I knew exactly what question Harry was gonna ask in the plane crash one
why are there moaning sounds at random intervals in the video
how is posible that our fatneek still winning
ethan and jj slumpdog millionaired the last question damn
anyone wanna explain the connection between lgbtq icons and ethan's favorite games? I didn't get the joke
Did JJ and Tobi plan their outfits
How in the heck did that happen lmao 🤣🤣
Ethan come to Harry with jokes on his mom, but he got the last laugh with the LGBTQ+ Icons question 😂
Hold on a minute I recognise the background? 🤔
Man included Ethan in the the icons question😂😂😂😂😂😂
Harry changing the final question because because Ethan knew the answer - if he wanted guesses all along there were quite a few other questions someone knew the answer...
what are wombats ☹️, ogs in Australia
4:45 Shape of me?
Cancel the question had me dead😭😭
How come the richest always become richer!
55:51 when josh asked which is it every inch of my brain said harry is gonna say well idk lads Ethans dad never brought it back yet
Someone, anyone, please tell me why ETHAN picks his nose in just about every video??? 🤣🤣
can somebody fill me in with the table tennis accent joke??
What the hell is French guinea?
That geography question with France lmaoo...how did they miss that, especially Vikk and Josh
41:36 what’s that box around for? For framing the scene?
This is the 1st time seeing JJ using K(Knowledge)in one of sdmn videos 🤣🤣 and the last 2 questions had me rolling 🤣🤣 and their reaction was priceless 🤣🤣
do they really get the money plz be honest prob not right lmao
I remember Harry saving that last jj and Ethan question from what’s good podcast
JJ and Ethan GOT cheated with the final question !!!
france border question was easy as hell, disappointed vik didn’t know that
Josh and Vik were jokes in this vid. The LGBTQ question is amazing.
Is Josh’s vest for sale somewhere!? Does anyone know!? I saw XIX on it....
Banger! Lol. JJ clutch! He did a madness on Behz with the politics question though. 🤣🤣🤣  Also, lol at the misspelling of Kangaroo on the answer screen at the end. There is no e in Kangaroo.
Yeah who’s the smartest??😂😂 big up jj and Ethan!!!
french guinea😭😭 isnt it french guyana??
How do they not know French Guyana man, my brain is hurting so much😂
Simon and Tobis first three questions were all easy af
The LGBTQ Icons question was on another level
I wanted to know why harry wore suit when I saw him on Cals Prime car video.. Now I know XD
Secure the bag?
38:37 why are they slapping the poor chair lmao
Anyone else think Josh lowkey sounded a bit Tommy T in this video?? in a good way ofc but i felt like Tommy T was playing with vikk 😂😂
I still don't understand the French border question 😶🙁
Imagine if Will actually came to UK and slap whoever got the wrong answer in question 1.
My real question is "Do they REALLLY get the money after?"
Who’s LGBTQ and when did he get an Icon
Am I wrong, or is it French Guyana not French Guinea?
I have a question what has a boiling point of 60 because i instantly said 60
Ofc ksi knew the last question
shape of me?
the game was rigged against Josh and Vik, especially the French border question lol
Since when did JJ need glasses?
what happened to ethan’s face ?
Where did Harry get the numbers for the question at 20:00 ? Because pretty much every website stated the top three sports as Football, Cricket then Basketball
Am I the only one that is curious why Ethan and his favorite game was under LGBTQ Icons category???😅
why is the video only 50 fps
17:43 wtf is that face tobi
How does Simon not know where Tenerife is lol
What is the discount code
Do a sidemen higher or lower with money.
Ethan being the LGBTQ+ Icon question took me out
Why they copying Teddy Fresh hoodie?
French border question was so dumb  😂
Is it weird I knew the plane crash one?
I actual new the French border question and sorry for my other comments just banting about
That dog question,  vik was sickkk
The first question is beyond cringe. Love the Sidemen but for real.  She’s NOT bald because of it.  It was her choice.
17:55 wtf is that background noice lmao
I’m still confused on why lgbtq went to Ethan’s fav video game 🤣
Anyone else know the plane crash answer from breaking bad (Tenerife question)
When I saw Harry dressed like this in freezys latest video I wondered what they were up to.
Simon: What’s is a wombat? Harry: Some sort of bat
The spoon your mother question had me dying🤣 I would choose Vik ofcourse!
20:40 ahh what was cut out 😭
i like how the questions were actually funny and not dead
really wanna know what the LGBTQ icon question was
why is jj wearing glasses. he looks too smart
4:47 Shape of me?? 😂
Does anyone know where to get Ethan's jacket from? I can't find it on sidemen clothing
Does anyone know if the sidemen actually get the money they win?
Anyone else remember the plane crash was Tenerife from Breaking Bad Season 3
anyone know what happened to Josh left eye/side of head
The moment harry brought up the plane crash question I already knew the answer before he brought up the answers
18:06 what is going on with Jj lmao 😂
Mateee so happy to see a bit harder physics question for the bois
Like how they ask Vik for verification of their Math xD
Yo why is JJ wearing glasses lately?
Do they get to keep the money? I know the answer is not but they were puting enough attention in it
bro when are they going to do one with PewDiePie and jacksepticeye
Is there going to be will smith joke?
4:45 shape of me? lmao
Like genuinely is this the first time Knowledge has wore glasses without playing another character?
Finally a game show
Will Smith out here about to take part in the next Sidemen slap game for that first question🤣😭
Surprised they didnt have someone walk up and slap one of them during the Jada question
Why is JJ wearing specs?
Has anyone bought JJ’s new Adidas shoes?
How many videos did they film on that set
WHO ELSE LOVES THE SIDEMEN!
I wonder who gives the million? Who provides? Similarly with who wants to be a millionaire they did
When is the tinder video coming out.
Does anyone else absolutely love when the boys do a TV show format?
How can multiple people be first, it doesn't seem to work like that.

How is everyone? :)

Do the sidemen reply ??
I’ve never heard of this show is it American?
Like if they should do a split or steal 2
Is this the first time all of them are here in a while?
Was it just me or was everyone bored
WHO ELSE LOVES THE SIDEMEN?!
Wonder what happened to Harry's channel
How is everyone’s day
