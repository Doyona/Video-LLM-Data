I wonder if The Kraft Heinz Company sponsored his apparel 🤭
Why does this guy sound like Dhar Mann?
So did he play with KG are not ?  If you didn’t know Adam Sandler like basketball you haven’t seen many of his movies.  Adam Sandler the 🎥 🐐.
Maybe the Lakers can trade Kuzma away and recruit Sandler

Good passer but why can't white guys play defense?
Anyone know what brand basketball goal it was?
Why would he put a laundry basket on the set
Is this the same drip from grown ups 1
Will he ever be able to buy good acting skills?
wow does he pay those other players to not play defense on him...😅...cause I'll take some of that cash and let him shoot buckets in my face all day...
I wonder if these guys know that Adam's Net Worth is around $430 MILLION Dollars!!!!  The dude dresses and acts like a typical dude wanting to play hoops....love this guy!

Why the hell he look so small
Isn't Adam Sandler a trump supporter? Correct me if I'm wrong
Who is this person so mad lol
Watch the video closely  I asked the question why are the opponents playing so lazily it seems like there taking it easy on him I'm not saying Adam Sandler doesn't seem to have some skill and I'm not saying every young black man is a superhero on the court but something seems odd about the energy on the court anyone who's ever played basketball to win would know what I'm talkin about
