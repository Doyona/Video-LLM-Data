Isn't this likey or I'm not watching the same game?
Did anyone see Javier the tiktoker in the crowd?. i am sure he wud be so sad coz he knew valencia lost to RM🤣...those who dont know he is stuck in 2027😂
Well now seeing all of these games let's ask this hard question 🤣🤣🤣, WHO HAS BETTER LUCK, CADIZ FC OR REAL MADRID??? before ya get pissed off i wanna say that CADIZ gets more luck because they play shit with 20 percent of possession every game and still manages to get points. If your from Barca or Madrid you know that from last year. But still Madrid has to score more goals in first half. Less than 5 this season in first half.
Is it just me or Casemiro been playing a bit bad lately?
What's with late goals from real 🤦if you look at every match they had they always score in the 85+min
How many goals Benzema have?
so people will continue ignoring anceloti's print on real madrid?
Bruh why does Madrid always have last minute goals..
i see everybody talking about vini and camavinga  But how come nobody mentioned hazard That man is a beast in the midfield
Whats all think about mamardashvili?🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪
Am i the only one who noticed that the Valencian goalkeeper completely annihilated his teammate on KB9 goal ? Bro i'm dead hahaha
