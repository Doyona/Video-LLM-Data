Reporters: are you football player? Mendy: nooO...i'm vloger 🎉
The defense is very weak What will mancity do against Liverpool?
Do they deserve the love of global fans? Do they deserve weekly appearances? They deserve a team like Manchester City , they don't?.
Finally; Pep reviews yourself and the players, how to manage the error when winning 1-0, do you need to press too high?, what should we do when being led ???? I see you are running out of ideas.
We're doing quick exam NOW!  Class: 1:39
How can Mendy be still there in the club? Just how? Because pep signed him? Why the local fans don't protest against Mendy?

I wonder what was gonna happen to Manchester united if they were given those penalties 🤪🤪🤪🤪

Defender must keep focus on the ball don't always lose the ball and where is Aguero long time no see I miss him really

I wonder how angry Pep was in the locker room after the game
Why change Fernandinho?

Man City defenders played like real amateurs, especially Walker & Mendy... how do u give away such penalties when you're pros?

Have the Manchester police located the sniper in the stadium?

Why the defender keep pulling leicester player? there are other options for tackling right?
Could this be like 2016 for Leicester City?
Penalty???
Why Cech is playing in defence?
Hey who stole chek’s cap? 😡😡
Why is no one talking about the three penalties what do you think are they all correct decisions
Maybe you could have bribed the ref real quick!?
Want to know Sterling's statistics ???? was it very influential for the team for last night's match ?? somehow with coach Pep always entered the starting line up ....
Wow, am I the only one who hated the commentary? The Maddison goal was such a beauty and he didn't the commentator couldn't care less?? Bias

Maybe the era of Guardiola at Man City is over....
Why does Mahrez always celebrate against Leicester ? I remember he did the same even on his first match against them ? was there some beef  ? or he is just an asshat ?
Does mendy plays football seriously. I feel we are like 7 men when he is on the pitch.
cmon ederson you're not that bad make 1 save at least...am I the only one noticed that ederson is very bad lately?
Isn’t 4-2 considered a win in pk shootouts? How’d they get 5?
Why is ederson still here.
can we do something with our possession, we need a reliable defender and more experienced forwards
3 penalties ?? what is going on in this defence
3 penalties ... at least 2 looked pure BS... but what the heck is wrong with our ATTACK!!!
