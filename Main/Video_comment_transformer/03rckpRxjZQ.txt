Why don’t you guys get buy land and build a house suitable for everybody in Texas? Land is far cheaper right outside the major cities, you guys can also tailor the house for your needs most houses are the market are designed with a growing family in mind not content creators you guys could build perfect rooms for each member and save on the costs for things you don’t need like a kitchen and you guys would be within driving distance of tons of activities for content creation.
