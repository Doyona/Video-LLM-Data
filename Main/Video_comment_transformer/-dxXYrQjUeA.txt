Whats wrong with having two women men suppose to have other women africans and Muslims have 7 women in africa
Came to see in 2024 if they acted out the restaurant scene yet 😢 #dope video and song 💪🏽💪🏽🌹
Same girl❤by r Kelly and Usher??😊
Huh?? Wtf? How am I just hearing this? Youtube suggests every damn thing else, im hotttttttt.
I was wondering if the video would have a same girl twins twist lol. Guess not tho.
How did I discover this only now? This is giving me vibes Brandy and Monica ,, love ittt 👀💅🏽✨🤍
Which is which?
Does this song give off Same Girl vibes to anyone else? I can’t listen to this without thinking they got inspiration from Same Girl 😂
Wait cause whyyyyy Queen look so good . She slaying 😍
your not a Nigerian why queen naija I don't understand ? who you representing
Love it!!! The only thing I dislike is why didn't yall show the set up
Anybody notice they playfully talking about calling the guy out in the song, but end up kidnapping him in the video?  That escalated quickly.
Who else done this before? 😘😜
Ari where is your invisible cigarette lol
Any one know who the dude is ?
is it me or this is giving ( same guy )that song from jamaica.............is it me orrrr
Hey love can you do young blu remix your mines still?
I don't get how this Queen NAIJA song is said to be related to "SAME GIRL" by R .Kelly and Usher.
What happened to war cry? What happened?! You were right... we must see the Blood of Jesus. Even if you didn’t write the son but just sang it, you do this? I’m not judging you. I’m just not understanding. God bless you and I will pray for you
Didnt Usher and Kelly do this already? And also Monica and Brandy?
anybody getting this "rkelly ft. usher - same girl" vibes here?
Who the guy playing the cheater?
Ari’s waste... where is it??
Who is the actor in the video?
Wth this shit is ass where is the rest of the video
So cute, but y’all couldn’t straighten my girl Ari’s glasses? Lol
ay how tf do you make a beat thats 77.5 BPM??? bruh
Looks like DMX ex wife Tashera and DMX fiance in this video ..Hmm?
Is this Lucas from backchat London?
Why am I seeing up  Ari Lennox nostrils so much in this video 👀
Can they just become a permanently duo
Wait R Kelly & Usher sound different 🥴☠️
Um. Is anyone going to tell them that they spelt “THE REALIST” incorrect?
omg who is this fine man lol
How the hell is youtube allowing such depravity on its platform? Jesus Christ
Both of them look a bit funny to me? Not exactly ugly, but really funny. 😂
Was I the only one that wanted to see her bring his plate?🤔
Y y’all didn’t act out the scene w her bring in the plate, the look up on his face girl I was waiting for that scene!!??!!
Queen looks like she lost a lot of weight in her face or is it just me
Who is going to watch the "Same girl" video now?
So are we going to get chapter 2?
does no one see how much the music video copies kash dolls- for everybody like come now??
Who said what when where and why yessss ladies
Who is that guy?
I wonder who's man that really is
Who still here from the first night🥰😫🧏🏾‍♀️
Is this the 2021 version of the boy 👦 is mine?
I like it a lot but can artist nowadays deliver a song without being so explicit?🤔 I think “same girl” and many classics are that because it’s not explicit. I think it’s very easy to write a song about sex and catch peoples attention.
R&B dead...where at?!
Now where's the second part like locked in the closet R.Kelly kinda thing.
Why set him up when y’all gonna still be in his bed 😂😂🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
Can someone tell me what time queen comes in so I can skip it.I'm only here for Ari.Not for a colorist bi#$h
Who was waiting for the guys twin? If you know you know
I need to know what happened we need a part 2
Are we okay with our black males being referred to as niggas?
For how long can I keep a ceiling fan on without damaging it by overheating? Does keeping it on on lower speeds heat it more quickly?
I thought she wasn’t doing music this year?
Is the collab with shengyeng coming?
who is this
When was the last time you thought about mowing the lawn?
Tf w/ dis BS?
😭😭😭please tell me they are working on a part two...? 😍😭😭
Can Teyana Taylor direct the video for part two🥴
Please tell me there is an alternate video I would love to see the actual set up scene
Usher and Rkelly same girl remix? Lol
This should be over a milli by now what is going on
Anynody know how can I like this twice or maybe better like a thousand times? 😆
Why she sound like Jhene Aiko, but worse
what language is this in??
Where’s the theeesome at?
Why does Queen seem more timid in this than normal😭 like she was supposed to give what it was supposed to gaaaave
Ok Ok .. This Song Was Cute, Props Given When Due .. But Queen You Still Not Out The Clear.
So....same girl rip off???
is it just me or does the guy have no nipples
Who else wanted to see the set up scene?
Please tell me there’s a Part 2 coming 😩🤞🏾
How was your day today How to make your time valuable ❤ you,
The U.S. will over issue 5 trillion U.S. dollars in 2020! In the first quarter of 2021, the U.S. issued another $1.9 trillion in over-issued currencies just first season ! Are these over-issued currencies interest-free?
The exact same beat as boo'd up. When will R&B artists stop regurgitating the same style and keynotes looking for a hit??? And trying to sound nostalgic is getting played out now imo, very 2013.
So this ain't the 2021 version of Same Girl?
What happened to everybody saying Ari won’t doing a video with her no more cause of backlash? Guess yall need to 🤐... 😂😂❤️
Why did 3 vids drop today? 🤔 Megan the stallion & durk- movie, Chris brown-go crazy remix and this song it just seems sus lol
Who’s here before the song goes viral 🙋🏽‍♀️
Am I the only one who was looking forward to a scene of them ACTUALLY setting him up at his favorite restaurant 😩
Initially i didn't like the song but I stayed cuz I wanted to know what the tea was 😂
Why do I feel like there needs to be a part II?
Was I the only one waiting to see them fix that dinner and serve him 🤣🤣🤣🤣 sheeesh!
Am I the only one having the "SAME GUY by SHANEIL MUIR, DENYQUE" feeling  These two songs are so similiar
Is this the same girl ladies edition.
Why does this remind me of R kelly and Usher song: Same Girl
Does queen come with her own ideas or does she always got somebodys song or video theme etc.. Like nothing original nowadays
Who produced the track? It got that Masego vibe.
Does this remind y’all of “same girl” or is that just me😭
Okay but can we talk about their outfits😍🥰
Is this same girl  remix 💕💕
Can you guys do it again but actually act everything out in the song according to the story line like a movie please !!
uhhhhh ain't this female version of same girl
Why do women keep holding Queen's mistake over her head? What exactly do y'all want her to do after apologizing? Haters stay bitter because it makes their own demons feel comfortable.
Great song but why didn't they match up their vocals to their mouth correctly. 😒 other than that I love the song. Their vocals amazing. 😍
wasnt queen just bashing darkskins why is she rubbing on one ?
Wht is this, a variation of Usher and R.Kelly's "Same Girl"?🔥🔥
Damn why they ain’t set him up?? I need to be a director cuz my vision for this video was not this. Still a nice video though
Am I the only one who knows the words already 🤣🤣 LOVE ME SOME QUEEN; CONGRATULATIONS LADIES YA HITTING 1M before this year over
So when are we getting the Ari version.
was i the only one waiting for them to act this out? really wanted to see me them SET HIS ASS UP
Not Queen with a man tied up in the bed again. 😂😂 What do her and Clare be on?😭
Is that Cash Mooney from Grownish 👀 he always playin. I see he ain’t learned yet
Is it just me that think this song is so similar to the jamaican song "same guy" by sheneil Muir and deneque.
Why do i feel like people are gonna make this a back and forth texting challenge on tik tok... 😭  😭
