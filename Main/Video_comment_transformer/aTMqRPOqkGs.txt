Netflix is remaking Life of Brian?

I don’t get whats blasphemous about this movie? It’s not slandering Jesus and its painting the main character as a fraud for trying to profit off Jesus.
Can we create some black horror films, fantasy films, fairytale.. animation movies maybe?… but I’m still open to watching this,  maybe it will open my eyes to some things.
Are u mad at the so called "blasphemy" or mad that the cast is 99% blk ? Either way, im just happy u mad 😂

Just to clarify, he isn’t portraying “Jesus” so what is the blasphemous part?
How come I’ve never seen people like you come at Mel brook’s movies? 🤔 the movie that you are so bent out of shape about is not mocking God. It’s having fun from the stories in the book. We don’t worship books. We use them as guides. Stop it & relax.
Can someone explain how this is blasphemy? Because the characters are black? Or because it’s comedic?

Is this should be funny or ? Comedy movie ? Black US culture is so weird.
Umm isn't the erasure of a whole ethnic group (Jews) from their own homeland and history kind of Racist?   Bloody hells Americans, Hollywood and cultural imperialism... 😅
Y'all didn't learn anything from Cleopatra, eh?
What the F am i looking at ???

You know that when Family Guy did this it was meant as a joke, right? Not a script
Anyone got the dislike count on here?
I can't tell what this movie is rated.
Why is Lakeith the only person speaking in a modern accent? Pathetic and lazy writing choice
Is this supposed to be some funny ting? Cause the God I serve ain’t no sleeper😢
Why didn’t you name it “The Book of Simon the Magi”? Bc this blasphemous character actually existed already.

What's the actual point of this movie?
Must y'all do everything for money?
I think it's a comedy so why so many people being so serious about this movie
Did y’all complain this much when ‘Year One’ came out? Don’t remember such an uproar back then..
Wait....jesus is Black?
what in the twisted heaven or hell ?! ...it's a no for me...
Jesus is not white…..but y’all have a problem with this? Maybe the message in the movie is repentenance. He becomes a true Christian??

Bennedict Cumberbatch? I think he'll be Jesus
Why keep making fun of something that's not real ...........................................................Righ!??!?

What in the heck was that?  I won’t be watching that mess!
Apart from blasphemy, why is it that all people of African decent sounds like wakanda...? Next time you want to make an African sound, come to a specific region in Africa that you want a sound to adapt to. Simple
Why the hell os everyone saying this is blasphemy no one can make a biblical comedy that doesn’t paint Christianity in a bad light and still people would say it’s blasphemy
How is this blasphemous 🤔 they are not mocking God they are just trying to tell a story based on the era Jesus lived in. And the guys in the movie are con artists so technically speaking people like that might have existed in the past trying to be like Jesus. I can't call this movie blasphemous just by the trailer alone because nothing shows it is.
What in the ...just....what?????
Maybe I’m confused, but why are people mad? isn’t the story showing how Clarence uses Jesus name for self gain and  not that Jesus is a fraud.
Is that Prince in the background??
Why christianity being mocked is so normalized and when you try to mock islam you are islamophobic and racist?
Are we racist for seeing this or racist for not seeing this? Or just racist because we're right?🤷‍♂️
Wtf is this 😂 something ain’t right it very weird
So... why? Lol...
Mane hell nah what type off bullshit is this mane, yall tweakin who made this ahit
Is it a spoof?
What is this mockery??!
I'm confused. Its it a comedy? A parody? I don't understand... why the slapstick tone. 🤔
Please someone tell me the movie takes a turn towards the end and he changes or this has some kind of metaphorical meaning like he's representing false teachers or sth cause wtf is this😢
Which part is Blasphemous in detail? The main character finds the real God even tho he starts as fraud. The Israelites after hundreds of years are being shown in their true form. Paul was KILLING Christians before converting. Which part of this specifically is problematic?
This is suppose to be a comedy? Looks bad.......
Why are they black?
Damn may God have mercy on his soul Or not. 🤔
I just wanna know why? The motive? The reason? The purpose? The “message” they wanna give out with this crap of a film? Because I don’t understand.
The blanton morchry is ridiculous... & to put Princes music for what? This did nothing...
is this like that netflix cleopatra show but in some type of comedy form ? if yes it doesn't loo very funny...
Astaghfirullah what is this 🤦🏻‍♂️
Why? 🤦🏾‍♀️ God is not mocked.
A black version of Life of Brian?
All the ways the film could have went, and y’all decided to go this way?
Are we Blackwashing west Asians now!  I thought whitewashing Jesus was such an Issue but here we are!
Wtf is this?
How much did they pay for the Prince Song?.
Is this a joke?
Book of Clarence? 😂
So either this is "black-washing" or it's intended to be an alternate reality in which jews and peoples of the near/middle east were black?   Either way, I guess two wrongs make a right as long as you're on the "right side of history." *Sigh...
It’s been awhile since I’ve seen it but is this very close to Life of Brian?
If they believe the bible characters were black then how the hell do you go from the 12 disciples successfully spreading the word of God throughout the world to becoming slaves from 1AD 20th century? It was the whites who continued to spread christianity for as early as 1AD, and through that faith built the modern civilization, but somehow black wants to take credit? Im not even white but thats a fkin reach.
Did the people calling this blasphemous actually watch the same trailer?
Who can deliver you from the judgement of God? We all will have to stand before a Holy God with piercing eyes that knows our heart!
Isn’t this like cultural appropriation using sub Saharan Bantus to play semites.
Ask yourself this question why are they always mocking Christianity?   We are definitely living in the end times WAKE UP DON'T SUPPORT THIS MOVIE
Wtf is this 🗑?
What in the blasphemous!

What is this, a comedy? Felt like I was watching just that.

Does he turn water into Hennessy?
What are all these n doing here?
Bruh wtf is this???
Why you don’t do this in Muslim culture like act black Mohamed and shit
This is a joke, yeah?
Is this Atlanta a few thousand years ago?
There’s definitely a space for a movie like this, about copycats and false prophets during and after Jesus’ ministry. Just not sure this is it. Read that religion is “a backdrop” and if that’s true the setting was a poor choice
Why are they all black???? lmfao
@sicarii wtf is this???
What is this bullshit ?
What in  Black-Hebrew-Israelites is this? Looks like a good fictional film 😊😊😊😊
Why does homie have a blunt in his mouth 2:03 into the trailer 😅?
Is this a comedy? 🤨
Why is it ok to swap black people in over middle eastern people?
I don't understand what this is trying to tell me. It's a movie, yeah, but is it a parody or a retranslation?
It looks like it shaped around when Simon in the Bible asked after seeing the apostles power could he buy the anointing
Wtf is this 😅😅
I am confused :D But I need to see it :D
Why do Americans keep rewriting history? Do Arabs no exist?
Do haircuts like that existed back then?
I wonder how the FAR FAR FAR OVERT RELIGIOUS RIGHT will view this movie if at all 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I only got one question where is Benedict cumberbatch character
So is this a comedy?
Interesting... definitely a great cast....but I hope they don't go too far with this story, Surrounded by the times of Jesus, they have a fine line to walk before going too far. It is good to see a film with this cast and budget being made around this time frame.
It's a good cast... but why is every evil or character with evil intentions mostly white...? 🤔
Where are the Jewish characters
Who is playing Jesus? they got the color right this time 😅
Wow so mock Christianity ..please tell me this is some sort of parody and not to be taken serious....and wtf Prince music ....I'm sorry this looks numb
Is this a parody , ? Looks like a joke
Can someone tell me why is Tristar pictures bylineless
This is a joke right? Like a spoof movie
What is this nonsense???
Is this is a hip-hop version of Bible?
Why be so disrespectful
Is it full of racist white people?
And this is only the teaser 🤩
