I was literally so confused when she only had put white paint on 🤣 I knew Mariah would have to put colour on
when she painted the confetti white,  I was like who are you and what have you done with Moriah
Moriah, you should make your own kit for kids like a squishy decorating one?
How did I miss this??
Hmm have I seen that dress before in a suuuuper old video? Or is that a different one? The video is girls troubles: getting ready. about 7 years ago

Question... how many subs does this channel have?    😗 👉👈
Is this channel actually from youtube
Why do I feel like this would take the same immense amount of pressure and hard work to make this small video as a normal video? Or is it just me
When she started in white I was like whaaaaaaa????
Where did you found this video this is not available on her channel
Why was this video so short? Does anyone know how painful it is to wait a FULL WEEK to watch another video? Moriah is the only person that keeps me through the week. 😭😭😣😣😩😩
can you use longer videos please im not trying to be rude at all srry to bother
Why do I feel like I remember that dress from like a video 6 or 7 years ago...   I think it’s from the video “girl troubles getting ready” on her channel time stamp on that video one minute 40 seconds if you want to judge.
Moriah: we all know the little black dress- Me: *Little black dress by 1D???*
Where did you get this vidio from because like she didn't post this on her channel
Who was a fan of her before she was famous?
WHEN SHE PUT THE BARK SOUND IN MY PUPPY JUST LOOKED OVER AND WAS LIKE 👁👄👁 what was that

I'm confused. She didn't post this so who's is this and how did they get it 🤔
Wait is this replacing her vacation cause normally she posts every Friday except for yesterday cause she said she’s doing winter break
Hi ??? Did you not do it on your youtub channel
Anyone think that the thumbnail doesn't rly look like her? 😂
Why isn’t this video at least 10 minutes?????
Who is this youtuber "Youtube originals?" 'cause your channel name is "Moriah Elizabeth" 😐😐 I'm suspicious
The color in the video is SUPER VIVID. Anyone else notice that? Just me?
I take issue with the fact that, dispite Confetti being the Sprinkles of Decoration, no Sprinkle Song was featured in this clip
