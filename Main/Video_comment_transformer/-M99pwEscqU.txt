What are those things that you stuck to the desk to hold the cables down? I would love some of them, currently using tape lmfao

Dope video. Can you tell Toby that his speakers should be angled towards his ears for optimal sound? There are some cheap angled foam pads that would do that for him. Sick setup otherwise
I was expecting monitor arms to be installed would clear up a lot of room on the desk. You could installed 3 poles on the back of the desk which would keep the same monitor design but would remove the pesky stands.
That couch looks familiar??
