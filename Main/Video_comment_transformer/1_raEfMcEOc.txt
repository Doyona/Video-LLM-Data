So much better now, being picky because the defence was patchy. Not sure what question Cooper is the answer to and was he not given the captains band.
Why only 1 point of view? No cameras on the stadium? The replay is always from the very same POV :(
The third goal was yet another reward for the relentless press of Leeds United. Is there a running tally for goals scored after winning the ball deep in the attacking third? It seems like the Leeds lads are doing it at least once per game this season. The whole squad is bought in to the Marschball philosophy, and so far so good.
Was this available to watch live anywhere?
Can you stop putting the line up in numerical order? Confusing as fuck man😂
For Klich second goal was that a cheeky back heel pass to him from Summerville?
Three goal contributions from Sinisterra - looks like he should start ahead of James on current form. But between him and Harrison, both prefering the left side, how will they set up?
What song is that being  played at full time it’s been bugging me for weeks😂
If they had Cameras, why didn’t LUTV stream it?
Man how does Barnsley score more points than Chelsea
