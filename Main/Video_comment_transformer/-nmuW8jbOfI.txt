how rich could chunkz be the way darkest and johnny are talking about him? 10:42
What in the world was this episode 😭🥀
Whis here after the alligations 😭💀
I feel like Harry felt pissed off at the first question
Why is Harry so mean to AJ!?
Harry is dumb af here, the question is “who is the strongest” Johnny says he’s the strongest because he’s literally strong and goes to the gym. But Harry is like “yeah but I box”?? Like that’s not the question
Violating filly for what😭😭😭
The questions need to be similar so it isn’t so obvious
Does Harry have beef with Aj? He’s always soooo mean to him
The whose your celebrity crush question was crazy 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The faker should get the same question...
Why do they say the question straight away that makes it easier for the faker
man am i the only one who searched Delia smith to find out she real and has net worth of 36million $$ emm
Is harry part of jd now as well
So does the question on the fakers computer turn to the legit question on the reveal so it’s easier to defend ?
The questions could have been similar in some way. So the faker wouldn’t be that apparent. 🫶 Thanks for the laughs, sirs.
mmmmm footasylum should've changed the question format iclll. faker should've been given a question which would result in a similar answer to the other boys.
Kinda new here.. are AJ’s teeth fake?
Asked pronounced Acksks" is hilarious
That Filly Question killed me
Question one word Darkest: see u on Tuesday
Man am i the only one that thinks AJ looks like Sy in active gxng
When will you Guys make another new video, with Nella 🥺
