Have figured out where the draft is coming from?
just one question, what does he do with all the dirt and shit
I wonder what advice 2025 Colin would give to 2020 Colin on digging this tunnel.
What if you encounter water, watercourses? How do you deal with it?
But where did the draft come from?
Do you need planning permission for something like this? What happens when you want to sell the house?
I’ve always wondered about how his neighbors deal with all the noise😅
Wait if it's a SECRET tunnel than why would you make a video on it? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of it all? Cause it's a secret tunnel and now over thousands of people know about it
wait so where did that draft lead to?
Be honest... how much did the trumpets help
I'd be interested to know what he ***really*** did with the excavated material... or is that information too sensitive?
Is every one just gonna ignore the fact he left dirt in stores and cafes?
how many yards of material have you removed with the tunnel from shed to pantry part? i hope your utube is helping pay for all that steel and concrete - AMAZING
Don't you ever need a lumbar belt brace?
What’s the movie scene he put in??
5:02 - 7:34 Is there an actual name for this kind of tool, or did Colin just invent a new form of excavating equipment with this project?
I was wondering why my box of coco pops was full of dirt.
WHAT ABOUT THE CRACK????!!!!!
kid: "mom why is our cereal so crunchy?"
What's the song that starts at 6.24
I know this is old and probably late but ehy didn't you get a 24" auger bit and drill out 4feet at a time? Then square it out?
Wait but for real where does the dirt go lol
Hope that draft isn’t a gas line
How did this guy actually do this rhing while doing other projects
Would be so cool to know two things... How many full days of work are spent digging so far, and how much money spent?
Is this legal
I just found you today. I look forward to watching. What could be more exciting than watching a guy dig a hole?! One Q, that I'll probably get an answer to along the line, but will still ask. How did you decide on the depth?
I wonder if would be a piece of cake to you, doing a SHOCKER SOFA, like the old electric chair arcade game... Sometimes I have some lack of energy  getting out of the couch.. I think that would do the trick!....
Using regular carbon steel what is the estimate before rust becomes a concern?
Picking up and carrying buckets? ....I spent most of the video wondering why he didn't just use a wheelbarrow.
do you know how to play trombone colin, as it seems like you mostly have a good idea of how to play
Where are those plastic tubs from?? They look wicked strong
How does one get a permit to dig a hole under the house and shed, and such?
Dude, what do you do for a living that you have so much free time? I also want.
Colin what did you study to learn all this?
i have to ask what would of happend if the crack did lead into a massive cave XD
Neighbors talking to each other over the fence, Colin has been mighty quiet lately, do you suppose he gave up on that tunnel ? 🤔
Are going towards the garage at some point?
What do you do with the dirt
Surely you had to get planning permission for this!? Amazing job.
I don’t get it why would a project like this be delayed because of the pandemic?
Where has all the soil gone?
I'd imagine your neighbours are subscribed to your channel?
i cant even build a tree house in my yard how did he get the pements to do this????
How do your neighbors feel about this
u didnt actually put the cereal box back into the store w dust right????
Have you or can post the plans for how you did this?
What’s the name of the song at 10:50 I’ve heard it a few times but I can’t seem to find it anywhere
I’m really wondering if he truly left containers off dirt everywhere. 🤣😂🤣😂
What is the name of the movie with the sock? And dirt ?
Just wondering weather Colin has a wife something makes me think not 😂
When's your first concert
At 11:20, the metal frames appear to be curved. Are they really curved or is that the camera lens creating that effect?
What happened with the draft? There's probably a river system down there!
How many complaints did he get to make him try so hard to be quiet
Why doesn’t Colin live out in the sticks where he can make as much noise as he likes and build bigger and better things? He must have the money!
So what happened to that “secret cave” from where the air was coming? ( at 9:02 )
But where is all the dirt going?!?
Really though, where is all the landfill going?
How tf do you keep your shirt so clean XD
So why not have put in a stairwell?
What I really want to know is where the heck that cave went
Hi Colin i was just Wondering if you could tell me what Kind of Filming Camera do you have
neighbours  be like "wtf is tht lunatic up too now"
How are you going to water proof it?, Won't your tunnel fill with water?
Anybody else fancy the idea of another Lincolnshire resident, Guy Martin, teaming up with Colin to develop some crazy invention for a death-defying speed challenge??!
One question. Why is one of the tags Minecraft
I wonder how you do this when you're not filthy rich.. 🤔
Why did he not just build a laser to vaporize the dirt and rocks? He could make it.
No one gonna talk about that box of dirt just on the shelf of a grocery store? I wonder what happened to it
do you need a permit for this
How exactly is it a secret tunnel if you're telling everyone about it?
Where does he find this amazing punk for his background music? I could watch these just for the music, but the shenanigans are also glorious.
9:39 don’t you mean you’ve hit rock bottom?
Do you own your property all the way down to the center of earth? And what prevents you from going sideways at some point? It's free real estate!!
Furze.. man you have all the fun lol. Why didn't you build yourself a TBM? - We all know you've got the skills for it.. would be great to see a furze tunnelling machine in action!!!
How do you plan to do laundry and smell amazing down there?
find any fossils?
whats gonna happen to the house when you decide to move out?
What's the music at 12:17? It doesn't seem to match anything on the description.
Big hole straight down. Eh? Oxygen?
We never know this underground bunker could be useful
Why not sound proof the shed? And besides I doubt anyone will hear you down there
I'm new to the channel... Why does it have to be quiet? For the secrecy part?
I wonder if he needs permits to do this, because I’ve don’t stuff like this and we needed a permit
Is this done with council approval!?
What does he do with all the spoil??
What happened to the hydraulic pump that was don’t there before?
Please tell me you aren't planning on leaving that moldy carpet in there the whole time..
How does your nabors hear a shovel.
i dont get why he couldn't make a noise
Wait how do you get...out of it?
Where did the air come from?
is this project old? it appears to have been completed for over a year. --> https://youtu.be/fqTDfpIpub4?t=36 (winch and screw in the mat)
Couldn't he fit a small digger in there ?
I wonder if he'll ever sell that house...
if you did it yourself, do you have bulging muscles now?
It can't just be me that thought spades and shovels were the same thing?
So what did you really do with the earth you removed?
Why didn't you just use a big skrew? Like a auger and place buckets at the top where the dirt would fall and just carry them away?
did you ever explore, e.g. by using a sewer camera, where that gap leads to?
Instead of customizing your shovel, which was probably fun, you could have gotten a military folding shovel. Just a thought
My capitol is at risk? Who’s attacking it?
Who else buying his house when he's gone
What kind of permits do you have to pull in the UK in order to do something like this?!?
Is it secret cos its fun or are the neighbours complaining
Not sure why the semi-formal clothing was necessary for the band practice deception. It's band practice, not a band performance.
Where is the scene at 1:25 originally from? It appears to be a movie I've never heard of.
Curious, do you need planning for an underground tunnel in your garden? Asking for a friend 🙈
You will need water pumps with a tunnel. Is it not simpler to make a big trench first?
Bit late now, but maybe a mini digger could've been used to do the initial digs? lol
Question. Is this illegal? I imagine it is haha
Why i am getting money heist vibes??
Where your real bunker
When the teacher asks the kids “What do you want to do when you leave school?” I wonder what Colin said?
Is that crack in the slab starting at the corner of the hole a concern?
Hey, meld plate or metal sheet is a waterproof?
Do you need permits for this kind of thing?
You should check out ask Jeff Williams he's got a tunnel that you dream about
@Collinfurze did you ever play Minecraft..?? >>you never dig straight down you dingle berry.<<   LOL great stuff been watching for years since the early builds.
We are wondering what are you going to do with all the dirt.   Because digging a tunnel,  creates a tremendous amount of dirt, rock, etc.
Out of interest, did you need to get planning permission to do any of this?
Can you imagine the estate agent listing when he eventually sells his house.
Tom was on wheeler dealers wasn't he?
What happened about the crack Colin?
Are we there yet? 😂
Was that fella helping Colin in that program where he got a delorean?
I haven't seen all episodes of this project yet, but... Is there a moment where you go down the tunnel hanging on the hoist mimicking famous "Terminator-2" episode? :)
What happened to the HYD pump that was built in before? Or was it not strong enough? I swear you had one already for you press and testing new toys.
Imagine if that crack turned out to be a tunnel under your house that one of your neighbours had started digging?
It's weird you even have neighbors. Why didn't you get a house on some land a long time ago before making all these bad ass improvements?
I don't understand why you had to stop digging on your own property, because of covid lockdown??
Cant tell what's more insane, this project or him digging in a white shirt.
No update on the crack?
Colin. Can it be that youre seeing something we dont see?
whats the name of the background music in the lockdown scene at the end?
Next project batcave?
I still wonder how his neighbors haven't moved out yet
Could you build your own rail gun for are type 45 destroyers as it the future for the weapons system on the UK ships because BAE Systems can't get it to work because it over heats within just 2 or 3 shots.
Who else is wondering how ripped he must be to do this!!!
Is it me or was Tom starting to play when the saints go marching in on that trumpet
What about a home made hydraulic  tunnel boring machine ?
Did we ever find out what the cave was connected to?
What kinda permits or papers do you need to do this?
I ask again is this legal
i wonder how much his house is gonna eventually sell for
Do you need planning permission for this? Lol. In Cornwall we have tunnels preinstalled.. unfortunately sometimes they eat your patio.
What's the music at 12:16? Doesn't appear to be listed
What happend to the air flow hole? Show more where it is now?
What was the name of the movie clip about filling the bags I have been trying to find that movie for years and I cannot find the name of it for the life of me
What all your neighbours went away on the same day, lol?
What's the name of the music that begins 12:15?
could the air coming from the ground be a ruptured/broken natural gas line? I'm not sure about the UK, but here in Australia, we get our gas in pipes from the government that travel underground, similar to sewage and water.
i wonder how you can safe kid inside of you through so much years)) now I only 26, but if I will start digging secret tunnel in my backyard my parents will kill me (but its my kid dream to make SECRET TUNNEL!) MAN PLEASE DO NOT GROW UP!!!!!!!!!!!)))))))))))))
Is there any age restrictions on the free trade app cause I’m seventeen
so he never really says what he does with the dirt? i watched ep 3 then ep 1, then this just to find out where he put all the dirt. slightly disappointed. still a good video.
Can't you hire one of them massive hoover machines they can excavate with?
Question: why did he order full sized shovels and cut them down instead of just buying shorter shovels? Answer: because it was a damn good excuse to break out the welding torch and that's quite fun
But where did the draft come from?
Wouldn’t one of the screws from your tank build work to get dirt out, like a massive drill?
2:32 what song is this?
I wonder if Colin fancies streaming the dig? Just have a camera on while he's digging, doesn't have to present to it the whole time. Just watch him sweat and probably swear a bit. Incidentally for a rocket-bike pilot it's admirable how well he gets swearing under control. Pledge a dollar every time he needs to pull his pants up to cover his bum crack.
Secret Tunnels - Pros: Covers floor with lino, hiding entrance from casual observer. Cons: Documents entire thing on Youtube.  Hmmm. Maybe security needs reviewing.
The neighbours in reality: Colins not made any noise in his shed all week, do you think he's alright? Theres normally power tools 24/7
Why didnt you just soundproof the hole?
I have a serious question i have watched you videoes for years but what the hell do u not have neighbours or something???
wheres the next vid it should be uploaded????
Hey @colinfurze I’ve been working on a drift trike build and I can’t thank you enough for what you did to help everyone to build a drift trike. I was just wondering what did the frame look like without anything on it, or do you have a blueprint?
Wonder how many time he broke or pass out while doing this...
So how far are you away from the bank?
Is that construction legal in your country?
Trying to figure out how the backyard swing plays into this build? I know Colin has a plan.
Where are the guns, explosives and drugs?
What kind of music is playing at the end of the video (12:16)?
How can he just dig without the fear of breaking any pipelines or pre-existing structure?
Just wondering have you ever invented anything that is actually unique end of youth to the general public
Issues with neighbours?
Why you didn't made tatoos with a blueprint?  El Chapo needs you for escaping now...a team of German Mining Engineers is too expensive for him
Hey Colin,  Fantastic project. Can't wait to see how it progresses.  What music is that playing at about 12:15 when you start the March 2020 "Lockdown" montage?  It doesn't seem to be any you have listed (unless I missed it), and I can't find it on Shazam.  Can't get enough of it and what a perfect thing to play for that part of it.  Love it!
Is there anything this guy can't do? 🤣
how have I never heard of this channel with 11.1 million subscribers
1.7k people why?
How often are you going to post these!?
Why is it tagged minecraft
can a building/mining engineers confirm the "studs" used to hold the bracing? minimal contact point to all the lime seems counter productive
What's the song name at 12:20 ? It's not in the description...
I wonder how much the colorful plastic dirt-holder weighs when full...
Out of curiosity, is this legal? It's super fun to watch the process, but it sure seems like something you could get in trouble for doing.
Why couldn't you just use the soil drill to take bulk out?
well aint that like minecraft in real life?
I wonder if his neighbours check out his channel whenever they think he's up to something.
So how long until he's under the German line?
wait no one can hear you down in your bunker?
When he sells the house the buyers are going to have a whole lot of questions haha
how do you get planning permission for all this? Tunnels, bunkers etc? Would really like to know...
What about fluds?
Soooo.... why no wheelbarrow? And _why_ would you not wear ear protection?! Not even when using an actual jackhammer!
When will the next video come out? Can wait anymore😂
Are you preparing for the WW3? 😂
So you are all about inventing things.  Why are you manualy rolling back the carpet and lifting the door? Auto carpet roller and door opener please.
Could ask el chapo to help you
How's that a secret tunnel if the map is clearly available publicly on YouTube?...…..Hope Dark Wizards don't watch this video!  Other than that, Gj Furze!
all i want to know is what is down that hole!!!  plz tell us
Why did I get minecraft flashbacks and cringe at digging straight down lol
why not use an auger to do lots of this ground work.
Are their any legal issues associated with digging yourself a hole like that in the UK? Like any special permits that are needed or anything?
Hi Colin, what's the name of the background track used at the end of the video?
But what happened to the crack
do u normaly shit with both lids up?🤔🤣
Got any bank near?😎
How are you going to keep Dee Dee out? Also surprised your not using an auger bit with a hydraulic drill or a rotary hammer when neighbors are out.
So what's the legalities of land ownership and what you actually own? Do you legally own only the surface or to a particular depth or all of it to a diminishing point at the core of the Earth?
The hell is the mayor of Albuquerque doing after work every day? Shouldn't he change first?
I wonder if he can fabricate a makeshift micro-TBM (Tunnel boring machine) for the next part...
Why not just buy a post hole shovel?
what about the draft, where was it coming from?
Have you not heard of a wheelbarrow ? Or a entrenching tool (small pointy spade)
Why didn’t you keep doing it during covid?
What are the details on your plasma cutting table ?!  Looks to be a perfect size for a lot of small shops.  Self-built ?!  Purchased ?!  If so, Where ?!  Price range ?!
How is it that Colin hasn't been knighted yet?
Did anyone else recognize the sign change in the danish shop?
did he really put dirt in a store
Have you though about using sound proof Materials in the shed to allow for small sds drills to be used?
How legal is this?
Any guesses as to how tall the tunnel will be?  Will it be walk through or crawl through?
So is it gonna be 1 year 3 months for part 2?
colin, why is your tiolet seat all up? or is this a secret invention of your own?
Hey Colinfurze, quick idea for you, maybe building a conveyer belt leading out of the shed would help with dirt disposal to save multiple trips out of the shed, what do you think?
Neighbors: what's your exercise routine? Furze:
Can you make an automated cheese toasty machine?
6:45 Anyone is here who know what machine is it ? I think that it will be plazma cutter or laser but I am not sure. Could you help me?
but uhhh where does that crack go?
how about a little quiet, unobtrusive fracking?
But where did you actually put all of the rock and dirt? im genuinely curious haha
@colinfurze can me and a friend come help you dig Terry the tunnel
My wife wants to know where your canary is?
Love what your doing Colin but what would happen if you ever sold your house and moved  ??
Who else is like I’ve been watching him for two years and he hasn’t bought a new camera
question, if you had to buy a mig welder home use what type, parweld, lincoln, gys ?? and synergic or transformer type?? cheers
Question, why not make a boring drill like the boring company? Mount a Electric motor with a plate and flat bar welded to the plate at a digging angle with a sharp edge
How secret is it ? did you not have to apply for planning permission ?
Where did the hole with the air go?
No massive auger bit that drills a cylindrical hole and draws the spoil up to the surface and a skip?
This makes me wonder how deep you're actually allowed to dig before it isn't your property anymore. Could you technically just dig down to the core of the Earth and that would still be considered your property?
Where does the crack goes to?
Is this a job application for digging tunnels under a certain wall ? silently :-) Love this craziness. I was dreading a cave in ...and right when i was planning on commenting - there go the side"walls"... In my area you would get so much water sepage that a mesh wouldnt do anthing :-(
Question about the nice music that starts around 12:17 (March 2020). What/who is it? Could you update the Music section of description?  thank you so much
But Colin! How can it be a "secret" tunnel when it's all over youtube?! :D
secret to who?
How does this guy get planning permission for all this mad shit?
I wonder which episode will show him building the missile silo?
Mhhmm is this illegal ???
How have I manage to avoid this channel for years??? I can't believe I'm only discovering this gold mine now...
How exactly is it secret tho ?
Colin Farts?
What is the outcome of that "crack"? And where is the air coming from?
What about electric and sewer pipes or worst an unexpected natural cave???
By how much have these projects increased the value of your house??
What's the point calling tunnel a "secret" while you show it on yt :D
what about Radon gas?
alternative  soundtrack for this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytWz0qVvBZ0  ps: mb colinfurze is a dwarf?
Okay but did that crack lead to a cave? How are you not more curious?
I need to know if he actually left a cereal box full of dirt and if someone grabbed it 😂😂
What next? Digging a secret bunker with nuclear generator? Making underground food farm? Creating a rocket for traveling to mars? Ok, I'll wait  :D
Random question: do you have to get permits for all this?
Cop come by why are you digging a hole are you trying to rob a bank
does a army helmet stop a grenade exploding.
How do you deal with structural things and whatnot? I would imagine this could affect the foundation around your house, which your insurance company may not love :P have you had a structural engineer out or anything?
But wait… is it just movie magic, or that I live in Texas and it’s always 100°F / 38°C , but how are you doing all this hard labor without even breaking a sweat???
Did you call JULIE? Uh, well I guess there you call DFB.
Are all your neighbours seismologists?
this is my first time here and WHY DO YOU WEAR A TIE WHILE DIGGING
Why not just make an area for wires in the entrance and then just soundproof the top?
with all the stuff that gets done to this house I'm wondering how much  the value of it would have raised/lowered with all the extra stuff underground and such
Anyone else hate their neighbours so much they'd do as loud as possible?😅🤣🤣
4:52 is that how conan brushes his hair
do you skate? I noticed you were wearing an element and a vans shirt in this video.
Where are you going to find enough bed planks?  Colin, this is possibly the most dangerous project you've ever attempted. Please stay safe!
Question when is the next video I hope its longer because I know it will take a long time tho be careful and make the tunnel long and big but better I wish I was there to help you dig that tunnel but sadly I live in the USA but I'm excited to see this tunnel built Be safe! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Is it a secret when you tell everyone about it?
Why in holy fuck is he doing this in a shirt and trousers?
Wait I'm a fan don't get this wrong but 3 years to dig 12 feet down seems like a big stuff around I mean why not just get on with it working from home after all
Couldn’t you just sound proof the tunnel entrance and along with the depth of the tunnel you should cause a disturbance to the surrounding area allowing u to dig faster and more efficiently
Wait, you waited a whole year because you thought neighbors would hear you? You are so far underground now that there is going to be basically zero noise.
Do you usually dig in a tie? :D
how many parts are there going to be?
I wonder how much this house would sell for
How does he get the planning  permission???
I wonder if you have considered making a powered minecart of some sort for transport between points, sort of like a sideways elevator with recall buttons at each entry point
Is this guy married? He's not married, right? He can't be.
Why is ur seat up when ur taking a shit??
I was wondering what he would accidently unearth!
Can you make an electric go kart using basic tools
whats secret
seriously? middle od september?
is there going to be video 3?
When do you think your video will be ready for digging sideways?
When will you come out with part 3?
How deep is the ground water table in your area?
Just started watching you Colin. My go to channel now. Do your neighbours ever complain?😉
So are you going to put a lift in there?
Is your house in an area which can get radon gas? I know areas of Lincolnshire can have it. You need to get the air that's coming from the ground checked or it could cause cancer
I’m curious, what’s the back up plan for flooding? Like say there’s a flood in your street with the UK weather and all, wouldn’t your whole bunker be flooded? Idk how they prevent that in general.
I didn't see the whole thing up to this point but... how did you get a permit for this
Oi, do you have a license for that tunnel?
Have you thought about something like an Archimedes screw to help remove material rather than filling bucket pull bucket up?    Something that you can fabricate, make a video about and all that rot.   Just saw your "underground beach hut" video and that seemed like a perfect use for one.
Is it a secret if 3.1 million people know about it?
How the hell do you get building permits for a secret tunnel?
Secret tunel ? 3 milion people already know about it :D
Is this even legal?? How did you not hit any utility lines
7:30 ... wait, was this the reason for it all this time?????
this is all permitted right?
September? September of... 2019 then?? How hard was it to keep quiet about this project it's so cool!!  I'm still hoping you've run into a cave and get to expand your bunker and secret entrance/tunnel into a cave system :D
Why this man look related to Gordon Ramsay tho 😂
IDK how much you're making off this but you've earned every penny!
are you allowed to do that? or will the county shut you down if they find out?
Is it legal and safe to build under a building?
Why does this video have the Minecraft tag?
What was that tunnel with air, you didn't tell us :(
What if he comes across a random fossil underneath his house?
Hi Colin what is this song at 12:18 ? keep it up, it's great
How is this secret??
Do you need any permits?
A hydraulic bucket wheel won't work sadly due to what appears to be a high clay content but have you thought of a similar system for excavating the face? failing that a hydraulic powered pressure cleaner might be useful for "Hydro excavation" just remember a bilge pump so you don't end up needing a snorkel :)  Side note for the future: Using a pully at the base of the initial shaft could redirect the winch to be able to drag a sled/trolley down the tunnel for ease of waste removal.
the freetrade link doesnt seem to be working.....? is it just me?
Why? just why?
Who Else First Saw Him On Tv
Why not set up some cameras on your front to be able to check from your shed if your neighbours' cars are in their driveways?
Secret tunnel? With a Youtube channel and 3 million views? :D
Well, it's just a tunnel now........ Also, how do you get approval for this? In the US, that bunker alone would have gotten you fines and county/city suits that would bury you financially for the rest of your life.
Have you checked where the sewage  pipes and water pipes are?
when will the next video be up
Who works in a tie???
So was the air coming from the subway tunnel underneath your house?
Why can't you make noise?
Do you have planning permission? Have you notified the HSE? Have you undertaken ground investigation prior to starting? Do you have everything in place to dig the tunnel safely. Incredibly dangerous and you could end up in prison.
Is this the Saddam Hussein bunker project
How could you say it's a secret
Colin... did you forget your Thyroid Medicine? I swear I'm pretty sure I've seen sugar amped toddlers with less energy.
Alright, who let Steve into the real world?
What #minecraft ??
I got a question, You didn't died yet. I know you till i was a kid man .
If you're underground, why how could anyone still hear you? Wouldn't you come off as a giant mole or something?
Where are the Roman coins?
why are you not using a small auger? not only does it dig in by itself it can move the diggings out of the hole.
"What are those two men doing in the shed? And why is the music so loud?"  "Probably filming German porn."
any idea how long until you post the next video for this?
What's the song he's playing during the first few digs
Don't you have to submit plans and get them approved?
Dude, I just want to know what kind of coffee you drink.
Why has this channel never been recomended for me before... I am genuinely upset at YouTube algorithm
Hahaha do you have a permission from site supervision to do that?
So why cant he make too much noise?
Are you high on tea?
...why not just use an auger?
looks like you found a real life batcave of your own???
Is it recorded in My home land, Denmark?
Notch is yoir Friend?!??!
Now I am still curious about where that draft actually came from? And what about that crack?
What’s weird about two men sitting in a shed listening to loud music?
Colin is that a sock filled with dirt in ur trousers or are u just happy to see me hehe
Colin out here building these crazy underground projects... What do you see coming in the future that's causing this?? lol
Where does he get his background music from? Is it free use?
min5:10 wouldnt you do this with the vakuumcleaner I would scip this!
T-shirts?))
Is raining not an issue for flooding? Is the earth nonporous?
Would you really be able to hear anything when you are that far underground? I feel like any power tools would be barely audible by your neighbours.
has anyone noticed yes that with theese videos its not more a secred bunker tunnel
Is this legal??😂😂😎✌🏻
This guy looking for a job with the Mexicans?
how much product can you run through that tunnel?
Hey colin i was wondering, will this be a part of the house once youre no longer here?
Is this legal
I wonder if he needs permits for any of the things he's built or created.
Is this even legal in the UK?
Question, how the ever living hell did you manage to navigate building regs for this?
Will you find the water table?   Will this become an underground swimming pool?
So, how come Colin isn't using a large corkscrew head on a rotating motor? If the noise concerns him, he could just resort to using electric ones underground.
I am getting definite vibes that old Furzie has had some trouble with his neighbours about all the crazy stuff he gets up to in his shed, and especially in his back garden with noise etc. He seems really keen to keep the noise even though it's down a great bloody hole in the ground. How much noise escapes from something like that???
What´s Colin up to these days? A _secret_ tunnel? Not very secret now, is it? _First demerit._  And, where are the traps, the pitfalls, and the tests to determine worthiness? _Second demerit._
IS THIS LEGAL????
Are spade shovels in America are made out of fiberglass or wood. They dont last.
What's the dramatic ending music with the strings?
Do you have like planning permission for this work?
Does this mean I wasn't crazy when I tried to do this at our house, when I was 11?
How about building a small tunnel boring machine?
Is this illegal? lol  I dont wanna rat on you. I'm just wondering if you'd get in trouble if found out.
hey Colin, aren't the neighbours watching youtube?🤔
But....what happened to the crack? Did you find out where it lead, to? :/
Colin how can you be so little prepared for the job? it would have taken you only a small fraction of the time to make it of you had enchanted your tools with efficiency V and set up a haste beacon, smh...
What dweeb digs a hole wearing a tie???????   An idiot, kind of like me for watching 😎😱🤬
How did you get the planning permission to do something like this?
Hey genuine question, do you need to get planning permission before you start any of this stuff?
What the hell is this amazing video i just found
Have you considered... Radio-controlled robotic machinery. Similar to the robotic excavator and bulldozer on YouTube.. yeah make yourself a big bot and quit digging it the hard way.
Your neighbors do watch your videos right??
From who's the sound track that starts 12:18? Very nice composed! Shazam is not able to recognise it :-(
Wouldn’t at some point the oxygen levels get low? The farther you dig?
Man somebody is going to think so hard why this box is so heavy
Surely if the tunnel’s underground like that then nobody should hear like with the bunker right?
What is the song at 12:16 called?
What if you hit a pipe?
when will the next video come out
Secret? With over 2.5 million views not anymore 😂
What about vacuum instead? https://youtu.be/bH4zCn1NEmE
So what's the story about this even being legal in the UK? Did you need planning approval and how are you dealing with building control? I doubt you'd self-certify. Are BC making inspection visits to ensure you're not undermining adjacent structures and incorporating adequate shoring as you excavate? And what are you really doing with the spoil? So many questions. You should really add disclaimers and warning notices to these videos as other people may try and copy you and fall foul of the law.
Why is he so worried about being quiet and doing it when neighbors are gone? Not like anybody is gonna care or actually know what’s going on
What do you mean by maximum depth?
Is the "secret" part of this that there's no planning permission? ahahah
In 100 years, when Colin dies and his family have moved on; this house won't be sold right? We're just gonna turn it either a Museum or some kinda glorious monument to madness?
why didn’t he just put efficiency on his shovel 😕
Colin! Where is your hard hat?
Where do you get the money for this
Idk how secret you can call the bunker if 2.5 million people saw it lol
There are some things you do that make me wonder just how tight you wear your tie.
Why does signing up for FreeTrade app involve needing my national insurance number? Sorry, Colin, my NI number is worth more to me than a possible £1 worth of shares! Not only is capital at risk, identity is also at risk... ...and I've left the FreeTrade app a 1 star Google Store review for the same reason
Getting ready for WW3??
How deep is ground water over there? I can’t get 6 feet without hitting water. 😕
I might have missed it In Part one, but did Colin explain why he needs to be quiet? I know it’s a secret tunnel but just curious
Is that not super dangerous because of lack of bracing even waist high soil if it collapses would break your legs and everything
Colin, have you tried forcing some colored smoke through your vent to see where it comes out?
Wouldn't a hydraulic auger been a lot easier?
You need to dig in silence?  Don't you make all kinds of crazy noises in there already?
I'm curious.... how did he get the permits for all the underground projects lol or did Colin just say Fuck it?
I need to know if he left the cereal box there,cause the bag in the pub I imagine he would gone back for but the box he could’ve left it there for a joke,which I’ve gotta say wouldn’t even been funny if an old woman called Doris went to buy cereal and got VERY CONFUSED 😂😂😂.....love your stuff man been here since the homemade jet engine 👍
i cant help but think you need some sort of permit to do this, how are you making sure everything is legal/safe. dont want this tunnel to cause your shead or house collapse
Turn it into a bat cave man, what happened to that crack?
Is it still a secret if it's on trending?!
What about a screw conveyor?? Dig it, dump it into the trough and up and away it goes!
Is that not illegal?
Still, digging? sad you can't do live streams of the digging
What was the music track during the lockdown news scene?
Why can't I become his apprentice in engineering? Dude, you are  a genius!  You radiate so much positive,I can see that you are trying and enjoy the work done ! I hope that when I meet you, I will shake your hand, you inspire! lovin ya all!))
Can you not make a hydraulic mini boring machine ?  Just a flat disk about 8 inches thick with tungsten teeth ? Maybe just an adjusting rack so you can adjust the depth and field of your holes? It would be 100 percent silent and should work nicely.
Why you using this outfit to dig? 😂😂
How does Collin keep out doing himself!!!!!! Doing great
Does anyone know what's the music at 12:16 ? It's not listed in the description.
I don't want to be *that person* but you do have some engineers looking into like, whether that edge reinforcement is enough, right? Right? https://www.assp.org/news-and-articles/keeping-workers-safe-during-trenching-and-excavation
is a Tunnel "Secret" when you made videos about it ?
He’s gone mad?!
What is the song during the lockdown flashback?
Man I hope we don't have to wait another year for the next video. The year is 2032 and Colinfurze is half way to his bunker the question on everyone's mind, will he make it to the bunker before 2050?
Are you allowed to just dig a tunnel under your house or do you need permits and things like that?
Did Vietnamese watch this video in Vietnam War ?
Wait, you live in Stamford? Just 15 minutes from me. So unexpected... 😄👍🏻
Secret?
How long did this take you😲
can't help but wonder about the planning permission
Do you need planning permission for something like this!?
why is Colin forcing to be so funny all the time?
Sorry, but wouldn't putting the soil in the cereal box and taking to supermarket be illegal?
Do you need any permit for this? And how would you explain it to them 🤣
realistically does this increase property value
surely the very concept of a secret tunnel is that it's secret... not recorded and placed on Youtube.... for over 10,000,000 to know about....? 😅 I love the fact that you are even redefining the definition of words!! love it!!! 👍😁
hay Colin got a question.. have you ever thought about getting a Sea Freight container (short or long 42ft one) and use it for a 2nd shed and decorate the outside. would give you the best fire protection and allot to work in
Colin why don't you knock up a augar  and vertical conveyer system to help dig and lift
How is this legal lol
Still don't understand why you don't get a hole digger (30 cm diameter would be good., then use it to loosen lots of soil at a time...😅 They're not THAT noisy...😅 Or you could even make your own electric one!😁
Is that clay? You could kiln it on the inside of the tunnel to add an extra layer of stability. Possibly.
Is there no building laws where u are, or do they just give u blanket permission to do whatever u want colin
@colinfurze  What kind of laser cutting machine do you have?  Make and type?  thanks
Comedy, science, live band and DIY in one channel! Love it. But what happened to the crack where the draft came out?
Did he discover any dinosaur fossils while digging too? lol
Is it still secret if 2.4 Million people know about it?
Why not use an auger? Like a post hole drill,,,,
What was the crack then??? 🤷‍♂️
How in the hell do the secret underground house channels do it so fast?!
Is this legal?
Why is your shirt always clean?
so where was the air coming from?
Good lord son, have you never heard of a post hole digger? Or an auger?
Just one question, how will you sell tour house later ?
So im curious why you didnt make a hydraulically driven post hole drill, it would have been quite and it would've made life a bit easier
Why not perforate with a big drill?
A very British Batcave?
Wait, what was the draft? I need answers!
when will the next video be posted???
Should we tell him that everyone on YouTube knows about his tunnel haha. Joke's. Love the video
What are they doing with all of those potatoes?
191K Likes, and 0 Dislikes !?!?!  HOW??? Also, love the secret tunnel :D
So he's digging straight down into a possible cave? I've played enough minecraft to know that's a bad idea.
so how did you get council planning permission for this? or did you? lol
Is your capitol at risk? Will London crumble into the Themes?
What’s he going to do, put a Irma La Douce type elevator in it? Or a Maxwell Smart phone box? That would be good.
Runs a welder, chop saw, grinder, and bandsaw yet is worried about using a jackhammer.. Anyone else confused?
Is it really a "secret" tunnel if millions of people watch the prosses?
Any geologists familiar with that fault in the rock and the breeze he felt coming from it? I thought that was interesting.
What on earth
Why don’t you just rent one of those augers for digging fence post holes? Once you break up the soil it’s a lot easier to shovel it out.
interesting to watch, I am curious how Colin is allowed to do it - eg local council laws etc.....
Other content Creator making QandA  Colin: hmmmmmp
just curious where did u learn all this stuff, in college? if so what did u major in?
Why you didn't use a efficiency 5 diamond pick?
Why not just make your workshop sound proof?  Then you can work on loud things anytime you want.
Wait, WHAT DOES THE CRACK LEAD TO??
So many questions. Noise?  What is wrong with your neighbors?  Perhaps I should move in next door. I'm never home anyway
what Colin furze does when mum's not home
0:36 why is there crunchys in the floor XD
Dude this is wicked but WHERE WAS THE DRAFT COMING FROM? I must know!
did anyone else when they where a kid at the beach and had nothing to do just dig a giant hole for a few ours
You guys don't have a fencers bar in the UK?
A "secret tunnel" highlighted on Youtube is an oxymoron...
I wonder why you don't build a Conveyor to automatically transport the Dirt 🤔
Did you Pan the dirt for gold? You may have threw away your fortune
Why did you use the tubs instead of a wheelbarrow?
Was wondering...?? How do you know there are no giant boulders or bedrock that will block your tunnel, and prevent your cool tunnel plan?
Imagine finding a cave system just underneath your house?
Would it not just be easier to use a corkscrew contraption?
Dont suppose you could make an auger attached to a hydraulic motor and use a ram to feed it along with bits of rhs to extend the reach, be a hell of a lot faster than the other implements
DId i miss the part about  where the crack was bringing the air in?
What about a safe room bunker under the bunker...
Hey, what about that crack? Where does it go? Honestly Im more curious about following this "wind" rather than the rest of the tunnel xD
call before you dig have you called yet?
Wheelbarrow?? Woulda helped
Is it even legal to dig this deep without permission by law or whatever
Has anyone else had this feeling for the last year or 2 to dig a bunker in a secluded area . Like some feelimg that the world is about to go to shit
Could you make a electric ground auger to break loose the soil? Like the 2 stroke ones but with a electric motor to be quiet
I'm still wondering how many noise complaints he has gotten and how much is he's electrical bill
Do you need council approval to dig such a tunnel? It’s awesome.
why cut perfectly good spades and not get an army entrenching tool that is short and made for this?
Wait. What the hell is cocoa pops??? And who wants to send me a box to Texas
Colin what’s going to happen if you hit some wires while digging will you move the cut them and rewrote them?
Uuummmm, was that asbestos sheeting ?
If I was her Majesty‘s government, I would get very curious.
Why not just high pressure hose (like a pressure washer) and then just pump the slurry out ?
I'm really interested if, his tunnel will have some codes it has to meet, and if that's addressed.  Also how he will address flooding.  He's a smart guy, can't wait for him to address these issues!!
Could you maybe pickup an auger and swap the motor for an electric one?
How to become Saddam Hussein
I am very curious how his house would sell with all these modifications
how much noise could it be making that deep?
So is this adding on removing value to your property?
Where did the draft come from? I'd love to see a follow up!
So what happened to the crack where ate was flowing in? Thought you might of hit an old sewer line
Did anyone else wonder why he was wearing nice clothes while digging?
Amazing project I just wondering if you have council permission for this?
When are we going to see an underground workshop!
why are you don’t building a tunnel drilling machine?
How the hell dose he have that tie on the whole time ?😂😂
You really aren't going to show what that cave gap with airflow was?  That.. Was frustrating editing to have you mention it, and show it so much, and then just move on without another mention.
Did this require a permit?
Really you couldnt just done the work quet with the hydraulic during lockdown?
bro do you have a music playlist?
Do you also check if there is any nearby heavy construction going on or something like that whenever ur working on it?  The vibration might be dangerous
What about your Yankee viewers? We can't use the UK Apps unless they're specified for here to. Still listening to the sponsor. :P
Installing another hydraulic system?  Wait, you recorded this ages ago, did you install a pump just for this and invent a different project as a cover-up?
Did he just tap a hardened Chisel, a braver man than I.
Do you call utilities or surveyors before something like this? I can totally see someone hitting gas or water lines doing this. lol
A Brit that knows how to weld?  Is this normal?
What did I just watch
Damn!!! aren't you scared of a collapse of the tunnel under that pile of rocks? btw amazing work!! keep going i want to see the full tunnel hehe
Have you checked to manage sure you won’t run into gas or water lines?
Holy hell, I get tired just by watching you. Where do you find all that energy?
What happened with the little cave vent? I'm assuming it's still just a little crack in the wall?
I wonder if Henry and Jeannie know about this.
what did you do during lockdown? oh i was just digging a tunnel under my shed
Did he need any sort of building permission ?
Surely this must be illegal 😂
A secret tunnel number 5 on trending hmmm
As a Texan where I live you can get about 2-3 ft down before you hit clay and or rock. So, what is this sorcery of actually being able to dig a hole with a shovel?
Wonder do you need planning permission for something like this?
how many bugs did u unearth throughout the whole project
Now isn't secred
If you move out your house are you going to fill the bunker up with sand or are you just going to leave it there for the new owners
How is it a secret tunnel if you made a youtube video about it though.
Where can I buy this house?
Colin I'm building a wooden plane can I get some advise on the best wood?
So how far down did that fissure in the ground go? Definitely gonna be a cave through it leading somewhere.  Also, cant believe there isnt some sort of Collin Archimedes screw type digging thing, rather than by bucket and hand.
Can I help did the tunnel? I'm a dab hand with a shovel!
Mmm is this illegal The only concrete that I can imagine this will be illegal is Russia
I can't help wondering if this is actually legal for him to do. Lol.  I mean...not that that's ever mattered to most homeowners.
Is that legal?
If you have to do this in survival mode, why don't you just store your leftover dirt blocks in wooden chests in the attic like a normal person? I always like to have a full stack of cobblestone there as well and a few Ender Pearls just in case a Creeper parks in front of my door...
What are rules for planning permission for a tunnel?  I assume that the location will need to recorded in case someone tries to build an extension on it...
Did you realy leave dirt coco puffs on the shelf??
Why are you worried about if they will hear you? you're literally uploading all these so everyone knows.
When can we expect part 3?
3:53 I wonder if mafias burry bodies also like this
Do you not need planning permissions for this sort of stuff or there is exception for building an underground bunker and secret tunnel to compliment it.
Can you talk a bit about permission for this? Does the council know about this ?
do you need planning permission ?
What about a safe oxygen flow? Look like the hole is really deep and it might get dangerous when you're working in the hole.
Did this require planning permission?
Cant u live stream this??
When is part 3 coming?
50 fps???? Whyyy??
But why did you use a flat shovel???
How many times have you made tunnels in your backyard?
Ah shit guys. Whos turn was it to watch colin? Hes done gone and dug himself in a hole now.
Did he remember to call whatever his version of 811 is?
Waht if you neighbor watch your videos?
Have you considered large sound dampening equipment?
I want to know about The Crack lol. Colin has found something...
Also, trying to figure out how you'll react when you pierce the wall of the banks' vault and see the safe deposit boxes with all those diamonds????
I really hope he's getting advice from a professional trencher and/or engineer... That shoring does not look nearly strong enough to hold back a cave-in....
I would love to know if you needed to get planning or speak to the council about the secret tunnel system. I imagine you would have for the bunker but this addition?!?  We get grief all the time for simple things to do with builds and renovations at work!!
have you measured/calculated how many tons of dirt you must dig out? It'll take YEARS!
Where was the air coming from? What happened to the crack?
Ever had your house evaluated wonder hom much all these weird bunkers and tunnels add to the value 😅
Did I just watch you weld a big piece of pipe on onto your shovel? Had fun lifting that over your head a couple thousand times, didya?
What is this music😂
why
What about a boring machine Col with 2 wheels, buckets and a chain or rope
I thought surely they would disguise boxes of dirt as recently delivered Amazon packages and set them on the front porch. They will disappear all by themselves.
Do you need permission from the authorities to do this?  Wish I have the enthusiasm to build this myself.
Did you figure out the cause of the draft at any point?
why not make a dirt conveyer ?
12:17 can anyone pls give a hint to the track. Thx a lot!
im sorry but how the fuck does a dirt and rock hole at thee end have better acoustics than his shed haha
hey Colin, did you know that "Furz" means "Fart" in german? So from this day on I shall call you Colin Farte. I really like this certain ring it has to it :)
Wth 😳
DID YOU ACTUALLY GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY OR DID A SERVANT DO THE REAL WORK.
i still want to know whats down this crack, where does it lead to?
digging all that with only a spade?!?
any worry about gases welding in a confined space?
Is it legal? To build smt like that? No permissions?
12:16 what music is this? It's not listed in description and shazam gives wrong answers.
Do you need a building permit for that or is it considered too minuscule of a change to your property and is except like a small fish pond?
It would be interesting to know what the background radiation and oxygen level are like in the tunnel. Could you add as bonus content?
0:40 are you serious? No wheelbarrow? 🤦
Is this legal?
The madness of not finishing this under lockdown makes me wonder if the neighbors are asshats
How are you gonna sell this property later?
What happened to that crack and the draft?
Do you have a wife? 😂😂
So what happened with the crack? Where was the wind coming from? I'm digging this project!
what the heck have I stumbled upon lol
Do the English authorities require some sort of permit to dig an underground tunnel beneath your property? I wonder because in some countries you need to submit many forms and pay a considerable amount of money to get a permit for a new balcony or to set up a wall in your house.
Y are u digging this much 🤔 What is the use of it Still u are great
😱😱 what ?! https://youtube.com/shorts/JTb-2YWVRXg?feature=share
This is awesome but am I the only one wondering about the legality of this? I would imagine there would be lots of paperwork and inspections for something like this.
Did you have to get permission to do that digging here in the states we do
Can you imagine if he sold the house and didn't tell the owners
Stupid question: is that legal?
How did you permission for this
What more can this man make?
This guy is probably loaded and he still likes in a average family house and has a fairly scrappy workshop???
Lmfao was that the Great Escape ? I dont know the name of the movie I did see it however.
Does his house not have foundations?
how do you spell ''hydraulic injection injury''? colin: yes
What about that crack?
Someone's going to look at all of this in 100 years and wonder, why?
I have simply no words for this.....
Why does the freetrade link flag as a phishing link?
how much is your electricity bill at the end of the month?
Can someone please explain UK planning laws? 😆
How did your water company let you dig this??!?!
where are all the comments about the crack? where did the crack go to bro?
Did you discover your own bat cave?
I wonder what  movie the scene at 1:38 is from
But what about the cave!?
Arent there some sort of registrations of how low you are allowed to dig?
I always wonder after watching a great video on youtube. How is there dislikes on this video!!!? How, what didn't you like that 16k people missed?
hold up hes recording and broadcasting a secret tunnel video to millions of people? counter intuitive?
do you have planning permission for this?
What’s up with those neighbors? Is there anything wrong with making noise during the day?
Is he allowed to do that? I mean, by the laws of god ?
Is it still secret if there's a video of its location-?
What about a Furze tunnel boring machine to quietly dig a tunnel?
Don't the neighbours have YouTube?
were you worried about possibly finding old ww2 unexploded ordinance?
and people wonder how el chapo could dig so many tunnels with a couple thousand people helping
How about a little room down there to hide some projects if you need to🤔
Did you find out where the crack was or where it led to? Seems bizarre to have airflow that deep !
How long before you regretted not using gloves? I am guessing day 2 as someone that regularly does repetitive labor
Did you have to get planning permission? If so how did that get approved
Have you ever  thought  what will you do if water raised?
Get an engineer in there. That bit if mesh and tubing is not going to hold back all of that earth.
How do u get away with this without alerting 📢 HEALTHY & SAFETY,  LOCAL COUNCIL AND PLANNING PERMISSION? IN ENGLAND They will just tell you to revert all that work back to the way if previously was
@colinfurze  do you like skateboarding? try something with that^^
Isn't that incredibly dangerous without shoring up the sides properly?
As much as I loved the bit... I'm still desperate to know... Where's the dirt going?? 😂 Oh and... You're mad Xx
What is wrong with 800ppl who watch this?
where did all the soil go sure some one would notice
How in the hell did you gain council approval to do this? lol
I just think is this illegal
Hi Collins, tell me, would your CNC plasma cutter also work with 8mm aluminum and how good does the cutting edge then look? Because a laser or water jet cutter is still far beyond my financial means ;-) Thanks for your help and greetings from Bavaria, Martin (my project: www.scuttler.eco-warrior.de)
I've dug a lot of holes in my work over the years, everytime I do I always feel like I'm time travelling. I wonder when was the last time this earth saw the light of day, have humans ever seen this rock before?
Really what is this guy planning for?
Why not connect the garage to the tunnel system?
12:16 The last track is not listed in the intro heading, does any one know the title?
What did you do to prevent rust from happening with all that square-tubing framing?  Anyways, this project is AWESOME!!!! *looks forlornly at my own backyard to see if I can make an underground bunker.  Nope..*
Isn't this illegal??
Is this legal? ;)
Anyone else thinking He will make a box push it in with the hydralics then excavate the dirty just like they were doing 200 years ago on the london underground?
Why don’t you get a post hole digger to make larger holes quickly and easier then just remove loose soil
why not have some sort of sound barrier (on the hatch) to greatly reduce the noise and keep on using a jack hammer?
He the hell do you get a permit for this in the UK?
is it realy secret with over 1.5 mill people knows about it
Is it really a secret now?
What if you used something like huge screw like drill?
What tf? Why would YouTube recommend this to me? I must have watched something from here before? Edit: I take it back. The later half made me think it's pretty cool. But too much time wasted on neighbor judgement concerns unless laws are a factor. It's a hole, I'm pretty sure it's insulating with regards to sound
What is it about men that just makes us love digging holes?
Am I the only one who wouldn't care if he decides to make a video, where he builds the perfect secret hiding place for some dead bodies?
How many Roman coins so far?
What about the windy crack (in the rock) you found? Was it a dead end?
Has anyone seen the Pete & Pete episode, Grounded For Life? ;-)
What your frend name?
Did you download Minecraft, the live version?
How does this guy have so much energy, just watching him makes me tired.
09:07 at this point I'm thinking, "oh Colin, surely you would have installed an electric winch to haul up those buckets?" ...
What kind of education do you have? How did you learn to do this stuff?
Are there any geotechnical or structural engineers involved behind the scenes? Working underground is no joke, and there are so many things that can go wrong resulting in death - and it can happen in the blink of an eye.
Have you thought about one of those new fankled barrows with a wheel at the front..  And a hydraulic shovel...  🤔👍😂
anyone else think of the scene in wallace and grommit where grommit is chasing the wererabbit through the ground and hid wipers happen to have a setting for "heavy loam"
What's the name of the last song? It's amazing but I couldn't shazaam it :(
didn't think there would be noise down that far under ground for the neighbors to hear ???
How is no one else talking about the crack?!? I want to see where it goes now!
You think a post hole auger could could have pulled up or atleast loosened some of the soil? Where was the breeze coming from?
i dont know why you didnt make a frame with a drill that dig and scoops up to the top.
didn't you already have a hydraulic system thingy in your shed?
Was the beach hut dig practice for this?
Wouldn't blasting have been an alternative?
Colin can I suggest a large drill then do half a dozen holes then cut away at it the scrap around them. Just moving a foot at a time, might be quicker. If you it your hydraulic system, with more torque than speed might work better. it will probably be quicker than chipping away at it.
didn’t the shed already have a hydraulic pump?
Idk what kind of drugs colin takes to remain so active .
Am I the only one that wants to know what pipe he broke to find that “crack”
Is it  secret tunnel if I know where it is?
Was that Dr. Mallard?? 😲
Does anyone know the name of the song used at 12:16?
You've got all the tools. Could you make a candy drop roller?
What about the cave? Where was the draft coming from? Maybe it was a sinkhole?
Why didn't you just make a large screw like you did for your screw tank and then use that to drill into the dirt? You could have probably figured out a way to place it inside of a tube so that it would bring the dirt up to the top for you and either deposit it directly into buckets which you simply swapped back and forth or onto a conveyor belt which then fed it directly outside to the truck you were dumping the dirt into. Once you drilled out enough holes then the dirt between the holes would have collapsed and you could have then had a far faster and easier time of it.
Damn, this is very secretive
Where did the crack lead to?
huh so no foundation is laid under the house?
So what did that draft end up being? Also I'm certain it's giving you so much respect for the prisoners of the great escape who built their own tunnels while under captivity. All that dirt to get out and there's only so many places to put it.
why doesn't colin just build a mini mining drill or something?
f me, who ya going to eventually sell your house to?
The neighbours arn't already used to all the loud and weird noises coming out of the shed thats they'd notice a bit of digging ??? ;P
How is it a "Secret" when we all are watching you build it
Does he know something we don’t know?
Imagen Colin ever selling his house…
Why would you not work on it during the lockdown, what else did you do just sit in your house?
Wait... do you need/have any permit for that? 😅
1.5 million people know about the Secret Tunnel.  So in what sense will it be secret?
Me: how did Colin manage to keep his hairstyle intact whilst digging for an entire day Colin: **shows the ad** Me: oh
Wait wait wait. Did this video not hit #11 on trending?
Is he posting old videos or something because it's July now😅
How did this take to do
Colin if your council or department of housing or whatever it's called found out would there be problems. In Australia you would need engineering approval and everything!!!
Don't you need to have a miner's license to dig anything that is not garden related?
Who else is confused as to why Colin added #minecraft  (yeah I get it lol)
Colin, how many ties do you own?
will you be framing it out with full metal sheets in a similar style to the bunker?
if you want to keep it secret once it's done, how are going to roll the carpet over after closing the hatch when you go down?
Do you not need a permit to do such a thing.
Fun video! can you copyright any of these designs.
do they not have wheel barrows in the UK?  lol....
Is there a reason you aren’t reinforcing it with concrete as you go??  If I was to do it, I’d put reinforced concrete in for every metre I dug, then move on to the lower section. That way when you complete a metre section it’s completely done.
Honestly, as someone interested in different types/layers of earth and such, watching you dig and hit different layers under your shed makes me wonder if you will find any fossils? Or cool rocks of any sort? (Yeah, I'm a bit of a rock/fossil hound!) EDIT: Everyone else during lock-down finishes Netflix, Colin digs a secret tunnel LOL! I love this channel! 😃🤩🤩🤩🤩
So a secret door that you can't open from underneath because a carpet and rolling toolbox is on it, and that if you open from the top, you can't cover up and will be obvious to everyone who walks in?
Have you considered Nitropril ? Its fun makes a bit of a bang and its fairly dangerous! Perfect. Or maybe a water jet with a pump to pump all the muck out just like a dentist does.
Can someone please edit together a compilation of Colin Furze digging, except all the footage is slowed down and played to the peaceful Minecraft music we all know and love?? 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
13:20 By now wouldn't the neighbors be used to all sorts of noise coming from the shed even from LONG before Covid?
Why doesn't he have a demo hammer with a spade bit? That could've saved him ages on the dig.
How are you going to get through the concrete that is around your bunker
All of that and no auger? So weird that you wouldnt use one?
how about building a conveyor belt with scoops to move the dirt out.
Why aren't you using a water jet to bore the hole?
Do you not have an auger?😂
Ventilation, what if you fart down there by accident ???
Yo you gotta dig out that crack and show us whats in there
hey colin im not sure if ur gonna see this but this is day 3 of asking why you dont do a collab with alec steele it would be awsome
be interesting to know what kind of permits and such he had to get to do this in the UK, and how that compares to other places in the world
im curious how safe this is? like he looks like he built proper retaining walls to prevent a wall collapse but how about proper airflow and other unknown hazards.
Why do you have to hide it from the neighbours?  Especially with a youtube channel with 11 million subs you dont think theyll find out?  And, what are you actually doing to get rid of the dirt?
By his sudden need for quiet, anybody else get the feeling that Colin has maybe got a neighbor complaint or two? Possibly with police involvement?
not sure how secret it is anymore with 1.7M views
i dont get it? in australia you can make as much noise as you want during the day then at night no noise? surely the same in england?
band practice??? pssh, that is jamming! you don't gotta practice noffin mate!
how about you wash it and filter you may get gold you never know 1:26
Did anyone else ever dig a really deep hole when you were a kid?
Colin, was it difficult to get council approval to do this? What loops did you have to jump through?
What's the music name at 12:16? Super epic
I’m sorry but why not just sound proof the walls lmao
Don't you have to bleed all the hydraulics after you connect the hoses and equipment? Get the air out?
Why is he digging all of this? Don't they have Mexicans in the UK?
Couldn't you just go into creative and make a tunnel in a minute?
I wonder what the future owners will think when they find this stuff
2:56 no fake hand? where is the real Colin?
If you go sideways and it goes outside underground I wonder if it will get wet in there when it rains
Is the whole not wanting to disturb neighbours really a thing of courtesy, or is it just to ensure the tunnel really is "secret" (apart from being on the internet and available to everyone.)
Why didn't he use conveyors to carry the dirt instead of buckets
Is carbon monoxide/other heavier than air gasses a risk?  I see no ventilation  nor monitoring.
Did you call Miss-Dig?  how do you know you're not busting through public utilities?
But Colin! How do you escape back out the secret entrance or cover up the secret lid after going in?
Why the quietness? Are you still having flashbacks to the time you used a pulse jet to clear the snow off your driveway and someone complained at you? (You really should put that one on YouTube. It's almost impossible to find!)
I remember that install of a hydraulic system; are we reusing old clips?
Where did that crack lead to? Where is the air coming from?
so where was the air / wind coming from?
So I'm having a time line issue in my head. When you made your video installing hydraulics in your shed, was that video made the same time that you installed it in the footage here?  Leave it to Colin to make an amazing mind bendingly cool video, and then actually mess your mind by breaking your sense of time!  Kudos!
How's your lower back doin though
Am I the only one worried about ventilation and air in these tunnels
Why not use an auger? Even a hand one to break up the hard dirt and then use a shovel to clear the rubble.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyfxB_SqWtc
How much cocaine does this dude do?
Do you not have 5 gallon buckets in England?
Insane he didnt show any of this during what? 3 years? And the hydraulic-system he did during this and for this project. I just wonder if hes keeping something else hidden in the background during his videos, that we'll see in 3 years! Insane commitment colin.
Wonder if the neighbors watch these videos
Does your tunnel shaft sit above ground? You may need a raised threshold around the shaft entrance to make sure it cannot fill your tunnel with water.
What are coco pops lol
was that the minecraft guy that helped digging ?
His neighbours probably watched this and wondered why he is trying to be stealthy
Colin are you going to use a mini excavator for digging the tunnel for the outside bit and you could use the excavator to make the people around your house think you are putting in a water feature
Did you have to get anyone to do any land scans before you did the runner to make sure no pipework or wires were passing under? Or did you just go for it and work around if it came to it ?
please tell me we won't have to wait a full year to see the next video lol
I love secret tunnels, and your bunker is one of the coolest things I've ever seen,, but why go through the pain of making it so your neighbors don't notice if you're just going to upload it to YouTube?
Who was that Chinese man you ran into down in that Chinnel?
Question, how do you build a tunnel in Florida where your basically at sea level?
I need to find out how this man has so much enthusiasm for digging a hole.
how do you explain this when you sell you're house?
Not sure what the building dept is like in the UK, but would be interested in knowing what it took to get authorization to do this?  A few pints and a plate of banners and mash?
is it really that secret?
Have you thought about putting sound proofing up in your toolshed? It may not keep the sound completely out but might dampen it enough to work you could work a little more consistently And a little louder
I NEED to know what that crack leads to
@Colin 🤔 How are you gonna go sideways, its gonna take forever without a mini diger ? And what's the foundation like under your house like you don't want half of your house falling in do ya.. im like confused 😕
I wonder how many permits and surveys he needed.
out of curiosity, whats the temperature at the bottom of you hole?
couldn't you use a hydro excavator for at least part of this?
5 minutes in.  So many Great Escape references... I wonder when the motorcycle sequence and tennis ball toss  begins.
just a man digging a hole ey?
Seriously though mate, where did you take all the aggregate?  I’m guessing a project like this is displacing thousands of cubic yards of material.
how does your back not hurt
Anybody else worried about his hearing? I never see him wearing hearing protection and all I can think is the crazy guys going to end up deaf.
Isn’t this Saddam Hussain’s hole the US found him in?
How many dirt have you dug, must be like 100 kg or something or maybe more!!
For sideways digging wouldn't some sort of boring machine be helpful? Stabilized by the support beams on the side opposite to the dig. 🤔
Mexican cartels wants to know his location.
Afraid of making noise? You're literally surrounded by metric tons worth of sound insulation, couldn't you rig up an airtight or layered insulation "lid" for your tunnel? Hell, you even have that convenient crack-based tunnel ventilation system up and running so you don't asphyxiate! :3
Is this legal? Did you encounter many spiders? And how deep and long? Lol
hey colin,  you must have a lot of money now, how come you are still staying in the same home ?  you look like you are living very modest.
Did you consider using an auger for the soft dirt, and what about a large grinding head for the stone?
COLIN! Why haven't you built a time machine yet? I want the next part NOW ✊
Out of curiosity, did you have to get council approval to do this project? What kind of process was involved with that in regards to the legal side of things?
Next is a common project Furze / Mr Tfue building a town underground ? 😅
Why are you wearing neck ties while doing strenuous digging?
isnt ironic that you dont want anyone to know ur building this but still post it on youtube to millions of people?
I am curious, does Colin actually live at this place or is it his "recording studio" home (and he and his family live somewhere else)?  I am more inclined to think that it is second option as most of the videos I have seen of the inside look like it isn't lived in by a family.  Personally, I would love to have a underground bunker along with a secret tunnel system, especially with weather events like the Pacific North West occurring.  A underground bunker would be a lot easier to keep cool compared to a above ground house and would provide shelter for the semi-regular bushfires that we see here in Australia.
Where do you get the energy to do this stuff? I wish I could buy some from you.
Hey, I have a question for you I'm a professional plumber and heavy equipment operator disposing of soil is a major pain in the butt it has to be tested and you need a dep sticker Department of Environmental Protection in order for me to dispose of it when using a commercial vehicle. Is it as difficult in the United Kingdom?
Is he hiding the dirt in his pants like in the great escape?  EDIT: this man is a mad genius 😆
How deep is the water table there?
Awesome idea but wondering how you're keeping it secret with a YT channel.  A post hole digger would have made a bit of that easier.
Didn't he attach a plane engine on a giant pole in his backyard to swing upside down? I'm pretty sure the neighbors are used to strange noises coming from his house.
Why no wheel barrow?
Any idea of the crack and how far down it went?
Has this guy never heard of a wheel borrow?
Anyone else hearing the song "SECRET TUNNEL" frome 'Avatar The Last Air Bender'? 😂
Is that a Hitachi jackhammer...
Ok seriously though Colin, what did you do with the extra dirt? Can't wait to see the rest!
What is Colin gonna do if he wants to move? lmao
Can you make this a daily upload!!!
Colin did you have to get planning permission to do this? Would be interesting to know how that went down as I imagine it was an unusual request to be put in for planning permission.
it seems like it would be cheaper to rent a holiday spot, gift it to your neighbors, and send them for a week in spain. then just get as much as you can get done. Also sound proof the hatch and you might be fine?
square shovel to dog? hmmm
What happened to the crack
This is so enthralling.  Did you ever find out more about the crack / crevasse?
Did ever discover where the big crack lead too yet?
This is an awesome project! Looking forward to part 3... 12:16 - Anyone here can point me to this piece of music?
But where did the crack lead?  What was causing the draft in the downshaft?
Doing that without shoring is..... risky
I wonder if he got a permit or decided screw it let’s make a tunnel
Is it really a secret if you make a video about it??? 🤔
how about vacuum excavation, its quite common nowadays
omg when is part 3!?!?!
The mesh will stop small cave ins. But what is going to be the finished walls...concrete?? And how are you going to support the horizontal tunnel ? Don't want to read about crazy builder getting killed by cave in :(
Why didn't it full up with water?
Worried about noise? I would think that by now your neighbors would be MORE worried when it's quiet.
i wonder if he could have used loud tools by sound isolating the door, since the ground around him should be really absorbing and not letting anything up.
could you put some really good sound insulation on the lid and then the neighbors couldnt hear the jackhammer
Really interested in the geology of the crack you discovered. Any more information on that?
Why and why?
Ok air coming in through a crack in the limestone about 2 meters down. Is it just me or do other people see flooding issues in the future? Colin might just need a swim mask and fins to go from one place to the other in the future.
How is this even Minecraft related
My only query is did he get planning permission,,,,took me 3 years to get planning for a basement
Did the draft have a sulpherous smell?
Daft question here don’t you technically need planning permission for that ?
Build a underground workshop? =P
Does anyone knows what is the music playing at 12:16 ?
Ever going to figure out where that draft was coming from?
is this minecraft?
Hmmm secrets don't last long on YouTube
How did you get planning permission lol
Why does he not want the neighbours to hear?
how the hell do you get consent for that?... I cant even build a second bathroom without passing through a mile of red tape! 🤣
Anyone else see this and think is that Jason Nash? Idk
Is it just me, or did anyone else notice the recycled video section where he installs the hydro pump under the workbench. That's just a clip from a video from a few years ago
Can we talk about the sock bit at 1:36. I had to stop the video because I gotta process how that looked
mid september? bruh what
Whats wrong with a breaker, wheelbarrow or a conveyer so it doesn't take all year
How do you get permits for this... do you not need inspections for building this!? It's awesome btw but im just really jealous!
How long till he realizes that it isn't a secret tunnel when he releases it for every one to see
Doesn't anyone else wonder where the crack went ??
What is the piece playing at 12:18?
Im quite curious about that crack as well now. Where it comes from and all.
I wonder is that tunnel permitted?
Please tell us the story of how you Told your wife what you were doing.
Anyone know the songs used at all?
The bloke at the tip must be wondering why Colin keeps turning up each day with 8 tubs of soil in his car.
i wonder how many hard drugs he does while doing these projects
Are you tunnelling to Australia?
I wonder how this affects the land value
Hi Colin, just curious why you didn't built a conveyor system to transport all the dirt outside? That will be much fun for your back 😜. a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) that will be awesome...
Wait, didn't he already have a hydraulic pump under the table?
Can you not get a hammer drill spade? I think that would save you a lot of heart ache  and noise
Is this legal?? 😂
10:30 Is this Reign of Fire (2002) reference or something? 😅
Colin is a brilliant fabricator but here he is carrying dirt in buckets in and out of his shed I’m confused
When is part 3 going to be up?
Wonder how much noise it would actauly make at the neighbors with powertools down there.
That crack almost looked like it had building blocks on the side of it. Did you ever figure out what it was?
What’s the point in being quite, to not get caught? I mean your a pretty famous guy
Is this his job or does he have an actual job, does anybody know? Also did he go to college/uni?
wtf are cocoa pops~!??
How do you have the attention span to commit to this?? I would have gotten bored and moved on after the 3rd dig 😄
Do sound proof boards lessen the sound of jackhammer hitting stone?   An easy way to dampen sound so u can work a little louder
Where did the cave lead? D:
Okay but what the hell was that crack?
Can you send me some of the dirt
What's the name of the song in the March April lockdown ?
I always wonder if there is an easier way to dig. Maybe a pressure washer and a wet-vac that recycles the water as much as possible. or maybe some sort of drill in a chisel tube hooked to a vacuum.
Did you need permits for this?
how the heck do you have the energy to do all that digging......scratch that I see.
what about using the screw tanks wel screw as a drill youd probably have to beef them up a bit but itd make a decent dirt mover
#mincraft? Lol
How has the misso passed on this idea
Why cut down a shovel for use in the tunnel? Use a spoon like a real professional lol!
Anyone else wonder how it’s possible to keep white shirt so clean?
Any particular reason that Colin hasn't tried to shoutout to pewdiepie to use the trebuchet? pewdiepie has always said he wants to use one and it'd be a great boost for this channel I love so much!
Hi Colin, what about a post hole digger attached to a hydraulic spinny thing and a vacuum pipe to suck the dirt to the surface. ?
Is it really THAT loud? You’re like 4 meters under the surface + you also have the shed on top, which probably also absorbs a bit of sound.
Also could u perhaps live when digging the next part?
Hey just wondering whens next upload date?
Question, why is the reason you need to be quite and have the loud music going?
You didn't do any digging because of the lockdown? I thought that would be the PERFECT time to dig more, when everyone's locked in, anyway? Why did you stop then???
1:46 hows colin put these dirt on cereal box and then we get a real cereal and put it the cereal box with dirt on the market damn.😂😂😂
Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't you already have a hydraulic system in your shed? Or has this project been going on for that long in secret? 🤭
Can you call it "secret" if you make a video all about it and put it on the internet? Specially when you have 10+ million subscribers
Is anyone else deja-vu from when he built the beach hut?
Will you please help me dig mine? I love your attitude to this kind of work. Keep up the great channel mate, really enjoying it 👍😀
how deep exactly is "maximum depth" and why is it "maximum" ?
How about building a small boring machine?
Am I the only one that believes at this point Colin's neighbors wouldn't bat an eye at an excavator in his back yard let alone a little digging.  I would think the fact he's finally being quiet would draw more attention. :)
Why not a hydraulic or electric auger? I mean. You could technically use a post hole digger to drill out deep holes sideways and then use a shovel to dig the rest of it out?
Have you ever thought about buying a vacation home in Coober Pedy, South Australia ?
How does one go about even getting planning permission for this
Didn't he already have a hydraulic pump plumbed up for the shop?
Anyone else disappointed that he hasn’t started singing the “Secret Tunnel” song from Avatar?
Did you have to apply for a building permit?
So when are you gonna add an entrance concealed by bricks and rubble and Saddam Hussein
cant tell if property value is going up or down.
I still wonder about the crack. I need more info about it.
I'm puzzled. If your plan is to dig the horizontal tunnel silently then why have you had to wait until the neighbours could leave? Digging an underground tunnel sounds to me like a perfect lockdown task. But I can imagine there are several practical reasons why I am wrong, I just don't know what those reasons are.
Can't you use the system of active noise canceling, but in a huge scale, everywhere microphones and big speakers that send the opposite sound waves into the room
I’m so curious what the permitting process for a project like this was like.
are there any near kneighbours that could swap ?
Ever consider using an electric drill with a really large drill bit?
Does UK have building permits? I know you own space above and below your property but no way it is legal to just start digging a tunnel, right?
What happened to the crack in the wall?
How TF you get planning permission on that 😳
Did you ask the escaping officer about this, it might interfere with one of the neighbors tunnels
Wouldnt a screw type cutting face be better for lowering the noise, then use the hydraulics to press forward motion as the rotating face cuts, like a mini drill tool like what was used for the Chunnel, then use the brace tool after each step forward as you get away from the back cafe.
Surely you can't just dig an underground tunnel in an urban space without running into gas, water, telephone, and power lines?
I really want to know where all the spoil is going/gone? Or has mount Furze mysteriously sprung up on the edge of the property?
how is this guy not buff at shit
How do you have the energy, dedication and stamina ?
Colin have you been to the real secret bunker in Cheshire ??
Is he allowed to just dig straight down like that? Im not very familiar with what licenses and permissions one needs to build a tunnel but that mesh looks like it wouldnt be much help if anything collapsed.
I think im missing something. Did you mention why youre trying to be quiet? Out of all the times you built things in your back yard and you need to be quiet now? why now all of a sudden?
How much do you reckon the sponsor pays for a multi video series ? £100k?
Do you neighbors have internet? Maybe it is a bad idea to put something secret on youtube. :)
5:39 What happend to your right arm colin?
Where are you mans going
So did you consult like a civil engineer or company to make sure you didn't mess up the foundation of your house or have a tunnel collapse?
Why did the end of the video remind me of the film Silence of the Lambs?
aren't there drills to excavate that kind of thing? like the ones they use to drill ice for kilometers deep? surely you could've rigged something similar?
Batcave? 😃
How you gonna sell that house?
So where did the breeze come from?
Amazing! Does anyone know the Song at ~ 13:40 ?
Hang on a minute, Colin didn't you secretary cut in footage from when you installed a hydraulic pump for your press in your workshop from 2 years ago. Is that how long this project has been going on for.
Dude how does the local government not come down on you for permits and stuff. Or do you mean to tell me you get permits to dig tunnels lol.
I'm not doubting for a moment that he's not done the proper checks and that......but what's the laws/regs about Joe Public doing this? It's really cool and I can't wait to see the finish project, just curious really?
did u ever find out were the air was coming from
Band practice? 😂 You looked like mafia digging a hole to dispose of bodies!
So where was the draft coming from? Where did the crack lead?
Did this require planning permissions?
Did you need planing Permission to do all this?
imagine the confusion of a buyer if he sold his house
How is this allowed? Doesnt it damage the integrity of the land around it and neighbours property etc? really curious if he had to get 100s of permits/licenses
What if you used a hydraulic screw like the ones that are used for drilling holes for fence posts but you attach a hydraulic ram to the end to drill sideways.
Are you neighbors not subscribed to your channel?
Where the fuck is the ground water?
Why doesent colin just use acustic foam to insolate the sound
I wonder if it has to be secret cause his naighbours are arses
he really hit rock bottom, eh?
Guys, do you somebody know in what project was this song with the verse about "spot welding"? It was a slower pace ska-punk or what...I heard it on the show but I couldn't find it ever since.
I'm eager to see how you'll manage the roof of the tunnel and would love to know how you knew the top of the tunnel will hold itself
how does the city like this :D
Pretty excited for this - do you not need planning permission or anything for that? What's to stop you going through a water or gas main?
Is this movie @1:25 "The Great Escape"?
You ever find any fossils in the limestone??
Are your neighbours really that bigs a douches that you can never make noise?
Is this really a secret when over 800.000 people know about it?
First it was bike then it was a bunker what’s next a space shuttle?
Why not use an auger?
wait, so what was the deal with the space in your cavern?? i’m still intrigued as to where it went or what it was a part of
Where’s El Chapo?!?😂
Does he need planning permission to do this ???
What's the soundtrack at 12:17?? Please help me out!!!!
I bet his neighbours are wondering why the shed is so quiet all of a sudden...
Do you guys have planning and zoning laws? Because I feel like my local board wouldn't approve. 😂
Hey Colin, why not make an electric motor auger to bore into the dirt??
Oh Colin....how long would it take to make a tunnel from my shed near Boston to your man cave? I feel like there needs to be a secret underground network for sheds.
Never played minecraft?  Never dig straight down!
Do you have to get permits to do this type of stuff?
just curious but are your kids home when you make all this noise lol
So the crack leads to the Colincave?
Is this allowed to just do or did you have to get permits
If this is secret will we get a visit from the men in black to zap us with there mind eraser so we forget we ever saw this?
How come it is a SECRET tunnel if 11 milions people gonna see it?
Colin, have you been recycling old footage ? Did you not install the hydraulic pump ages ago ?
Why not use some kind of screw, like big auger for diging ? It wud be quiet, yet still move soil better than just pressing it with hydrolics
Can we spare a moment to contemplate on how strong Collin must be? He's doing all the physical work in a shirt without ever looking exhausted
I've always wondered how to properly dig something under ground with safety And there you are
Is this legal?
How long did it take u too dig that
Am I the only one who keeps hearing secret tunnel from avatar the last air bender in my head during this project hahaha
Colin what is the name of the last Song called? Little bit Orchestra Sound like
I wonder how in the hell hes getting permits to do this
Anyone else thinking el Chapo with these tunnels???
How the hell do you get the planning permission for this?
Everybody talking about the project  Me : was he with a T shirt ?
How do you manage to get council approval for all this under ground work. Safety etc.
Why does this vid have a minecraft tag?
Makes me wonder if and how he got the town to allow this. Lol
does sombody now what the name is of the track at the and of the video? it's not one of the tracks in the description
Howd you get planing permission for this. (I assume you didnt tbh)
Wondering why Colin didn't use an auger to dig the dirt out
How about a power post hole auger? You could convert it to hydraulic power..
How did ya hide the planning permission from next door lol
Epic!   I wonder if you’ve soundproofed the hatch so you can continue to work in silence. I’d bet the depth you are at now would block out most noise from your tools.
Who else thinks this man lost his sanity long ago?  He's very smart but hes 100% nuts (honestly that maybe the reason y I keep coming back to watch him)
How is this legal haha 🤣
How you get planning permission for a secret tunnel... Because if you're without permission the council will find new and inventive ways to make your life shit. Including condemning the property and demanding you fill in everything.
What happened with the crack!
When are you doing part 3
Is it me or is this CRAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZY
Can we just appreciate how much effort he puts into every video he makes
How does this guy not look like Larry the Lobster     Man’s doing digs every other month for hours without break
So any plans on building a tunnel boring machine? 🤣 Nice job keep on digging.
Wow this was filmed quite a while ago from March 2020 to April 2021 and he released it today in July 2021??
why not build a small tunneling machine ?
How do you even get a permit to do this😂
how loud could tunneling in a deep as hole in your garage possibly be for you neighbors lol.
That's not really a digging tie tho, is it.
How do I get my free share when doing the investing, I’ve already started investing using the link in the description, it really is as easy as Colin says it is, I just haven’t received my free share as of this point
Is this british dale?
How will the neighbours hear you and why does it matter anyway? They must know who you are by now. You could just fill your shed with insulating foam to cancel the noise, much of which would be diffused by the tunnel itself at this point.
I want to know where the draft was coming from? :O
Is this legal? What about power and water lines, anything else? We used to build underground bunkers when we were kids, basically a trench with a roof until a bloke came with his car and fell inside, luckily we weren’t there. This is an awesome project by the way, really exciting love it, where’s part 3?
Aren't you worried when theres alot of heavy rain for several days that the rain/groundwater might enter the Tunnel through the walls somehow? I'm not an expert in that field, just thinking that dirt/limestone might not hold off everything. You should definately consider something to prevent flooding or to get the water out if there is flooding.
How did he get the whole money for all that stuff ?
How do neighbors react to your builds
Great video and project!  I was just curious what the process was like to get permits for that there...  Here it would take years lol.
So Colin, for what are you Preparing youself?
You know something we don't know, right?   (was my first thought) :D great great!
I wonder if one day an archaeologist will find this tunnel and wonder why the owner had a massive tunnel and bunker beneath his house lol
Did he record these sponsors years ahead of time? Or did he just jump back in the hole
Cant you just isolate the hatch and close it when your working down there so your neighbours cant here you
Do you need planning permission for projects like this?
Why are you trying to hide it that much, to skip an entire year XD
You have to see if that crack goes down maybe to a big cave system!
Why not a big hydraulic auger that also moves the dirt up an onto a small chute that dumps into bucket?  After that it's just a matter of cleaning up the corner.  :P  Also, this is amazing.
Won't this damage the water proofing of the bunker
Did you block the fan on the hydraulic power unit?
Is this guy playing modded minecrafy in real life or what?
What on Earth does a COVID lockdown have to do with your ability to work on digging a hole inside your shed, Colin?
I don't know if you already got rid of all the soil but some of it was looking rather clay like it could have been processed by hand into proper homemade clay.
sound proof your shed and close the tunnel lid when down there to blanket the noise?  also get yourself a canary incase of gas :D
Try building some sorta hydraulic auger for digging perhaps?
Silly Question but when your digging Vertical why not use a Powered Auger like you would use if you are putting posts in for a wooden fence? You could do that until you hit solid rock and seems like would be faster and less work with the shovel and pick.
I wonder why excavation is never done using a suction system, like dredging in the ocean. Sure, it won't handle the stones and big clumps of wet clay, but surely it's worth the setup effort once it's running and the majority of the loose material simply gets pumped out into the yard where it can be disposed of?
But where did the crack lead!!??!!
Is Herrenknecht the sponsor of the next video?
What happened to the crack you found with the air blowing?
Does the council know that you're doing this?
Why not a big hydraulic auger that also moves the dirt up an onto a small chute that dumps into bucket?  After that it's just a matter of cleaning up the corner.  :P
What if your neighbours see this video?
So what happens if there's a earthquake and you should add a emergency oxygen system in case of a cave in or if something happens
Mmhhhh, me wonders if Colin has had numerous issues with his neighbours in the past!
Is this legal? - I would need a permit for something like that where I live...
You think it would be weird to hang out in a shed blasting music with your friends? Colin, half the time in Canada we can't get the car in the garage because we're partying in there. You know, where you can plug in a beer fridge and a stereo.
Where is the Safety Canary
Is it possible to use  hydraulics to push in and pull out a metal cylinder taking material with it? Like a sample? Do this on repeat like 5 million times
Great project, but aren't you worried about it becoming a heat sink? The structure seems sturdy enough to prevent cave-ins, but you might wanna look into getting the place insulated imo
We need to find out where that draft and crack are coming from!!
How can you dislike this video?
I really want to know, how the hell he manages to get planning permission for this stuff, seriously. and i'd love to see someone try put a valuation on his house with all this built in the ground
Do they not have wheel barrows in British land?
Now Colin, just how legal is this?
If you post it is it really secret? Great shit as always though keep up the inventions
It a very cool project just wondering does he have to put the tunnel on his house plans?
Why do I feel I've seen this video before but on a beach and digging sand ☺️ god I love watching your videos Mr furzey
roughly how many bodies could you put down there do you reckon? Asking for a friend
but what about the windy hole? we want to know what's down there :)
Day 7: In central Texas, you'd still be breaking up rocks. Soil? What's that?
So are you going to explain how you didn’t hit any pipes or anything on the way down and how do you know your not going to come across any on the sideways dig?
Colin do you ever get the council turn up and just ask wtf you're doing? how do you get planning permission for a literal mancave
With 11 million subs.... is it really secret tho LOL
I would assume he made sure there were no utilities under his property? Don’t want to start digging and then hit a sewage or natural gas line 🤣
a mini TBM?    How hard can it be?
Was anyone else worried Colin was gonna fall into a mine? Just me? Ok.
but where did the crack lead to??
How much hour do this take?
Surely the fact that he is making a series of videos on it defeats the “secret” part of these tunnels.
I have to ask... How did you ever get planning permission to build something like this?
How long until he makes a conveyor belt from the hole to a skip
wonder what permits he had to get for this?
Don't know what to call the wedge?  Well, the hydraulic atomic wedgie of course...
did you get planning permission for this one?
aint this guy a mad inventor? why not just make a big drill to help u dig down... with this dude literally any builds possibile
How can it be a secret tunnel when you've told everyone on YouTube 🤣
Colin, why don't you just gift your neighbors nice holidays? :D I'd take it if I was your neighbor :)
Do you need planning permission for underground things? 😂
Wait.  For how long has he been planning this.    Did he put the pump op for the hole or for the press????
wonder what mrs furze has to say about this whole mess
Is there anything this Geezer can't do?   I'd love to have him on site.
When does the conveyor belt system to shift the dirt get build ?????
What no elevator?
Is there a way you could make a miniature pneumatic tunnel boring machine?
Should we be concerned about how the tunnels are starting to look like Pablo’s Escobar’s tunnels?
Why did he make this vid? He's just listening to music and having band practice in his workshop?
Did anyone else get nervous seeing him in that hole with no bracing? Even after he added bracing I've got to working about foundation issues and water erosion.
Is all of the ground clay?
... is the winch strong enough to lift you out of the hole? that'd be a fun exit lmao
Wonder what do you know that I don't 😆
I can't figure out if Colin is improving or ruining the resale value of his house.
Any methane gas coming in that crack?
What types of clay?
I'm curious if he ends up building something like a small hydraulic boring machine
Can You Make Premiere Video Public For Every one suggestion from 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Ever seen the movie holes?
Did anything come of that draft? Did you find out where it went?
How did the prison guards not catch you? Can we get a kickstarter going to pay for this man's bail?
Did anyone ever tell you that you are certifiable? And I love it! Please take care for cave in's.  By the way I have heard nothing here in the netherlands. So I think your secret is safe!
why does this vid have tag of minecraft???
@colinfurze, Do you have another job outside of YouTube? Love your content smexy :0 ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥚🤌🏻🧂
Why is there a minecraft hastag?! 😂
Any plan’s for the channel’s 15th birthday this November?
New subscriber from NYC. Is Kaleb available to assist from Jeremy’s farm?
No risk of geting the whole thing filled with water, when its Rain?
Will it be a walking tunnel or a crawling tunnel? Or maybe a powered sled tunnel where you sit on something that moves through? Electric scooter tunnel? (I'm just being silly by that point, but still) For quite powered digging, what about one of those garden augers but a high torque electric motor?
wait why wasnt he worried about noise in pt 1
Who needs to go to the gym when you’re tunneling?
Next episode, the making of the Colin Furze tunnel boring machine please?
I wonder if you can build an under the hanger
What about the crack? blind?
you got a loicense for thot hoile?
Hey @colinfurze why don’t you just mak the shed sound proof?
Surely you can rig up some sort of reverse jaws of life that close as the ram pushes forward ? , or better still brace the digging arm from a mini digger against a wall and use it , maybe sliding on a pole so its adjustable ?
i mean its not that secret if its online?
This is getting a elevator right?  Right?????
Did you call 811 before digging?
Colin do you need planning permish for that or just went ahead regardless hehe
What happened to the crack? Did it lead to anything?
Why did you reuse the clip of the hydraulic pump installation
Id be scare AF of that collapsing in on me, did you already have the knowledge of the safety aspect of this or did you consult anyone? And I'd just like to say, I've just spend 14mins watching a man dig a hole.
thats the same hydraulic setup he built years ago isnt it?
4:59 is he hoovering  his hair?
Colin can you show us your muscles? I'm curious
How “secret” is this tunnel I wonder, when 3 million people have already watched this video???
What about if I already have an account...
Part 3, please, can't wait 👍😎 the danish invader, where is that located? Great project, full of respect.
how can digging a hole in the ground be so bloody exciting!!
Who else is watching this and taking notes? Lolol
Is the tunnel secret because there's no planning permission? 👀🤣 But I would like to know what the local council think lol
Will the electric engine from the pump will get enough air ciculation in the table? Those things can get really hot. Sufficient cooling is not optional.
you do know about wheelbarrows right?
Why on earth is it marked with #minecraft?
Where is the airvent, fan, and entrance covered by bricks and rubble
If that is clay, you can consider making brick.
Assuming you had unlimited energy, could the waste dirt be melted, compressed, and used as walls?
What if your neighbors watch the video though? 🤔
What did that crack lead to?  Is there a cave or something???
Colin, what has the council had to say about this new addition to the house/land?
How do you get planning permission for all your renovation projects?
Is this legal?
How did you deal with Planning Permission
Will you explore the hidden Cave you found any further? I would be WAY to curious to not do it and find out how long, deep and huge it's probably is and where the wind comes from. :D
Is that a floby?
Do you need planning permission for stuff like this?
lol did you get planning permission for this!? enjoying the vids, big fan of the channel
Did you ever find out what that crack was? Some of it looked a bit like a brick wall.
just imagine the neighbor wondering why Colin keeps hauling buckets of dirt OUT of his shed...
#minecraft for good measure I see     But why though
I was wondering when “The Great Escape” reference was going to pop up.
I think stashing in the grocery store might be illegal?
Not sure why you added the hatch before even digging the tunnel.
Where to put all the dirt? Just dig another hole and put it in there 😂 🤷‍♂️
Wondered why my Coco Pops tasted weird this week.
Wouldn't a lapidary drill with a diamond cup saw  work for that
I often wonder what Colin's relationship with his neighbours is like pmsl
How do you get approved for this!?
Furze, how do you plan to get back up?  Oh, that's how.
Is it just me or does this seem like a modern version of the great escape.
But... where was the breeze coming from
Has anyone yet gone back and tried to spot when the other part of the project first appeared in other videos to get a timeline? IIRC the hydraulic system was a while ago.
wonder if you can create enough power to spin a tunnelboring head or at least the collin version of one should make digging the first part of the hole a bit eazier (round hole than dig down and flat to make the floor )
how long ago was this filmed lmao
Did you find where that Breeze but coming from?? ;
Sounds like you're having trouble with the is this residential work or commercial work on this property from the neighbours
Doesnt he know? You NEVER dig straight down....
toilet lid up? Check toilet seat up? Check..?
Sorry if someone has asked this already, but have you had problems with your neighbors?
Do you need planning permission for this?
Just how is this a secret Tunnel ?  At present 412,440 views 🤔
What about a boring device to drill the tunnel out for you?
does he have infinite money?
Would re appropriating the screw tanks screwy bits not help out on this?
Why is Minecraft a tag?
Would re appropriating the screw tanks screwy bits not help out on this?
Colin, Quick question did you ever think about using a Power Auger for the initial dig of the Tunnel? I have a feeling that it would have made it so much quicker and easier for You.
Why not use small amounts of explosives rather than hydraulics?
I wonder what during digging a tunel you can found under a lot od dirts and rocks.
Was he sued by his neighbours? Because usually everything he did in or around his house was kind of noisy. Just guessing. I already thought: His poor neighbours :)
Is that legal
Are there not rules about digging down next to other structures? Does the limestone make it okay? Can’t see council signing off on this... unless he bought next door. Lol.
I only have one question...  how can he dig in a buttoned up shirt and tie?  That must be uncomfortable as hell.
why didn't you just buy a small spade and shovel?
Geez, why not just hire some Mexicans to do the hard work?
Anyone else ever read that book Tunnels?
How is the tunnel secret now that we all know?
Have you checked utilities/drainage drawings? Might also be a good idea to test the air down there as there could be ground gases. Would be cool if you talked over how you've made it a safe (not that I'm going to do it myself) 😂
Hey I was (almost) right about 'The Great Escape' method of soil disposal.... but the old supermarket switcheroo is much more ingenious. Also, am I the only one to have noticed 'The Ladykillers' band practice gag...?!
do you not have a wheelbarrow? gotta be better than tubs
Just a thought could you not use a Cork screw like drill ?
But when you go sideways wont the air get bad no?
How do you get planning permission for a project like this lol 😂
Why not just keep playing music and resume working during lockdown lol he obviously ran into permit issues or something and they just got approved
whats the point of being quiet when you have 11M subs..? anyway this reminds me of a real life batcave for some reason.. kinda looks like the elevator they take down with alfred in the first movie while the mansion is burning
You going to shot creat the walls/ceiling?
So is it just me or every one wondering where that hole goes
Colin, any news regarding the crack ? We need to know if there is anything behind it !!
is it the neighbors complaining or you being polite?
8:35 No safety tie Colin?  😧
Is this illegal or something? Why not pay your neighbors a visit explain what's going on and see if they are ok with the noise I'm sure they're used to your weird stuff by now
Is this legal to do? Also i hope he contacted an engineer to follow this project
I am confused about the sound issue? I can’t hear someone digging in the yard next door on the surface, how would someone hear you 6+ feet underground
If this is a secret project, putting it online on youtube kinda ruins it doesn't it?
Planning office must be like what the fuck
How can I download freetrade when im 11 yrs old!😆
you know you can buy short shovels? lol
Are you seriously just going to show that crack and not investigate where it leads?
Do you need planning permission to build UNDER your land? Lol..
is this legal
does anyone know roughly how deep the maximum depth of the tunnel is? (preferably metric measurements please).
jesus its just compact clay all the way down
Why is no one talking about the air movement and where that led to? Im curious, was that some small cavern/ crevice? Did you find where it lead to?
When can we expect the next video to be out?
Colin wheres the jet powered shovel?
Any real estate agents in the UK care to explain what happens if he ever sells this property?
So do you not need permits from the township where you are to do all this stuff?
Im curious if you needed to submit plans for this?  I would think anything more than a few ft down would need approval as you run the risk of encountering services.  Also what was that air gap you found?
how does this channel not have more subscribers than mr beast or the guy that wears make up??
How does planning permission work for secret underground tunnels? Also you might want to add some support that mesh and steel frame work with some safety ties!
But where did the crack go?
what's the point in a secret tunnel if you document every part of it on youtube? it isn't much of a secret.
Building Control everywhere else: Conservatories and garage extensions.  Building Control in Colin's Area: An underground tunnel connecting your underground bunker to your home workshop and your house??
You know while this project is stalled you COULD soundproof that shed and it would help with the noise lol BTW don't you need like some kind of approval from the local government to do stuff like this to make sure you don't get too close to any waterlines etc.? I'd imagine if you dug to close to a waterline and it ruptures it'll flood the whole thing lol
How is this secret? You just told 11M people about it. 🤔
I think it was Leonardo who used a set of mirrors to connect holes with a straight tunnel... will you be doing that?
The question isn't why am I watching a man Digging a hole, the question is why this is so interesting
what happened to the crack where the draft was coming from?
Cool but how about a wheel barrow rather than lugging heavy buckets of dirt?
Wouldn’t a small gas auger and post hole diggers to remove the spoils been easier and faster?
Why don't you insulate and shut the hatch to minimize noise? And add some kind of sensor to monitor the oxygen level...
what next , a concrete pillbox?
I wonder if Colin Gona make a secret lift to tunnel,🤔🤔
Is it just me or does the pit have great acoustics?
"whats that sound?" "Sounds like a trumpet down a 20 ft hole....weird."
Why do you want to make the tunnel in secret?
Wasn't that pump under the table in a erlyer video when you made the hydraulic press or did you take it back out and just reinstall it
Suprised he didn’t build his own Mini TBM
did you need planning permission for this? haha
Hey, the draft! Was there a supervillain cave by a Furze of forgotten history, remains of monastery robbed clean by vikings or what?
Are you prepearing for Russian invasion or something? xD
did he need like special permits for this
Middle of September? How old is this video? 11:40
Where's the jet powered shovel when you need it
Do you need any planning permission to build tunnels?
Would you need planning permission to build a tunnel?
Asking for a friend but do you need planning permission to do this ..
Is it really a secret tunnel if you post it on youtube??
Neat project. I'm not sure if you can call this a secret tunnel tho.
Whats the name of the music at 12:17?
Bunker for what ? World war 3 ? 🤔
I always wonder about the people that move into that house after him. If they're paying attention, they're going to happen across all kinds of amazing things.
Where is part 3? 🤣🤣🤣 Cant wait for The next episode
Reckon Colins had a noise complaint ?? Or neighbours hate him lol???
I can’t help but wonder, is this legal?
Is it difficult to get a building permit for something like this? Asking for a friend
What i dont understand is how he does all of this with a suit on
Anything you Find while Digging?🧐
surely you needed to get permission from planning to build this? i would loved to have been a fly on the wall in that conversation hahahaha
Why does this have Minecraft as one of the video tags lol
#minecraft? really?
colin is the beach hut is still there if so can u do a revisit pls 🙏🙏
Why you didn't call Team Rocket for digging?
wheelbarrow?
Is this legal? Im asking because I wanted to do this and always got told by other people that it would be illegal? Maaaan, I want a tunnel system and a man cave :-/
Is this even legal to do???
wouldnt it be safer to pour concrete on the walls so em are actually solid?
Why you use water though?
This isn't legal... Is it? Also, how does he know where utilities are? It would be a bummer to hit a sewage pipe.
Are you going to reinforce the entrance?
Is this legal as well? Seems like a real estate hack haha, loving it
Colin, are you going to build rotary tunnel drilling machine?
also why didn't you just buy a trenching tool? you know those military shovels ?
Why no wheel barrow?
So, since this is in the UK, what would happen if during the excavation of the bunker or the tunnel you had discovered an archeologically significant artefact or building ruin? Like, you dig down and discover a Roman mosaic?
Hang about… is this project that old it was pre workshop hydraulics? 🤔
Is that even legal to dig that long tunnel in your property?
Im confused, Why would covid affect you buliding this?
No turbo powered vacuum cleaner to dig the tunnel?
Did I just watch a man dig a hole for 14 minutes
Colin, there's supposed to be a whole network of tunnels on the south side of the town bridge ... maybe you could link up with them? :D
Is it still secret if the whole internet knows about it?
are the neighbors really that sensitive to noise?
Did you consider trench support?
Will a cordless drill and a auger bit help in that soil
Digging a secret tunnel. let's be honest, seriously is it a secret.
You going to render that mesh? Looking good, shame about your noise constraints
Whats with the crack now? Where did it led to ?
What was harder to get? Your wife's permission or planning permission.
1:57 Stupid question but was this a joke? What did you actually end up doing with the dirt?
How has no one made a minecraft reference yet????????
I wondered why my coco pops taste earthy
I have to ask what hapin to your hydraul ic system that you put in your workshop 2 years ago.  https://youtu.be/E1dTwm8Lmpc
Why don’t you just buy a drill with a spiral end and drill it out
What about making like a 2 inch wide augur bit that can chuck up to one of the big rotary hammer drills. That way it's electric and fairly quiet
What happened to the crack where the draft was coming in? Might want to keep that in check so things don't flood in heavy rain.
What happened to the windy gap Colin?
I have a question are uk laws different from us laws in that you have to get a permit to build something? like is it required you get permission or can you do whatever you want with your land?
How does he get this planning permission
now for real what do u think how Secret ur tunnel is :P :D:D:D
legally speaking, don't you have to ask for permits to dig even on your own property like in italy?
Colin is incredible, how far down has he gone? Anyone know?
Did you find where the crack goes?  Need to get some big smoke bombs, pressurize the hole with a big fan and maybe you'll see it coming out somewhere.
Just be careful pleas not to be crushed by earth
If the carpet covers up the entrance, when you try to leave the tunnel in the shed, won’t the carpet stop you from getting out? There’s probably an easy fix for this, or maybe Colin already knows about it.
Do you need planning permission for this? It’s awesome!
Don't any of his neighbors watch his channel?
Another insane project from the master! What prep work was done prior? planning permission? checks for pipes and cables?
Did you need planning permission for this 😂😂😂
Wait there was already a pump there tho y u tricking me
8:57 not better with lava?
How are you not concerned about gas/water pipes?
Where was the draught coming from.
How deep does that crevice go??
Would a pointed spade not be better? Like an entrenching tool kind of thing
What's more tiring? Digging for an hour or playing the trombone strenuously for an hour?
How the hell are you ever going to sell that house? 😂😂😂😂😂
So what was through the crack ? Also could we get the names of tunes. Some good'ns in this vid
Is this going to be linked to your beach hut
was the tunnel always there
Why didn't you use an conveyerbelt to transport the soil?
Why not make an underground workshop?!
Can you build a skatepark next? I can only imagine how insane it’d be!
Why do you insist on wearing a shirt and tie when doing these really labour intensive work days. We need a Colin Furze tank top on the go
Is anyone gonna tell him what a post hole digger is? 😂😂
honestly, its probably way more sus that he's in the shed all the time and there is no noise like he's building a world-ending death machine.
More than anything I want to know what blackmail material Colin has on the people in his local Planning department!
Did U figure out what the total volume of the tunnel will be? It’s gonna take forever
How deep are you planning to go?
How the hell is this legal
Why are you so worried about sound with your neighbors? Has there been an issue in the past?
so hes being doing this for ages and nobody knew?
I feel like the stealth and secrecy might be slightly undercut by uploading the build to YouTube
So digging is too loud for the neighbours? But they are cool with the jet bbq? Maybe the lesson is to ply them with food
Could you imagine if Colin does actually stumble upon some hidden underground cave with ancient treasures and artifacts? And it all conveniently levels with the bunker plans?
How is it secret if you post it to youtube?
Is that a sock full of soil in your trousers or are you just pleased to see me
Think the neighbours would gave noticed all the skip lorries that keep showing up !!
what about some mega hydraulic screw?
What do you mean "maximum deapth"? Keep going lower!
How do you get in and out???
What no homemade T.B.M. "tunnel boring machine"??? Or at least an electric post hole digger.
No hand-made boring machine? Boring! ;)
why so concerned about the noise? trying to avoid building permits ? haha
Could you not try sneaking your neighbours house on the sponsor’s expense bill? You could be as noisy as you like then.
Why do you upload things that happened much later than they happened? Can you not upload things when they happen, or do you just like doing it this way?
Colin literally builds machines for a living but he decides to dig a hole by hand???
Is this legal?
What is the music track that starts at 12:16? It's not listed in the description. It deserves a full listen!
Where did that Crack go? I was hoping you would unearth and underground kingdom of mole men or somthin.
Do you play minecraft or you got this  idea from somewhere else?.
i'm not sure why your so concerned about sound...i mean honestly, it's probably stranger to your neighbors when you are quiet...they probably think you're doing something shady when that happens...
What the lock down stop you from digging?
Why can't he make noise?
did you find out where that tiny cave went ?
What is maximum digging depth and why is it maximum?
Middle of September? Why is the video so old?
Colin why are you so concerned with noise these days? Given all of the projects you’ve done
No tunnel boring machine?  This cant be Colins Channel.
The other day I saw an idiot digging a tunnel with out a tie on WTH?
Why are u so worried about making noise? You're inside the ground and inside a shed, and the neighbors are inside their house. It can't be that loud for them.
The next homeowners are gonna have a head scratcher about this one
is this legal
Planning permission /building regs nightmare .... no?
Do you think he has all the proper building permits to do this?
What happens if you hit a German uxo from the World War 2 your Neighbours well definitely hear that
Dude how is that secret in any way?
could you please sing the secret tunnel song from avatar?
Does anyone know the name of the song starting at 12:16?
What is that round yellow thing behind Colin (at the end)?  Is that an air sensor?
colinfurze now has been placed under police suspicion from the noise he's making
Is this completely legal tho? I don't understand how properties work but do you bascially own it all the way in the ground or?
So maybe you try to make a simple tunnel boring machine? You have success with screw tank project, so i think you can do it! =)
The real question is if there’s going to be a platform that carries you to the bottom and top of the tunnel like an elevator but for mine shafts
alright i gotta know how did he get the furniture in there
Furze, did that need planning permission? Ide love to go to the garage underground... I would also also have the jam underground on a loop down there
Where is the water table?
The real question is where was that draft coming from!
Isnt the bit about cleaning the shelf and installing the pump from another video?
Is it really a secret if it’s here on YouTube hmmm? Dope though honestly lol
Couldn't buy a proper shovel?
So this video was supposed  to be sent last year but because of the pandemic it got delayed?
Don't you need planning permission to dig a tunnel?
I am wondering what the city he lives in thought about this and did they allow it to happen
Any other neighbors find it suspicious that he has been so quiet lately?  What is he doing in there?!  Also it isn’t a secret if it is on YouTube 😂😂.  Hands down he has the luckiest kids ever!  #DaddyFurze
Just make 2 Robots to dig and remove the dirt out ?
dont want anyone knowing you're digging a hole? not letting the council in on your secret hmm?
My question is how is Colin getting in and out of the hole?
In hindsight would you have built a conveyor?
Would an auger not have helped in some parts? Just wondering.
Can you build a roller coaster please...
Man 1: Hey bro what's your workout? Man 2: I dig.
That’s looking deep
What if the stair treadmill was used as a conveyor belt to move the soil out of the shed?
Where did that hole go where the wind was coming from ?
How legal can this be?
Did u have to get any permission by the local council to dig/mine a tunnel in the garden
why are you beeing silent when you upload to youtube anyway? or is it just to be nice bause they have a new baby or somthing?
Could you some sort of tunnel borer or Archimedes screw setup to make your job somewhat easier?
How come your aloud to dig straight down irl but in micecraft
where is the airflow coming from, Colin ?
What did the crack go  too?!?!?
why are you so quiet when building, i really dont get it. if its illegal building then they will find out anyway because your are uploading to youtube LOL
Why does this video have a Minecraft hashtag lol.
Can someone name the moving in the begging I haven’t seen that movie in years since I was little 😭😭
Did you just guys get SO confused when he put old clips from the hydraulic video?
What about the breeze or potential cave? I’m eager to know what the heck that was all about.
how long has colin had this tunnel for? I swear he had that hydraulic system in his shed for a few years already, it was there in the last shop tour aswell.
Bruh is that allowed?!
Are contemplating to maybe put an elevator there? Seems like something you'd do i think 🤷‍♂️
Why is this video tagged with #minecraft 😂
WTF did i just stumble into. Is the Monty Python Makers Show? Lols
But where is the crack which he find during digging, there was a draft going somewhere.
isn't begging to not skip ads against youtube and googles TOS? isn't that the reason they canceled WingsOfRedemption's account
What happen with the Crack in the limestone? Did he build a floor out in the shaft?
Anyone else confused why he stopped digging a hole.... underground..... within a steel bunker.... under the ground. Because of the noise🤔and he didn’t want to disturb his neighbors 🤯oooooookay🤷‍♂️
How about the dirt
I'm really wondering how many man hours have gone this project, Colin? 100's or 1000's of hours?
So you've been digging in silence... is this tunnel not-legal? Your concern for your neighbor makes it sound like they're one noisy day from reporting you or something.  I can't believe that all your other projects have been done in silence or only while your neighbors were away.
Serious question though, did you have to inform your house insurance company that you built the tunnel?
Secret? Really???
Is this legal in the UK??
The resell value of this house is going to be.... confusing.
Wait?? Jack n Gin?! Am I late to the party or something? Lol
What about something like an augur type drill to break up the bulk of it? Those things they use for boreholes for water but sideways?
How did you avoid making a well
How the hell did they give you planning permission for this haha I love it
how many Mountain dews?
Yall still locked down over there?   Damn no wonder there's so many people from the UK in Florida
don’t know if it’d rock or suck to be his neighbor
Wonder when he's going to make a claim for subsidence with his house insurance company.
Why is the music always shit in his vidos?
did you ever end up investigating that crack? where does it lead?
But where was the source of the draft?
I wonder how planning permission for these kind of shenanigans works.
Why not dig on an incline, and make the entrance last? This seems unnecessarily difficult.
Sorry, you didn't work on this during lock down??? The perfect time to work on it...
how does the city give you planning permission for all of this haha cant even get my own decking XD
Have you undermined the Council Permitted development department?
Did you pull permits for this project?
Is anyone else wondering what projects Colin is doing that either haven't been finished (yet) or don't make the cut?
Colin, question, have you got planning permission from the council?
Wont this compromise your house's foundation?
Do you have to worry about water on the tunnel?
Maybe build your own Tunnel Boring Machine?
How did you get a permit for this lol
if theres ever a national emergency colin, can i have permission to stay safe in your bunker lol
So wher can i find the plans for HydroForming with a Pressure Washer-PULSE JET?
how can your videos be so good??? HAHAHHAHAHAHHHAAAHHA love ya!
I dread to think of all the paperwork required to make something like this?! How on (under?) earth?
But, where was the draft coming from?
Add a pump to deal with potential flooding? Too bad you can't just bring 16 water buckets
What are the legalities of this project?
Hydraulic tunneling machine build on the way?
WAIT! Is it still a secret tunnel if thousands of people know about it?  Secret or not I want one lol
Colin what in hell do your neighbors think when they see you leave your house with random dirt filled items 🤣
Very cool but why don't you used a micro bagger for the digging?
Is so secret a few million people have seen it online.
10:32 yes, where does it come?? No explanation..
So... where did that crack leads to ?
What happend to the mini cave story!? 😢
How many seconds did it take for Tom and you to change out of that stuffy suits?
Are you on day rate or something Colin? 😉😆
What do you think the real estate will be when he sells the house?
I have to wonder why he doesn't just line the entire inside of his shed with sound dampening foam
can you immagine when it comes time to sell the house in about 30 years and there is massive system of bunkers, tunnels, automated robot assembly lines and a rocket escape pod hangar below the house. wonder how much that will add to the resell value.
what if you hit a wire or pipe
Colin, do you have a tool there called a "Ditch-Witch" here in the States?  It looks like a huge chainsaw on a wheeled vehicle and it's used to cut narrow trenches for gas, water, phone and other lines.  A (much) smaller version could be run by your hydraulic pump to cut your side access tunnel.
Shot crete would help stabalise walls with mesh embede ? Yes no? Stay safe Bill from the UK
What if Colin ever wants to sell his house
I´m thinking you might be able to find the origin of that void by forcing in some smoke ?
Man this is really cool. I wonder what the legallity of this is.
How the hell is this legal in UK!!!??🤣🤣🤣
What's maximum depth? Are you not allowed to go deeper? And when do you reach the batcave?
I really wonder how much these projects cost
I wonder how patience inmate digging a tunnel with only limited time and tool
Its not a secret if you're telling 11 million people on the Internet about it...is it ?
Jokes aside - did you have to get any sort of planning permission for this? Have you looked at pipe diagrams etc to make sure you avoid any water ways or sewage etc?!
..I guess safety ties are a thing in minecraft soon (or already)?
What is your neighbors are on YouTube, watching you, Your idea of secret (tunnel) is spoiled now.
It’s weird to know that Colin has had a secret tunnel door under his shed for the past few years, and we didn’t know whatsoever… wonder what else hes hiding? 🤔
What if your neightbours follow your youtube channel???? They will know even with all the "noise supression"
how is it secret if you posted a video of you building it
Wonder if hydraulic jaws would work better than a spike?  to late now ik,
do you pet a platypus? a green platypus?
Where's the bloody homemade tunnel digger???? Lol
Why not using an electric soil drill Setup?
the next owners of that property are gonna have a few questions
do you have to be quiet cos of noise complaints or are you being quiet to make it more mysterious? either way this is cool af
Most important question. Where did that crack lead to?
His neighbors have no idea who is living next door ?
How can Colin say its a "secret tunnel" then make a video about said tunnel and post it for millions to watch...doesn't seem very secretive still super cool tho
Would a hydraulic auger not have been more effective for the digging?
You need to call AskJeffWilliams
no I'm thinking if you're digging a secret tunnel why are you telling everyone, I'm secretly planning to over throw the controllers am currently looking for event organiser
How will the foundation of the building will hold? I'm just curious. (Are you not partially damaging it?)
1:26 - What is the title of the movie?
Cool idea...but why just not make a huge drill or tunnel boring ??🤔
Colin, seriously, after years of weird sounds coming out of your workshop, do you think your neighbors would even stop to think about what that digging like sound is supposed to be?
You think an auger would work better and faster?
Quick question, and I havn't seen the first one. Uhm, would having a bunker, tunnel, and (if it still exists) retractable roof thing make the property value go up or down?
this was filmed almost a year ago? edit 2 years ago
I'm just wondering what this lad's background is, did he learn all that stuff himself or if he's an engineer. I know for a fact that to do all that stupidly fun stuff you out to have some proper knowledge and skills.
Next video going sideways? Don't forget to take a left at Albuquerque or who knows where you might end up.
Installing the Hydraulic pump?!? just made me realize how long this has been in the works!
So, when will he make a hydraulic auger to help tunnel to the bunker?
@collin dose free trade work for us American money or is it only use pounds
I'd love to know how the planning permission went, if needed ofc
I wondered when he would find a powered way to dig. Digging by hand is backbreaking work lol
So, how much does this devalue your property?
Do your neighbours not watch your channel?! Wouldnt they find out about your tunnel by watching this anyways?
How did you get a permit for that?
3:50 Look I know it's supposed to be "band practice", but come on: Colin Wick? John Furze?  Loving the silent challenge also 😂
Don't tell me he left that dirt there
How cool would it be if you built a miniature version of the hugh tunnel-boring machines 😄 If it is electric it would be silent too ^^
Holy shit is that the guy from Slam by The Prodigy?
What for of transportation will you use to go to the bunker with the tunnel? Surely you won't go there on foot!
How is this an expensive project? Because you bought two shovels from WWII era?
Does your wife noticed it ? Did you every time close the carpet when she was coming ? 😂😂😂😂
I'm more surprised he is able to get council approval or managed to keep it a secret from them?
I'm sure, Colin already had hydraulics or was this project started that long ago that he didnt
So what was the crack and why was it letting a breeze through? I would have done something stupid like holding a lighter near it
Is it just me or has he already fitted that hydraulic pump before in a previous Colin furze video because when he was making his normal hand pump press into a hydraulic press I remember him talking about the Christmas tree
it looks like a madman's secret hide out, wait
If I was to do this at home what permissions do I need in the UK please? About to build a pond but a tunnel seems more fun!
Where did that crack lead? What was it in the end?
Wait so why was that crack in the hole there anyway
imagine he really put all that dirt at those places
What if he breaks the toilet pipe
How the he'll does he get planning permission.
Why does it matter if the neighbors hear anything?
Wonder how much all the hidden modifications will benefit the property's value. Should have an appraisal done after finalisations haha
Where was the draft coming from???
So when does Stamford's tube station open?
You know Screwfix sell confined space shovels?
Why mesh on the walls instead of sheet metal
So Furze, what did you do during lockdown? Colin: I played minecraft.
What happened to the crack?
Couldn't you just invent a TBM or something?
Has this project been going as long as you had the hydraulic system installed in the shed?! I thought i had a deja vû seeing the "clean up excuse" and the xmas tree
Does all that need planning permission?
Colin, was you sat directly on the porcelain?
Out of curiosity, why the shovel and not a hydraulic powered earth drill? Could have saved a lot of effort moving the mud up...
I don't know if they make these anymore but maybe Colin could've bought an old military shovel that was used for digging trenches? I'm thinking World War era. Either that or a shovel used by a locomotive fireman.
What are they doing in the roof, Roger allowed them to put the dirt into the roof
Anyone know what the music is at 12:16? thanks
Damm i was also wondering about the jet engine  :D
I’ve noticed news pundits all sit in front of book cases but they never read the books, have you ever considered making a book case book ejector, that fires books out of the case allowing you to read loads of books
My capitol is at risk? Is that a threat?
Are you calling the tunnel "Charlie"?
Why is there the #minecraft though?^^
Will we ever hear Colin throw his hands up in the air and sing "SECRET TUNNEL!" at the top of his voice?
Why you didn't make a rail to move the dirt outside?
What about getting your neighbors to help you? 😁 you could make all the noise you want and some extra hands
Dude, when is Lincoln Electric going to sponsor you? If they deny you, swap to Fronius!
Can you imagine Colin's neighbours, what the hell is that maniac next door building now ? He is not normally this quiet, should we ring the council ??
Do you have the recording of the building inspector laughing at you when you tried to pull the permit for this?
Does doing all this increase the value of your property?
Are you gonna gunite/shotcrete your steel and mesh?
spending all this time to make sure the neighbors don’t hear, what happens when they watch the video??? lmao
i really want to know here did the hole he find go to ?
Is it not gonna rot out
Can’t tell if it’s a joke that Colin doesn’t want people hearing or if it’s because he won’t have planning permission so is doing it on the secret
I wonder, does dirt count as littering 😕?
I'm just curious about planning permission because it seems my neighbours can't even build an extension for some reason 🤷🏻‍♂️
Being that deep has to be fairly quiet already no?
I wonder when the like count will reach the number of shovel swings… 😜👍👍👏👏👏👏
What are you doing up at 1am (Australia)? Waiting for the new furze video of course and it was worth the wait
Planning to shotcrete the walls?
Can we have a bet on how many episodes it's going to be? I think 20.
You know minecraft is just a game, right?
Surely you a buttload of planning permission for all this?
I have a question, why is the tunnel connecting the bunker, shed and house... but not the garage despite going nearly there on the presentation?
What do colin's neighbors hear?                                           heavy metal
What kind of permits did you/were you supposed to get to do this?
11:17 is that mr bean?
no hard hat? no safety tie? you're a maniac!
I'm not sure whether you need it for this, but have you got planning permission for the tunnel? They'll need to be checked by a professional at some point to make sure the walls won't collapse in, & if they do then for the bracing not to buckle under it.
Just asking😂.    Did you check, if there is a pipe down there?
What about the crack ?
Could you make a hydraulic screw for the sides and use that.
dude ... is it really secret   if it is posted on youtube ??
what's the music at 12:17 please ?
Did you find out where that little crack the draft was coming from is leading to?
Is anyone else asking themselves why Colin did not build a tunnelling machine ?
But where did the draft come from!?!
How does this man deal with HOA
I wonder how much value is added to his property with the bunker, the swings, and now the tunnels
11:38 Wait, if this was in the middle of september, that means this video is already close to a year old? WHAT ELSE ARE YOU HIDING COLIN!?!?!?!
Its middle of september? Colin your videos are made 10 months in advance? How can you plan that well jeez
I wonder if the neighbors follow this YouTube channel
How do you get planning permission for all of this?
how to make a secret tunnel in your minecraft base
Definitely does not look like enough clearance at the end of the electric motor on his hydraulic pump for proper cooling airflow.
What about a small Tunnel Boring Machine like what was used to dig the Channel Tunnel but a much smaller version.
Dude why are u not working with Space X for the construction of StarShip? U are a great builder thinker
How about you stop voting for people who will give you lockdowns?
Love this project you are doing! Also kinda curious how much gold (if any) there is in all that dirt coming from the tunnel
Did anybody else notice colins arm 5:36
Find any bones Colin? lol
So what was the breeze from?? Did you hit a natural gas line or a sewer pipe? lol
What happened to the cave thing you found?
please can  we have some different music to your videos...cheers
Who are the 6 people who disliked this video? Are they all Furze's neighbors?
Any the Shawshank redemption   fan here?
What no dirt conveyer belt?
You have been doing this for the  past 2 years???  Absolute madlad !
Do you need planning permission
Loves to see all the details, dont mind the dragging around since most of the build he done is skipping some of the details to make it more presentable in certain time limit.. he deserved more ads in each parts of the video.. the only problem i have is, i know he literally released this video, but where is part 3??? Cant waittt
Fill them tubs with good soil and get some good seeds and make that bunker pay for its self ? Mushrooms of corse 😉😂.
Is there problems with Karen neighbours
I'm looking for engineering uni courses, anyone got any good recommendations or useful things to know?
Don't you think its more suspicious if your shack is silent than some weird, loud noises coming out of it?
When do you start dynamiting?
Guess it is not much of a secret anymore?
So where did the cave end up going?
why, JUST WHY would you give a thumbsdown?
Love it! How the hell do you get planning permission/building control approval for stuff like this and the bunker? 😂😂😍😎👍🏻
Your Capitol is at risk? Is Colin going to attack the US Capitol? 😂
Am I tripping or didn't he already build a hydraulic system exactly like that while removing the exact same rubbish xd
Could you not use an auger?
I wonder if the waiters thought the bag was a tip or something then looked inside and found a pile of dirt lol
How does this guy not have a mansion with all the views and money he must make
Does anybody else wonder why his neighbours left? Just me then?
I'm puzzled as to why the hatch opens in the direction it does. Wouldn't rotating it through 180 degrees make it easier to life and replace the carpet? And you didn't think of maybe making a tunnelling machine?
Why is the music twice as loud as the speech? Makes me want to turn off the audio.
I seriously dont get why you didnt use an auger like a post hole digger or something, an electric hydraulic would be quieter than a shovel
Do you have planning permission this time?
4:10 Is it me, or does Colin look like Suggs whilst he is lipping that bone?
I wonder what the next owners of this house would think of a tunnel and bunker  just chilling (It would be best to keep this as a family heirloom lol)
Tell me Colin how is it secret, when 11M watches you??
Who else is going back over older videos and noticing the edge-of-carpet-screwed-to-baton they missed the first time around?
I wonder what colins neighbours think of him. I mean like playing trompet at night. Haha
I love that you have a "The Danish Invader", and in Denmark, we have english pubs :D  Also, what movies was the clips from?
Where is your mustache
How can content be so impressive while being so wholesome?
Is that even music? 😀
Do you need permits for this?
sometimes i question whether its legal or not to build a bunker in your house
Why is secret If you show this for the world?
Is it a secret we know where it is
Am I the 5th?🤣
I'm soo early??!!
