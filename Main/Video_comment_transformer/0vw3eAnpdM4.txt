When TF did be talk about race?
Why does YouTube hate deji soo much 😂😂😂😂
Playing the race card hein?
Why the race card deji? Didn’t think you would stoop to that.
Deji, do not accuse people of racism without proof of racism, please.
Wait did he just used his race card to get more attention ??? I guess he gets more attention cuz his race tf ? I guess that’s fair I see
Why did he bring race into this what does that have to do with anything
Deji you do know you aren't the only one getting strikes for bullshit right?
Shouldn’t you manage your channel and remove videos / act as new guidelines come out?  Huhh
playing the race card, seriously?
Jees do you really need to repeat the same point over and over and over we heard you the first time it's over a vid you did in 2017.
I really don’t understand what the hell is wrong with YouTube, it’s completely getting out of control with this bullshit of taking down a random video from years ago and then give a strike to the content creator. Seriously what in the world is YouTube doing?? 🤦🏻‍♂️
Kemstar. Who knows
I wonder if this happened in 2017
Why is deji always making depressive videos
Why does everyone hate deji?
Why is he so overdramatic about everything?
Did you want anymore jumpcuts with that?
It’s mad because those videos he reacted to are still up but he gets the strike??
Maybe don’t use the word “retard”? How is retard even allowed nowadays? Disabled people like myself find it very offensive
U played the race card for what?
I think he did the video in 2017.... but im not sure
You Tube... what is going on?? Is there anyone listening?? It’s run by Bots.. no communication just robotic action
Isn’t your channel your responsibility to meet the guidelines, I’m struggling to understand why @ing you tube is going to help. I’m off to shit in the boss’s garden and hopefully here be ok with it, that’s if he finds it straight away.
Isn’t it three strikes rule anyway.. ? But anyway I’m sure you can get it removed I’ve seen a lot of creators get strikes taken away recently, so YouTube are helping people from what I’ve seen!
You cant upload for a week yet you upload this video what???????
Why is he so annoyed a video from 3 years ago got deleted? How does that affect him?
Is karen in charge of youtube or sumthin?
You fully pulled the race card tf?
remember back when youtube was simple?
Didn’t this just happen to markiplier
This is off topic but do u ever plan on boxing again? Like I wanna see u box n I’m kinda sure others do to
Why can this man never be happy something always is going on
Did Deji open and umbrella inside, break a mirror and then walk under a frecken ladder? What’s up with his luck man wtf 😕
It’s only 1 strike so u ain’t really gonna loose ur channel r u?
Is youtube just managed by a giant bot
This happened to markiplier. How can you change the guidelines and the take the video down without warning because you changed the guidelines, it looks like you’re doing it on purpose to pull down channels you may not like
Why are people bringing race into everything? If anything, YouTube panders to minorities and LGBT+ people. It’s a personal attack maybe but it has nothing to do with your race, be real.
Wow.. When will YouTube stop bullying Deji, man? It's actually sad, don't worry, Dej, all will be well ❤
really? same colour as me? stop putting the race card in this smh
Why did you have to pull the race card?
So that’s why you cant get diamond play button?
How did you bring colour and race into this?
Soooo is this rip deji or what???
Just what happend to Markiplier
Idk I think it got copyright strike because of bullying and harassment idk this is just a theory guys
Deji Please ask Penguinzin/Moistcritical, he had a problem like this recently and he resolved it, ask him what he did and for the same person he had help from.
Has he really just made this into a race thing 😂🤣
When is YouTube going to learn that nobody, absolutely nobody, approves of their policies. Half of the time, they're way too strict, and the other half of the time, they're extremely neglectful.
didn’t this also happen to Markiplier.  I don’t know about the other YouTubers that had this.
Why does deji have to go through this though?
The real question here is what exactly are the guidelines here on YouTube? Prior to unlisting all of my old videos to eventually replace them with new ones whenever I bother to make new content, I've had many copyright strikes and claims for things so many others got away with, but they were able to jump on me right away, or years after the initial upload like yourself.  Meanwhile, I've seen videos here on YouTube that showed gruesome images of murdered and dismembered people, complete nudity that wasn't even censored, a nude little boy in an African tribe who was getting jacked off by an adult with a stick with no censor (no, I didn't expect to see that before clicking a geographic tribe video...), and so many other messed up things you'd think wouldn't even last on YouTube for more than a few minutes at best. Heck, there's even a video of a man and woman straight up having vaginal intercourse here on YouTube with cameras literally showing all details with no censors. It's practically a pornographic film that simply isn't being advertised as such and is labeled as "educational". I don't bother watching porn myself, but we all know there are sites dedicated for such trash. Since when did YouTube start accepting that?  So again, what exactly are the guidelines? It seems to me like YouTube just does whatever they want. I even made a video discussing the Bible once and got a strike for it...
Omg, this happened with markiplier, are youtube now looking at theyre workers and just stiking them? Do youtube want to be shut down?
Didn’t the same thing happen to Markiplier? It was resolved pretty quickly for him
Ik it’s of topic but who’s gassed for the ps5 showcase tonight
whos here before his channel gets deleted
Why are always most of the comments in his videos like: "Deji has gone through so much!!!!" "Wow deji you went through so much" Like we already know why do you keep reminding lets look for better positivity in the future.
Deji are you okay you always post emotional videos and titles :(
Can this man get a break?
What video was it?
I don't understand why they are making YouTube for kids when YouTube kids already exist , why don't they get rid of demonization already , GEEEEEZ!!!!!!
Oh and why dont you talk to TheQuartering or Markiplier? They clearly got the connects
Can 2020 get any worse😤
can anyone even with my fucking rage rn?!?
Why am I getting in trouble for killing a women in 2017?
Why does all this happen to deji only
You guys realise this is fake right?
Was there a russian man beaten by spongebob in the video? Cos markiplier and penguinz0 got one because of that
didn't this happen to markiplier and then they took it of?
Why has YouTube changed so much and I'm surprised they didn't take down nigahiga's how to be a ninja why do they have to pick on deji.
Does this means no diamond play button?
What should we tweet?
why is everyone so against deji
2:17 okay deji, u trying to bring up race into this? just because u r black?
who asked
2020 seems to be really doing some work on youtube, wonder whats next
Is it just me or does nobody realise he’s just constantly repeating himself for the first 1:30
Could YouTube be racist
What is happening with YouTube lately
its reaction content so it cant be touched no?
Deji, try and see if you can contact YouTube. Multiple youtubers have gotten random strikes recently, but if I were you I would see if I could reach out to them somehow, as some people have gotten the strike revoked by justifying the apparent "issue" with the striked video.
What's up with YouTube's Guidelines?
Nice but why use the race card?
Can we just deep the fact that Deji has been through so much these past years?
Karen, do you have something to do with this?
Dude can you go back to skits and video games shit do I one question go make good content again
Who’s here early 🙂👍🏻
What why
Why did i click so fast
