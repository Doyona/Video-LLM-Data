Why Tank looked down and seems uncomfortable when Floyd says he's proud of him? Why not smile at least? What's going on there???
Can he fight Ryan Garcia already? Garcia will get torn apart in the ring with Davis
Does anybody know if Floyd is wearin' a costume or is that jus' some corny ass $50,000 outfit made by some foreign fashion designer that I don't know about.?!
No part 2?... I was enjoying this Interview
Who will be the standout player on Seattle Surge?
Floyd will literally turn any question into a question about him 🤣🤣 he really can’t help himself lmao
FLOYD THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH A REPORTER ASKING " WHO U WANNA FIGHT NEXT" THIS IS THE FIGHT GAME. THEY SUPPOSE TO ASK THAT DAWG.
Why is Floyd dressed like the ref from Mike Tyson's Punch Out? 😂
Can ryan Garcia fight this guy?
What happened to Ramen in 2020? https://youtu.be/LwfHYfemzGE find out
Why does Mayweather look like an Amish Pee Wee Herman?
Does anyone know why Davis changed the gloves from the warm up in the locker room to fight time? Seems a bit shady to me
Why Floyd dressed like andre3000 tho???
Damn Floyd. Just answer the damn question.
The question posed to Tank was did he show much of himself with Cruz that fight? He could have killed the guy.taosted ravioli,hot! Quacamole,c'mon!

Wondering if Floyd would have been there if he lost...
Did Anybody See When They Ask Tank About Ryan Garcia, Teofimo, Devin Haney “How he fumbled the Mic For About 15 secs
“Floyd, here’s a question about Tank and the projection of his career.” “Yes. Let me talk about myself”
Davis vs ryan or lopez 。ahmmm
So nobody notice Floyd taking “the champ’s” mic and making him share with the coach’s mic?   😒
Did any of them visit a barbershop? Look like they on their AJ shit🤣🤣🤣. Good ko Tank congrats bruh
