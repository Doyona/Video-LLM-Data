Is there any way you would consider doing a football video with a couple fans maybe?
Is the goal keeper alisson
Is it just me or did the sunday league player and goalie do better than the pro players and goalie?
Is just me or does Ben foster always volunteer to be videos to enhance other YouTubers
So no one heard chunks hit that note on the “go” part when they were counting down to start???
30 seconds in does anyone see anything else???
A actual match goalpost is bigger than this right? Actually wondering
Some of bens saves makes me wonder why he retired
Why is Harry just casually without any shirt though? 😂
