Well, it’s New Years resolution time again. Will Olive & Mabel keep up their workouts and catch the squirrels? 😄
Why do I feel a doggy gym contract makes more sense 🙄??
Any plans for new episodes? I miss you three!
Where have Olive and Mable gone. I just watched this one for the second time, of course it was as good as the first time. But would like to see some new ones.
How do I sign up for this gym? The sticks had me dying 🤣
I just love your videos! Keep them coming. Isn't it about time that they get their learner permits to drive a car? It would be easier to chase the squirrels!
Do they have any plans to team up with Tesla Tedd ?
Do you think your book will ever be available on Audible in Spain?  I would rather listen to your dulcet tones than read about Mabel and Olive’s exploits.
Shouldn't they be wearing masks?
Olive,any tips on underarm flab please?Oh and by the by..that pool size ?Platinum Level...seriously?? Honestly.. can't see it happening pet.Maybe tiime for a wee note to Management.. but use Suggestion Box..you know what 'him up there ' is like!
Is it almost time for the food bowl speed challenge rematch?
When will the audiobook of Olive, Mabel and Me be available in the US? I want to hear that lovely Scottish accent regaling me with stories of your squirrel-loving Labradors.
Dumb question: which one is Olive and which one is Mabel?
Mr. Cotter...are you for hire? I have a jack Russell with attitude about everything!🇨🇦
Could I make a request for your Christmas video to be uploaded to YouTube please Sir? Happy New Year! To you & those lovely girls ❤️
Morning yoga with these two! Or would it be doga? 🧘‍♂️🐶
😂😂😂The dogs are looking at you as if to say What’s going on?????😂😂😂
Every one you make is a gem. How is that possible?
Does anyone else crack up when they see Mabel's nose up close? Don't know why but I do every time.
What's wrong with the Harmony Spa? Well it is just a bucket and hose. 😂😂 Love Olive & Mabel & their human, Andrew. Hogmanay!
I wonder if there is something wrong with me   . I love watching these videos a bit too much.
Absolutely fantastic! Do you accept cats to your gym??😂😂😂
Who down votes this???
How are you and the pups enjoying your new home?  I have a 13 year old rescue dog 🐕 and he is popular in the neighborhood.  He and I really enjoy your videos.  Please keep them coming.  K.
I look at these videos from Olive and Mabel's perspective sometimes, and it cracks me up to imagine what they're really thinking.  "WTF is Andrew saying?  Why am I just sitting here?  Am I getting a biscuit?  Whenever he holds that phone up for a long time, I seem to get biscuits."
We want to know what New Year diet Olive and Mabel are following to complement their new fitness regime. As important influencers their choices could be very persuasive. My Labrador, Cleo, loved the big bottle of 'Canine' she had for Christmas
Do you have 200 a month to spend? If so, you both must have great jobs and one sensational boss!
Will there be a supplemental chapter to go in the book about this one? ;-)
My lab is showing some interest. Wondering whether cats are allowed, she's a bit of a snob
If they don't adhere to the hygiene rules, will they be kicked out?
Does the platinum package include complimentary belly rubs?
Was there a cast change?  The white dog looks different.  Just like the Darrin change in Bewitched.
I know you are looking for alternative revenue while in lockdown, but selling gym memberships?  Loved the free weights, and the juice bar area.  🤣
Where did you  get the cloth rabbit? I think my pupperoo whould love this
Do they need a personal trainer  ??
Excellent work Mr Cotter! Will there be any spin classes for O & M ? ..... asking for a friend.
How will they find time when they're busy with their dating app ?
Is that the new garage - sorry gym?  I see the stuffed rabbit made it.
Is this part of the new year's resolution? I'd like to see a follow-up video, please. Will they make it to the "catching the squirrel" level? The suspense is already killing me ; ) (edited because of unforgivable typos)
