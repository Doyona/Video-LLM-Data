How is that a red? The keeper wasn't the last man.
Are my eyes bad or did the var stop the image wrong on the second goal from roma?
Is the commentator watching from his home? 😂😂
Don't they have VAR in Serie A? Why was the Fiorentina keeper still sent off? Were the referees blind? I just saw this video and it already angers me when I'm not even a fan of either clubs. What's the purpose of technology if the referees themselves are incompetent and shameless. I feel sorry for Fiorentina and every club that has to go through things like this. It's unfair and cruel.
Is nobody going to mention that the keeper got sent off even though he didn't touch anyone? 🤣 Abraham literally fell over on his own.
What kind of replay is this? Won't you show the line ups? Time of goal scoring moment?
So they VAR the offside goal but don't check the blatant dive that lead to a red card? Wat
How in god's name was that a red card?
Does Serie A use VAR better than EPL...asking for a friend.
Was Tottenham the problem?
Can i ask why goalie got a red while he didnt hit Tammy? Was it bcs it was dangerous tackle?
I dont see how the GK got the red card, he didnt even seem to touch Tammy. Also, I dont see how Zaniolo got the second yellow. Lol...
Tammy looking brilliant. Not so sure on whether that goalie made any contact or not
What kind of camera angle is this???
They say mou can't play attacking football what would you called this.....?😂😂😂😁😍😋
How was Mkhitaryan not offside on that 1st Roma goal? Very strange indeed, seems the refs were on Mourinho's side in his Roma debut. Still, well done and Abraham already proving Tuchel wrong. Nice 3rd for Roma there, great pass/assist.
Who needs Xaka when u have Jordan and Cristante?
02:58 The Special One to be The Special Five? Lol

Is the commentator watching it in his garage?

How on earth is that a red card, didn’t have the minimum touch 🤦🏻‍♂️

I wonder how they used to play without VAR in the ancient times
What's happening with SERIE A Commentary? It's sounding weird  Am I missing something?
