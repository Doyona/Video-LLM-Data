1:06 can someone please tell the soundtrack
What that is song?
Does anyone know the name of the song?
Why does she look like umbridge from harry potter 😂
name of the song?
Anyone know who the artist is covering Mad World? Thanks in advance 😇
Why was it such a big deal when Diana was dating someone when Charles was living with Camilla? It was like when they divorced he was allowed to do whatever but she was supposed to stay in a bubble . Talk about double standards
Was Elizabeth Lady Diana's reincarnation????
Do we know if at any point they are going to recreate when Prince Harris was naked in Vegas with those girls?👀
Diana Mosley I am guessing? Wonder where she got that last name from...
sondtrack name?
What’s the song that plays at the very beginning of the trailer? Piano, and then strings at 0:43 until 0:55 when the cover of Mad World starts.  Edit: found it - it’s all from the same song. 🙃
How does one watch this if no Netflix?
Anyone else catch the Mad World melody at the end?
Is it because of the royal family doesn’t like the crown  ?
When does this come out?
Is anybody exhausted with the Diana drama yawn yawn yawn poor Charles having to put up with the nutter
Are we suppose to feel sorry for a princess who had it all?  I liked Lady Di and her death was a tragedy as she will be remembered for ever.  However the real sadness is for people who lead of life of poverty, sickness, fear and obscurity where the world had absolutely no regard for their life on this planet.  I would say 95% of the people fall into this category.
what song is in the background
Truly, what did Diana webt through?!
Idk if I can watch this like I know Diana dies but I am hopping she doesn’t 😭😭😭😭😭 (but I know I’m going to binge watch it in one seating)
omg what is the song its amazing
Final season?  I thought they were going to do the story up to the Queen’s death?  Surely that would require at least two more seasons?
What’s the name of the trailer song ?
Which song did they used on this trailer?
why did she have to die? I still remember that day, it was just so sad and devastating!
Why not another season? It's not like the queen's final years lack material for content between the saga of prince Andrew, Harry and Megan's exit, brexit, covid 19, prince Philip's death, etc.
What do you mean by final season, we still have all of Harry and Meghan to get through
Are we literally getting an elizabeth haunted by Diana story in her death? Or do you think it's pre
Will they show the queen death in the final season? I mean she is now death so i wonder if with the IRL queen death the actor who play the queen Elizabeth will made the last breathing of queen Elizabeth II a perfect end for the series the Crown.
Why is this the final season, I thought they were casting William and Kate?

They did Diana so dirty last season & painted Charles so nicely I'm wondering if it's gonna be the same this season.
I donno y they r ending it here.... maybe some issues but they should make it till the queens death. It started with her reign and should end there too
Does anyone know what song is that at the very last few seconds where she is sitting above the sea?
Someone knows the music’s name of the soundtrack?
What is that soundtrack from 1:56-2:00? I cannot grasp it, but it reminds me of something.
Why didn’t they show charles slowly killing diana in the crash?
Why are we pretending Charles didn’t plan the “accident”?
Isn't this series about queen Elizabeth? Then why the series is ending with death of princess Diana?
Diana was an awesome soul, but Please inform me we the royal family is so adored and centralized exactly otherwise?.
name of the song?
2 parts?why?😮
Season 6?? When did that happen?? I thought this show was like 1 or 2 seasons💀
white? really?
WOW!!! So excited! But why the FINAL season??? Why not keep going??? There’s so much more…………
Why carnt they make hr look normal without that silly look and pout in case they haven’t realised she didn’t pout and look up in that way all the bloody time 🤬🤬💩
Is this season also pure fiction?
Part 1? They’re not even releasing the whole season?
Does anyone know the name of the song?
HOW does she make those casual outfits so effortlessly chic? I try and I look like Ellen degeneres
Curious to see if it is also touched upon that Diana would call on the paps herself and tip them on her whereabouts and if they will show some of her questionable choices as a mother. Or will we get the usual glorification and victimization of Saint Diana?
What's the name of the song she plays on the piano? And the name of the song that plays on second half of the trailer?
Does anyone know the name of the song playing in the background???
Is this supposed to sound like Mad World - Tears For Fears?
How many episodes is each part gonna be?
Jesus, is EVERYONE in the comments a bot? Look at the usernames and the comments. Any actual humans here at all?
Why am I getting emotional? 😭😭😭😭😭
Why is it the final season i thought it will continue till the queen’s Elizabeth II funeral the show named the crown not Diana why is it ending with the death of the princess 😢😢😢
When will this be out? Harry's wife should watch it as remember her saying she didn't know who he was when she met him 🙄... She might gain some insight
The series is about Diana only now? Will we get to see princess Margaret's death at all? Or in part 2?
Wonder if they'll cover how Diana also phoned the press to get them to come to some her private things.
Why is it two parts
Wonder if it will have the scene where she fucks the household cavalry
The actress doesn't have the voice and accent of Princess Di. Is this actress Amerian Princess?
How could *anyone* that experienced these things, those of us that actually remember it all and *not support* both Harry & Meghan? All we've seen is an exact reenactment of the *same behaviors* . They learned nothing, CHARLES learned *nothing*  Burn it all down IMO!
I’m not sure if this is healing or reopen wounds for her children
The "Paris Next week?" note is so unbelievably cringe I feel like I'm watching Final Destination
Are we gonna see the prince andrew saga too?
Okay i have no knowledge of how accurate this show is , could someone from this fanbase let me know, what percentage it is accurate ? coz i really want to start watching it but historic inaccuracies really bum me out
Oh man, is Part 1 going to end with The Car Accident?
What is this part one part two business? You've already managed to milk put two seasons over a ten year period despite condensing 60 odd years over the past seasons!
Why when one does somthing does everybody start copying?
Where is the part of William and Kate?    That’s why I’m watching.
Will they use the real or fictional event in the Paris tunnel?
Mad World?
00:35 Spencer Movie Vibe?
Anyone know who the Cover is by?
what happens next?
Who sings this version of Mad World?
can some1 tell me this songs name???
Will they also show how they got her killed too?
Is the show going to finally be accurate or are they going to continue with the lies and disinformation.
No one tell me what happens I am not caught up yet
What is everyone thinking now that Amazon put up the *ACM23X* for everyone? Was rumored for a while but I didnt think they would rly do so
wonder how many switched to *ACM23X* now that Amazon put that up? Im thinking about it badly
I want to know how many understand what Amazon is doing with *ACM23X* and how many refuse to adapt and still continue in their private bubble. This will sooner or later be in everyones brain pretty sure about that
Is it on netflix now?????
Last season? Not sure about that..
Is it just me or is Elizabeth Debicki type cast as the wife of a billionaire who wants to get out of that relationship? The Night Manager, Tenet and The Crown.
Was Princess Di 9 feet tall? Because I don’t mind remembering her that way.
wtf is this shit with part 1 and part 2.
Amazing trailer. What song is this?
