What’s wrong with this journalist dude?
I dont get what the issue is… Ethnicity and Nationality are not the same😂😂😂😂😂 Let the man be Jamaican😂😂
Why hasn’t Chris Eubank been sectioned ??
Is Eubank, Floyd May weather's Fadda, from a distance, looks like an older version of Floyd may weather, funny thus though, Eubank is too good
is jnr not his official son?
Don’t think Simon is a journalist, more like a radio host/personality, can you say anyone who works in radio is a journalist? Does that make every pundit a journalist?
It still puzzles me how Eubank Snr created a son lol!.
Two egos debating the severity of their ego.
Entrepreneur that ran a football team aground? Celebrating failure right?
What’s the craic with the sheriffs badge? He’s got a rusty one I’ll give him that
If he's not a journalist, what is he then? A boxer? A cameraman? A producer?
the real question is, then what does Simon think he is?
Why are the eubanks both smug little worms
Whats with the badge he wearing all the time
How can a grown man not know what his own job is?
So why can he fight dobson???
Is Jim trans?
Who the fck *is* this Jordan character anyway?
Why doesn’t he have the same passion about his son Nathaniel? He should be ashamed of himself
Now we're getting into the deeply rooted philosophical question we all came here for: is punditry a form of journalism?  Twats.
Did he fight a top American ?????..... Rastafari 😂
He asks people questions to give information to the public - so he's a journalist. But I use the term loosely given he's rubbish.
Harlem beats Conor Benn??? Eubank Snr is buzzing for sure, no way Harlem beats Conor Benn.
‘Who are you talking about then?’ ‘I can’t tell you’   😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why does he hate being called a journalist when that's his job??
Simon is such an unlikeable person, he hates it when he can't ask a question and then answer it for the person.
I've saved this under playlists Interviews & comedy.
He loves the sound of his own voice this fella ?
Why is simon tryna to argue like a women just looking for a argument
What's the star on Eubanks jacket?
JR to fight Canelo for respect? did SNR fight Jones? Toney? Nunn? please leave your boy alone!
How is he not a journalist?!
Hmmmm  I feel like there is a little bit of jealousy from snr with regards to his own son.
Connor Benns trainers have a strong libel case there to sue Eubank. Watch this space, if they don’t it makes you wonder
So Gary Neville , Jamie Garragher are journalists not tv pundits?
When did John Daly cut his beard off ?
Is he wearing a RUSTY SHERRIFS BADGE? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why does he keep saying dreadlocks?
Honestly what is Chris on about. When did working on the radio, writing a column  in the paper and hosting a podcast about people's life's make you a journalist? 😂
Rasta what?
How right is Senior
whats that star on his jacket, is he a sheriff? LOL
SJ is a wannabe boxer/promoter - if he is not a jouranlist then what is he?
I cant work out if Eubanks level of narcissism makes him a vulnerable adult or a unique individual who should be cherrished
Why is eubank Sr so petrified of conor Benn?
Eubank thinks Simon is a journalist, eddie hearn thinks Simon is a disc jockey.. does anyone know what Simon actually is???
WHY HAS CHRIS STARTED TALIKING JAMAICAN ? BEFORE HE WAS ENGLISH ....NOW HES A SHERIFF ....???? WHAT HE NEXT WEEK ? .....GHANDI  ?????? OR JESUS ???  THE MAN IS A CRACK HEAD
Why cant Simon admit hes a journalist why is he so egotistic
Connor benn gets way more money for Harlem than he does for that guy he’s fighting at the weekend👍🏼How can the economics be there for that fight and not the harlem fight when the Harlem fight is bigger👍🏼
When is he gunna be in a meaningful fight? You mad you been screaming how he shouldn’t fight
Why does he have so much hatred for his son?
Again with the Conor Benn talk.... Tell me why these journalists are making so much hype and talking about Conor Benn, I don't get it. Is it because his Dad who was a former champion is Nigel Benn, is that it? So what? means nothing, he's not Nigel. Or is it his padded record against guys I've never heard of with a less than impressive 14 ko's from 21 wins is what supposed to be the "Wow! Conor Benn!" selling point?   I don't want to be hating on the guy unfairly because he's not really established or had that big name fight yet, and I have nothing against, this is more at the media tbh who keep harping on about the guy like he's the next best thing since Floyd Mayweather, and for what? The guy was supposed to fight another former champions son who himself is not a champion either, Chris Eubank Jr, and he failed a drugs test before that happened. So... reel it in guys, he ain't proven shht yet, so stop bigging him up like he's won world titles and beaten top names, he ain't done either. If and when he does actually achieve that, then talk about him in those ways.
Why does Simon always try to control every topic of conversation lol? How many fields can he be expert in.
Eubank for the riddler in the next batman movie? I can't stand listening to the guy anymore.
Would Harlem fight Adam Azim or Doltan Smith???
Eubanks says a lot without saying a lot 🥴 legendary fighter no doubt but much that comes out of his mouth is outdated and just nonsense!! Harlem Eubank? Harlem vs Crawford? 😆
