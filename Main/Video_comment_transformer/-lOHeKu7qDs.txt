Was it baked by GLaDOS?
We used to call this a negro Kis in the netherlands it changed tho idk why
Why is it shaped like a makeup sponge though 😭
Maybe that what is cake look like a for them...😅
Everyone has such cute names for these, but ask your grandparents what they were called back in the day 🤐
Not sure about the rest of the world but these are called tea cakes in Scotland
Where is it ? We wana try it
Disapponting? All for views. Lol
Does it matter if it's delicious? I wouldn't mind a little surprise.
How have you made it this far in life being that slow?
What about jaffa cakes are they cakes?
Is it your first time I have seen it in Kim and Liz's mukbang channel
They call things by weird names in the UK.  A car's trunk is a "boot".  WTF?
That’s what??
Are u mad at moon pies because it isnt a “pie” 😒
Why did udo that small business  owner like that?
These are called teacakes. But everyone knows they’re not technically cakes idk why it’s called that
can you ask ‘what’s inside the cake?’ before purchasing? or is it meant to be a mystery?
What part of Manchester are/were you in?
I would ask whats in it first. (Proof cake is a lie!!!!)
What country will you find that in?
You must be new here…haven’t you heard about any of the gazillion things British people call cake that is not cake?
Perhaps, since you're not in the usa and not everything is called the same in different countries regardless of whether they share a language, you should start asking for clarification when buying food, so as to avoid this kind of disappointments? Just a thought...
Was this an intentional Portal reference? 😂
I think you mean teacakes?
Aren't they "snowballs"? Cakes usually aren't coated in hard chocolate, how could you not see that?
That can be their version of a cake. I would research what it means to them vs the American definition
these are called teacakes in england, not sure why bc they’re clearly not cakes but we also call bread t-cakes so who knows
I- I thought everyone knew those? They’re not quite my thing bc they’re so sweet but they’re quite common here
so its like a tunnocks tea cake then?
Was that an unintentional Portals reference?
In Poland we call these "warm ice cream" idk why :D
Where this at ?
Is that swiss meringue, maybe?
Isn't that considered false advertising then? I understand that you can have marshmallow cakes but it would still have a sweet breading in it.
uhm have u guys nevr tasted those 😱 …omg in denmark we eat it all the time and also for birthdays 🥳
Isn't it a hot ice cream we have them in Poland and they are really good
teacakes are amazing, but I also never understood why it was called a cake when all the different versions/brands I've had as had a biscuit base and where varied in sizes
Aren’t they filled with like white stuff We call em chocolate kisses
You should've asked the vendor.
Dude. Does that look like a cake to you.
thats why research First before conclusion..
You're calling this "a lie", only because you're expecting something else?
OMG jeanell I live in Manchester were you in picaddily gardens near the arndale centre? Cause if you were that's INSANE!!!!!
A variation on a tea cake I suppose, except wafer instead of a biscuit base and no jam
It’s called a tea cake in England do Your research before you put down small businesses who are struggling as it is tea cakes they are called I actually like them next time ask what’s in it or what it is.
Well it's called teacake isn't it? I mean i don't live in the UK but even I know that much that what they call pudding there isn't really pudding
Is this a portal reference??
Manchester in England?? I live there lol that's quite cool
Never had a kiss before? They're great!
I always wondered about this…well good thing I didn’t waste my cash
You seriously don't know what it is?-
Ask a German what these are called and you'll get a hundred different replies depending on region, age and political views lmao.
Aren't those Tea cakes (sometimes known as chocolate kisses)? That filling's not marshmallow either 🤣 Someone misinformed you HARD. This is why you should always ask the person that's selling them to describe what you're buying lmao
Isn't that a chocolate kiss? I'm from Germany and we eat those
is that super dickman? someone correct me on that
Why would you intentionally RUIN this man’s food cart??😞😞 This isn’t it.
Can I offer you a companion cube for your trouble?
What "first world problems" are these?
Uncultured af.. we call it crambo in Israel which means filled with cream. And that's how its like in Europe. Try asking before you buy something new.
I grew up in Germany eating these. No not a cake one bit but they are great.  Keep in mind when you are traveling in other definitions vary so maybe instead of slamming, you actually learn first.  Lie is a strong word and have to say im disappointed in your reaction and behavior. Nor is this marshmallow fluff so again ask and learn first. Your expectations will be aligned better
girl what why do you always complain about everything 😭
You gotta be careful asking what these are called in Germany, they used to be called the German word that translates to "N***** kisses" but is now called "Schaumküsse" which translates to "foam kisses"
Did you start a YouTube because you’re friend did ..?
Wait you have never tryed does before i wonder if there is an english name for does
u don’t know what that is...? is it an american thing or is it just u?
Wait you guys are in Manchester????
How... have you never had those before?
Try tunnocks tea cakes or their caramel logs!!!!! Idk if you can only get them in scotland, but i think they are available in England too!!!
It’s merengue covered in chocolate, personally I love it. Maybe next time ask what the ingredients are, you’re a tourist and you’re not forced to know everything

Is she offending our beloved winter ice creams??????😒😡😡😡😡
What even is that???
Were the stall owners Slavic by any chance? Cause in Russia and Belarus pretty much anything sweet can be called cake as long as it's not pie. 😂
maybe it's a german food and they use the word for cake differently
Those are teacakes. You got exactly what was advertised??
Why didn't you ask what's inside?  Sorry you were disappointed.
Did they call it a cake or a tea cake? Because that's a tea cake lol, different to a cake (obviously)
Aren't these tea cakes? They're meant to accompany tea, they are often a soft-ish biscuit with 'marshmallow fluff' coated in chocolate
It's too round to look like a cake haha why didn't you ask the seller what's inside?
Always ask what's inside? It IS a cake...
is that a portal reference for the title?
Ypu went to Europe. We don’t see some foods the same way as Americans?? Read about the history of the food you ate before saying things like that. For example to us pancakes aren't those fluffy things Americans eat. To us pancakes are flat.
Should’ve asked what’s inside 🤪
“pretend you’re at a christmas market” me: what the heck is a christmas market?
I'm going to the Manchester Christmas Market some time soon, anyone have any other recommends of what to and what not to get? I also don't like marshmallow so thanks for this.
In norwegian they're called "kokosboller",  which translates to "coconut buns" because there are coconut sprinkles on the outside. They are pretty common here, so we don't tend to mix them up. Don't know why they are called buns though, probably the shape lmao
Is that like a tea cake 😭
Yh they’re called tea cakes in England, but can see the confusion if you’re not from here lol
Isn't that a tea cake? That's what I've seen them called on packaging and stuff
It might actually be a tea cake(just a name) and it does have marshmallow fluff in it
This item is called kokosbolle. The English name is Foam ball. It is a Chocolate-coated marshmellow treat. But where does the foam ball come from? According to Annette Hoff, Scotland is a good tip. Here, the foam ball can certainly be traced to 1895, where it was sold under the name Chocolate Mallow Biscuit .
Please tell me you've had proper fish and chips already its sooo good
Well it kinda is a cake? Not the ideal one but we call it a teacake sometimes or atleast the people I know do.
It could be something else : a snowball / marshmallow covered in chocolate and coconut or nuts
that actually looks good but.. CALL IT A CAKE?
