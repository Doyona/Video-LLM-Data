My new Framework 13’s Speakers don’t work; Anybody got a solution?
this feels like a weird suggestion and this video is so old but the touch could be added to the bezel on top of the screen separately somehow, would be very expensive
Love my Framework! You still Canadian?? Or has Trump done a Putin! :D :D
What happened after 3 years?
Where can you find the cad drawings?
5 screws to open the bottom? I remember my old Dell laptop with only one captive screw and a sliding bottom that would take like a second to open and service. 😏
Hey Linus can we get an updated video on this.
day 1 of asking for an NZXT motherboard
Please tell me someone told Louis Rossmann about this XD
Why the fuck didn’t it come in one piece?
Hi Linus, I live in China and currently Framework does not ship to China or support Forwarders. I understand you’ve invested in the company, could you please suggest that Framework at least support forwarders. Would really love to get my hands on one of those bad boys.
does it work for gaming?
why am i actually so touched by the QR codes hey integrated in the components TT
11:50 why the hell would they edit it like that
When Linus said performant, how performant? does it get the same, similar or better performance than other laptops in it's class? like 4090 and 13th gen intel performance?
are the modules hot pluggable?
Anyone willing to collab on making the magnetic connector? I’m pretty much going to do it for selfish reasons of having it for myself, but if others can use it that’s a plus
how do you say completely? you know people really wants? upgradable cpu and gpu and ram and 99.9% of the consumers cant access it. because even if the laptop is elegant its getting outdated sooner and later and new ultra high end games come. what are you going to do of course throw away your laptop.
what if i just duct tape a itx board, monitor and gpu together
ok, but what if they made custom keyboards that you customize on their website that costs a little more than a normal keyboard
it seems to be quite a bit more expensive than a standard version of the same laptop and upgrade path seems a bit limited
if we buy new one and then buy upgrade everything piece by piece teknicly we just have new laptop and old one
11:53 .... why.  I'm laughing my ass off
what's the audio quality like
Anyone know what the computer at 0:13-0:14 is?
What happened to project aria?
what are the editors on? and can i have some?
Why aren't there gaming laptops like that?
time will tell and since time has passed, where is it now in the consumer facing mindshare of what to use, why it matters and who it's really for?  Some in the forums said it'd go the way of the phonebloks
The only problem I have with it is that I want amd processors in this thing and I’m curious on how it games or if it has a discreet GPU
what kind of gpu is in it?
where do i buy that?
Can the display can be replace?
When will they ship to Belgium? Can't wait to put one together ^^
was this guy in it at some point
Hoe do you feel about it now?
how to upgrade macbook pry the back plate off unsotter the ram if its the model that has the ram soldered on the motherboard resotter it glue the back plate on
Can we have it designed to run dual channel memory?
I’ve often wondered why no one has build a modular motherboard for pcs.. I googled it today and found it was an aprils joke a while back but why has no one ever built a modular motherboard it must be possible..
There is one thing that I miss about older and thicker laptops, they have better cooling. I wonder why cooling in laptops have gotten worse?
One question? How is gaming on it? I am rocking a 2012 macbook pro on Linux mint 20.3, and yes I tricked it out with the look I love about Mac OS and the much loved user functionality of windows. Its a frankenstein to say the least, but I love it either way. I have upgraded the ram from 4 gb to 8 and swapped out the old HDD for an SSD equivelant in storage.Thats the only hardware upgrades fro almost 10 years of ownership. I know that my baby won't live forever and I am on the market. This company looks like what I am looking for, but I wanna know if I can run Witcher 3 or Doom (the new ones) on it with blowing it up?
Is that a USB C port to USB C port?
I was considering buying one of these as a laptop in the summer, though decided to give it a few more years to see whether theyre really worth it
Are the "chip" like mods allowed or rated for very many changes or switches/swaps from say USB c to display port?
I'm sorry but why do people like small slim computers I always think that's really ugly.
16:14 But, by default, there's no way to toggle battery disconnect from within an OS?  Might there be a utility for Windows and/or Debian to do this?  If not, is that because it's not even possible for such a utility to work while the system's fully booted up like that?
Stock options?
Question. What is the potential of ordering a new main board with new CPU at a discount compared to a new laptop, and plugging into your 3 year old rig (3 years from now)
Will the Usb-c stuff work on other OS?
Why can i find this in google?
Why am I watching a video of a computer that I can't afford to buy for the entire life?
What about the GPU?
it's a great product, I just worry, as with many of these projects, that their target market is too niche. Like tech heads will love this. But will your general consumer want this? I don't know, my guess is "most" people just want to buy a working product for the lowest price, they don't want to customize it, they don't want to upgrade or repair it, they just want it.  I hope that's not the case but it may be...
can you upgrade the gpu too?
why havent you dont another vid on this? is it because they have gone down hill???
this needs to be the future of laptops. I asked various computer shop owners if they could install a 4000 series GPU. Shop owner>>>☹️
what if the cpu module was "replaceable"  the cpu block of the motherboard would be linked to the rest of it could be via pci and had a different power connection direct to the battery/power adapter
I still wonder when this can be available to the mass consumer
Is this PS1?
Why is there not enough capital in this company to have anything in stock ? Why are we waiting months for these to ship.
So seriously, no one has an answer to what happened at 11:54?
We gonna get a followup vid on this?
Amazing!!! How about working with linux?
Very useful to have modules. One of which is wasted for the charging port. What the fuck were they thinking?
So guys do you know whats crazy? I cant spent 2000€ for this awesome machine right know, but its modular with spare parts so I wonder if its possible if I buy part by part, month by month 🤔 so I could split the bills over the year. That would be awesome!
can you remove the camera and mic and run without it? I like the hardware switch but I personally would rather just physically removing them if possible
How much upgradability do you want  Desktop manufacturers: yes Framework: yes Other laptop manufacturers: No
Doesn't anybody make non-gloss screens for laptops & monitors anymore? They've all moved to annoying glossy screens just so they look cooler when turned off. We're dang tired of looking at a reflection of ourselves & the room whenever we're in a normally lit room, near a bright window, or outside. Most of us real computer users don't need a touch screen (they're for phone people). These glossy screens are a huge deal breaker for watching videos, movies, playing games, or intense reading. One has to set the brightness painfully bright & shorten battery life to just barely outshine our reflection.
When is the upgrade video coming out?
Huh ?!??!???!!!??!? 900bucks !?!??!!!?                          Sorry, I was buying one
“Wheres my type a” sounds like an angry question directed towards apple without context
Ok. That guy’s girlfriend dumped him right???
what about dedicated graphics?
So question, does it come with a video card for gaming?
I wonder if you could have Linux on it... I can't imagine the compatibility troubles
Hi. Where can I buy framework laptop?
Anybody remember phonebloks/ project Ara? Pepperidge Farms remembers.
can you draw on that type of track pads ??
Did I hear wattercooled Framework laptop?
I'm sorry, but where does the $300 of savings from self-assembly instead of pre-assembled figure come from? The laptop in DIY configuration STARTS at $749, and that is before you even add the wi-fi card, storage, ram, power adapter and ports to the configuration, so the starting price is incredibly misleading, unless you want a laptop with a CPU, battery, screen and keyboard, and nothing else. After all of the lowest cost options for a fully functional laptop are added (power adapter included) the price ends up being $1,021, which is more than a pre-assembled one at $1000 for the cheapest model (can be cheaper if you don't need certain ports). What gives? What is the point of the DIY option if it ends up being more expensive to assemble a laptop yourself?
What about gaming on it?
It seems like these only come in a 13.5" size.  I prefer my screen to be 17.5"
Do they ship to Turkey and do they have more options to The keyboard with different language alphabet and can we have a numpad? Would also be happy if they made compatibility for Ryzen CPUs aswell :) my mind is right now full of questions and stuff but i guess this much is enough for now 😁
do you have all that stuff in the box when you buy it or do you have to buy it  sepertly.
but can it play games!?
anyone know how the company is doing?
Works with Linux ?
can it run KSP? I think it can't but maybe it can do 4k part craft
AMD CPU option?
what if you can't scan the qr codes?
what about gaming performance? ik im nearly a year late to this lol
what are the Passmark results for t he different options? Great video.
you can't choose the graphics card but can you change it yourself?
1:37 I wonder, does LTT have Linus insurance?
I was wondering whether or not I could theoretically hook up a Desktop 500w power supply and a Desktop Graphics Card
How would it handle to M play games? What all could it run graphic wise?.  Laggy or over heat?
Awesome but what about GPU options?
Did i miss the gpu?
Not sure what the deal is with some companies making hard to upgrade / repair.   HP (Elitebok range) and Lenovo Carbon and T Series are all easy to get the back off and upgrade RAM or SSD's. Maybe Apple and Microsoft should learn from them.  The HP's are quite attractive, admittedly the Lenovos are a bit ugly.
Okay stupid question maybe - why do you want your laptop to have a touchscreen? What are you tapping on?
have you ever looked at a lenovo thinkpad? I have 2 of the 400 series, socketed(and upgradable) CPU, 2 memory slots, a few PCI slots for WiFi and stuff, one can be used for LTE or an SSD the DVD drive can be replaced by a HDD case, or you can slot in an extra battery(one of 3 available battery pack locations) got all sorts of ports on the laptop, and once you put it in a dock you can run 3 monitors with DVI, VGA or HDMI, get 10 USB ports and whatever  for 200$ you can pick one up in good condition, with dock and 2 power supplies, parts are still available
Can I connect an external GPU? Cuz that would be insane if you could
Why can't they make the CPU and GPU removable /upgradable and not soldered to the motherboard ??
I mean aren't all microsoft laptops easily repairable and upgradable?🤔
Would by one now if it was 9:16, also I know this is too much to ask but graphics card options?
Bezzle and different color LED keyboard is an upgrade ? LOL ,good luck to that company. Upgradeable lapptop would be: detachable CPU and GPU chip.
Ok so where does the graphics card go?
Linus connected the wifi module's wires not in the correct order. I was wondering if it still works.
Hey Linus, why don't you try to make a DIY magnetic charging port yourself? People are 3D printing themselves now, and it seems to work great!
So this is pro-consumerism?
Wouldn’t it be easier to make everything upgradable
Hmm I wonder can you ship back old components and get some kinda credit for next purchase 🤔
can it play games at max rez?
How major companies will react about that?
the modularity is super cool but 1000$ for a i5 11th gen and 256gb of memory laptop doesnt sound very nice
Third party upgrades anyone ??
why is their website only showing  up i german, trying to change it does nothing :/
Not sure how leaving this video up after you invested in the company in any way ethically ok. LTT really likes to blur the line between a review channel and a corporate shill. shill - an accomplice of a hawker, gambler, or swindler who acts as an enthusiastic customer to entice or encourage others
i wonder how it would support ubuntu
Can this thing do gpus?  Feel like that might be a weakpoint
Will there be a version with a dedicated graphics card?
What does one need an upgradable laptop for? I have been using the same MacBook for over ten years now and it still works just fine. How much more lifetime do you hope to get out of a machine like that, especially since the displays will degrade over time and keyboards tend to get less reliable, too?
Can u do a video about what would happen if the framework laptop dye?
Even tho it’s modular…how powerful is this thing really? I like lightweight laptops but how powerful is this laptop and how expensive can this framework laptop get?  Update: $700 price point for laptop not bad but doesn’t support AMD or Nvidia GPU…would need to get a eGPU AMD or Nvidia wise to plug into this thing…framework laptop has intel processor …certainly not for video editing, music production, VFX work on this laptop but maybe enough for programming and office productivity…
framework and dbrand collab when?
So is the goodix reader linux driver native to the framework? I thought they were pretty firm on their stance to not support open source thus nixing linux as a whole.
A type c adapter that plugs into a type c port?
So... all those little IO cards are just USB C ? Meaning you can use them on another computer with an USB C port ??
Waiting for it to be available in Mexico uwu… Also, can someone explain me what is the 100 dólar deposit for?
what is the brand of that laptop. really want to buy 1
Give us an amd version pls framework
What's the average duty's cost if you buy in Canada ? Do I need to expect a suprise bill ?
why dont just make a Thinkpad X1 without everyting soldered to the board? I mean a X1 made like a T430... On the T430 you can switch to a FUll HD Display as simple as with the framework Laptop...The T430 was one of the best upgradeable Laptops ever made. You could even change the CPU...
Wonder what ever happened to that company (or maybe it was a kickstarter) that was this same concept but with a smart phone. So if you wanted a huge battery you could have a bigger battery and a smaller 1unit camera, or if you wanted a really nice camera or cameras then you could sacrifice the size of the battery back peice etc and many other options / and removable /replaceable peices. Honestly don't remember if they snapped in together or if they were part magnetic, but it was a cool idea especially for instances if you like shattered your phone screen
How to buy this laptop???
60hz? Free is too much for a device with 60hz display.
But can it game?
Fantastic. What OS options do these have?
looking for a new dj/production laptop wonder how this one would perform ????
How linux compatible is this laptop? Is there a sacrifice on the battery life? I wish these results were avalable for me to consider this even more seriously
So I noticed this laptop is 3:2 aspect ratio, does anyone know if it can be run in 16:9 with upper/lower letter boxing?
What the- I am having goosebumps. Is this a dream?! Does a laptop like this really exist somewhere out there?!
Hold up didn’t g skill buy the sponsor spot
It's possible change the processor?
where's the GPU?
Is anyone else horrified how fucked Linus phone was
Which Gen is the USB 3.2?
Gimme a beefy one with gaming performance and a numpad pls?
are there going to be AMD cpus?
Am I the only one who is not interested in having touch screen for a laptop? I’m struggling to think of a reason why I’d need it 🤔
Who moosh it cost?
not sure how many port a motherboard can support but I think it will be better to prebuilt some usbc ports coz it's really not enough input for normal user
Its a laptop why would you want to upgrade it
9:56 You mean you don´t care, right? 11:34 Ooh, that's a nasty cough! 14:47 Wait, what?!
$1000+ and no discrete GPU? Come on
is the future can we see a framework touch laptop?
Do you think there will be a 15in model in the future with a changeable graphics card board? I would buy that in a heartbeat!
Here's what I don't get, the expansion cards look like they use usb-c to plug in then why do I need usb-c cards, just take the card out and plug in the cable right?
No GPU? Only integrated ??
I mean I can commend them for what they're doing, but the big but, is there really a market for a product like this? Seems very niche. The average joe will never even open up their laptop and just buys a new laptop when they feel like their current isn't up to par, after some years of use, the laptop will have scuffs and dings on the shell and most likely obsolete form factor/tech, and so they won't want to swap in a new motherboard and other pieces.  Not to mention the other various laptop markets to think about, ultralight's and gaming laptop's have their shares as well. This product doesn't compete with them in anyway or form, this laptop is targeting the middle-ground aka the office laptop market, I'm saying that these people are not interested in a product like this. So that leaves us with a niche market of people who are high advocates of right to repair and opensource.
What's the point of this if you can just download a graphics card FOR FREE on the internet?
how hard for an ejectable battery?
Did he just nunchuk a laptop? 😆😆
No gpu? Not fully customizable
Can windows 11 work on this product?
Can I get a double thicc one with at least 5 USB A ports?  Should also free up room for socketed CPU and GPU.
I wonder if people will actually upgrade their framework laptop or just buy the new model
Where’s the link to buy ?
Hasn't Fujitsu or Toshiba done something like this?
how is this laptop for video editing?
Hold up, you save $300 if you assemble it yourself?  Tha sounds like a no brainer.  Holly frick, this is amazing, I hope they will be a successful business.
what about video cards ? gaming and so on . know its a start up but that info would have helped alot
Is the GPU upgradeable?
Does Framework ship to Southeast Asia  or other East Asian Countries?  That's the question I have
11:28  That is the face of a man running some quick maths to see if he can invest
soo... is it possible to connect a proper gpu into this for gaming?
what kind of mother board is in it
Hey linus, have by chance done a dedicated 2.4 ghz setting video on mesh routers before?? Just curious
What about a bigger version with an upgradeable GPU in the future?
Are they looking for an analytics/BI person?
I wonder what would it take to integrate a power bank to each of these expandable slots so it would last for, say, 24 hours
do you plan on covering the MNT Reform?
0:13 interesting what laptop is that??
but. DO THEY ACCEPT CRYPTO AS PAYMENTS???
Will they be doing UK specs? UK keyboard and AC adapter?
I'm thinking, the main challenge of Framework would be to supply all of these parts or compatible parts for years. Will I be able to put a fresh CPU with motherboard in the same enclosure in 10 years from now?  All those slots are not very expandable. The true expansion cards work over the motherboard bus (ISA/PCI/PCI express, etc.). But those cards work with USB controller.  And there is the limit to the size of that card.  But that's not bad first step, but still far from old laptops upgradability. Looks like engineers sacrificed some features against cool thin tiny look.
Is this the real life?  Is this just fantasy?
Can I detach the mic and webcam and leave it without that and the bezel look ok?
what happened at 11:53
Will they offer a 360⁰ hinge? Does it have an ethernet port?  Is there a compatibility or bottleneck from using a USB interface for modular additions?
Me wondering why my 2yo MacBook Pro is slow af
Does it game tho?
I have just one question: Does ist have ALL the status LEDs?  Like wireless activity & state, battery state, ssd activity, mute (microphone and speakers),...?
So can you put in another motherboard with a new CPU in it when you remove the old one?
what i do to my speaker and headphone jack when it broke on my asus laptop? i remove it. my laptop become lighter. 🤣
My old HP Pavillion 17in had a PGA socketable CPU, and I was even able to upgrade my i5 to an i7. There was no IHS, so it cant really say that the CPU took all that much more space then a soldered one. Bring that back plwase?
Is that a galaxy note 9 in 2021?
The abortive soccer neatly develop because recorder biosynthetically squeal during a living battery. questionable,  fresh gauge
But where's my discrete GPU?  If they offer a model in the future that has a place for one, I'm sold.
So it has the usb dongle built in?
I have a question about the charger. It has been a few hours science I mailed the Support team of Framework, but I cant wait because I need to buy the laptop in USA and send it to Argentina (it's my actual residence country). The charger only supports an input of 120/140 volts or supports 220/240 volts? @
Shouldn't you do a metrics video?
Can't the USB C expansion have two USB C connectors on it? Is there enough space? That would be nice.
15:28 How about the Volta Spark, it does support 60W
Could it be possible for chipmakers like Intel or AMD to make special thin laptop CPUs that slot in with their own connecter, like M.2?? Just a thought 🤔
I'm wondering why you didn't casually disclose you are an investor in this company from this video.
I need to know if my Steam games will run on it so I can cancel my Steam Deck reservation! (  JK... I'm not canceling it, but I'm intrigued by this product and may buy it also.
Does anyone know if the laptop can support touchscreen input to be used as a tablet as well? Or is it too far ahead to assume?
Who is here after the investment video?
Unfortunately, not available in EU yet! Not sure if they can ship from US to Europe tho? How about the taxes?
What about dedicated graphics?
Wil this be usful for video edeting on Adobe or Resolve?
Wait, Linus watches anime!!??
Is there a graphics card in this thing? (dont get me wrong, i absolutely love it, but i need dedicated graphics)
External gpu build ?
This is the product that Google couldn't do, but framework? >:)
This is completely random but is yur name actually Linus? Just wondering cuz its so close to Linux lol
Sexy-Thin: How does a "thin" laptop work better than a thicker one?
Does microcenter sell framework?
why do your videos play at 30FPS, like whats the point of recoding 4k or even 1440P if its 30FPS bing back fps over res
Call me when they have GPU options, and a reasonable price point. ~1100USD for my base needs on a 13.5" screen and no GPU is not great.  Also, what exactly are the storage expansion cards? The prices on them are comparable to the WD Black SN750 SSDs they offer, I think the only concern would be cooling them if they're doing a lot of read/write operations, and of course they are slower than the M.2 options, but still SIGNIFICANTLY faster than an HDD. I assume it's an SSD solution, despite the performance being much lower than similarly priced M.2 products.
$2500 for a laptop with no graphics card? Are you serious?
Anyone else triggered that Linus connected the wifi cables the wrong way around?
Did anyone point out that you plugged the wires wrong on the wifi card?
Why not update it?????
What games are you able to play on it? It isn't able to have an external GPU right?
So it is technically possible add a TPM to this laptop and run windows 11?
Can you even plug in the components into other pcs? If the 1TB drive is usb c I should be able, right?
How much did your order cost?
Hi, i have a question. i have motherboard ASROCK H410M-HVS and a 500W MegaMax power supply and GTX 1650 Super OC Phoenix. I want to know if I can ugrade my graphics card to rtx 2060 and would i need for that a better PSU or not. Thank you in advance.
So what's the betting someone try's to buy them out/off??
I love this product but what is the gpu ?? am i blind ? cant even see it on their website :) ?
but what if you boot off those drives to allow yourself to secure separate operating systems...hackers would love something like this, bitcoin wallets....
No Canadian store yet?
Am I the only one who reacts how careless and whimsical Linus handles the laptop and the components? Almost dropped it straight out of the box even.
How linux-friendly is the hardware?
Do these not have an option on graphics?
Thinkpads - Am I a joke to you?
Liuns ask Elon Musk to send you his version of his latest components in a laptop version using his newest technology and see what's possible in his world on loan only for a few days see if its possible to get a draft of this technology
Does it have the ability to use thunderbolt since it's an Intel CPU?
Does this guy live in a giant IKEA ?
I want one, but i live in germany. Any idea if this is going international?
Who makes these subtitles? Why is "seque" spelled as "segway"?
Anybody know anything about GPU's and this? Could this be a content creation laptop?
Where's the upgradable dedicated graphics option? It's the main thing that I always want to be able to upgrade on a laptop.
What about the video card? Is the upgradeable? Or is that locked to the motherboard?
C'mon already.... When are the AMD Ryzen options coming?? Please all add your voices to this request!
sry if its a noob question, but what abt the graphic cards
Where’s the gpu
Recon this might be a good choice for a low end gaming pc at some point?
well, where is the graphiccards? ;(
Is there any poll or something related that laptop owners wants this modular laptop? Cuz if its below somethinh, you wont get any money
What about a GPU
I might customize a pc I need tips it's for drawing
Penguin crying in the corner😂😂😂 Understand the joke?
But can I add an optical drive?
How will windows activation on OEM key work on this ?
Does anyone know where I can invest? And/or are they selling shares
module for a bigger steam library.. does it have a graphic card ? how well would it play AAAs ?
Oy, who can grab some clips and put together why Linus likes wired mice please? I'm a hack at video editing...
ONly 13.5 inch at this time or have I missed something?
When disassembling something I have always thought why dont they use screws. Why the glue? Why the plastic clips? PS So many broken plastic clips!!!
Why "activate windows" was showing up in the screen? Did it come without OS ?
I’ve seen people use a board with an outline to show where to replace screws-colors will make it easier. Do you take a photo of circuit board before removing screws?
Do dey ship to Mexico? I want one.
Linus can you talk more about the company and if you ever bought the laptop would love to see more in-depth opinion on both laptop and the company
Does... Linus buy segues to sponsors? I don't think that's how it works
Linus  got a crazy Q and A for you need to know where these days i can get a oil pc kit know its way late look cool any help would be cool
I could not see, but it looked blank. But did that keyboard panel have lettered and numbered keys?
Great respect for the modular design... please allow the shipping for Germany.  one question though, what about a gaming graphic card?
why  they are not allowing optane intel as the cache
Where’s the NIC expansion module? Or right, they don’t have one. 😢
U use a wired mouse it it doesn't run out of power in the middle of something? ;)
Motherboard interchangeable?
Linus watches anime?
Why not have more parts replaceable? like the screen and lets call it a "CPU module" and a "GPU module" (which would still be soldered on, but replaceable)...  so you can switch out some ports here and add small SSD, so what
but, can it run crisis?
Fully modular laptop with hardware kill switches for camera and microphone?  Wow, there must be a god lol
Is there any product roadmap or launch schedule of framework's future product?   Looking forward to have AMD-based news, AMD CPUs consume less power.
Outstanding video about what looks like an outstanding product. You didn't talk about warranty? Is there a warranty or is that somehow against the point of a device like this?
But how would it handle being used as a gaming laptop?
@Framework if another company offered to buy your company for a lot of money, would you sell?
Did Linus really hook up the WiFi antennas the wrong way around?
When did Asmongold start a tech channel
Hackintosh?? Anyone have any ideas if this could become a source for Hackintosh laptop once they release a risc chip?
Why do the USB-C expansion cards not have two ports? Seems like it would fit just fine. (Maybe not so much for USB-A, but two ports there would be great too)
wasnt tbe dell alienware upgradable?
What does it cost ? Like sub 2000€ ? Great :)
any idea when theyll start making phones with the same philosophy? you cant even hard reset phones anymore because the battery isnt removable nor is the interior accessable without prying off the screen. i want to be able to change out a camera module, a speaker module, a screen module, a battery module, etc.
Is there a cellular data attachment???
Is the processor and gpu modular? That would be a deal breaker for me
Not shipping to the UK right now. :(  Also, does it have thunderbolt? That would be awesome!
I so want a larger version of this laptop so I can get a numpad and bigger battery, or posibly gpu?
Good idea but not great for main PC due to lack of graphics card. Any info as far as that goes?
Is it good for gaming?
What about the screen? Is it usable for graphic design, photo, video?
This guy suffers from childish ADHD or he just sniffs cocaine before every filming?
is the GPU upgradable?
@1:58 is anyone surprised to see that Linus' phone has been dropped quite a lot??? I for one am not
How nice if battery is in the middle, motherboard is at left and right. And they could have more space to design slot in ssd, graphic cards, even processor in future. Because battery outdate is slower then the rest.
what about Keyboard button's labelling, Linus????
Wondering what score ifixit would give it
anyone know if this laptop is good? its 950 dollars. ASUS TUF Dash 15  (2021) Ultra Slim Gaming Laptop, 15.6” 144Hz FHD, GeForce RTX 3050 Ti,  Intel Core i7-11370H, 8GB DDR4, 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD, Wi-Fi 6, Windows  10, Eclipse Grey Color, TUF516PE-AB73
My only concern is... Does it come in black?
There is nothing written on the keyboard?
Why is he acting like this? Is this some sort of childish channel or something?
Waiting for price
Linus, let's discuss about what phone would be a worthy successor of our Galaxy Note9
Why the keyboard looks so ugly?
So can I upgrade the CPU like I can in my current laptop? How about the GPU? Oh wait, both of these features were already available but so not cost affordable that no one bothered to upgrade GPUs or CPUs in laptops when the parts cost a fortune, sometimes even more than desktop parts. AAaand no, CPU is soldered here... so... not upgradeable. There are still laptops with socketable CPUs. Would rather get that.
Think y'all can do a review for linux compatibility? Like an actual installation of something?
Maybe I missed it but what operating system are they running?
Does the Framework Laptop support Thunderbolt 3/4?
odd that there is absolutely no info on the gpu nothing in this video or on there website :s?
What is going on with windows activation. Went back through the video and couldn't find a key but could possibly be one  of the QR code? Really good concept and can appreciate the design and brilliance that went into it. Just wondering about if they are sent with a genuine copy of windows.
When will it available in Germany?
Whether you can easily replace your battery or not is a big deal, sure. But modular I/O? Why not just use adapters or a USB hub? Too complicated or ugly?
18:26 - coupon for free wireless headphones - must be used in-store…. umm… if we don’t have a store in our state, and can’t travel, what then? 😔
It can handle an Ultrawide or large 4k monitor too?
Does any one remember the mega man anime? I am getting battlechip wibs from these adapter/expansion cards.
How about tablets.
How can order this brand? asia for
What the laptop name?
hey can you make the best pc for sim racing im interested to see what you do.
so is there no graphics card option for this laptop?
I love this, honestly tempted to support it, but would like to see a LITTLE MORE practice before buying.   Also, was that right? 3*2 screen? WTF, thats... different.
Could we get a case comparison for cat owners? I have been looking at CORSAIR 680x and realized that the cat would be jumping up onto the tempered glass top. I then thought that pethair is a real concern and a pet friendly case review would be cool.
So the motherboard, CPU & GPU / APU can be changed / upgraded seperately ? I think for me a discrete GPU option to swap out would be most beneficial and future proof your investment.
Does it run Linux, tho? Can you try?  :D
Has modular ever worked for anything that's meant to be durable and/or practical?
is it correct that i'm missing ethernet modules?
Ehm .. upgradable wireless in notebooks ? I've had at least 3 enterprise grade notebooks (Dell & HP) where I needed to flash a hacked bios/EFI to bypass the manufacturers stupid whitelisting which doesn't allow you to use the slots for whatever you want ...... Is this not a thing anymore ?
So when are they going to release a 15" version with an included num-pad on the keyboard?
wait, what about a bigger screen and GPU?
is this laptop good for gaming????
I think the detach battery bios option is for when you are going to disassemble the laptop and not really for running it of the wall. Also this and the Power on AC attach options are fairly common
Was that a note 7
Is it possible to buy only the spare parts and assemble the whole machine out of spare parts only?
why is he making the video in a kitchen lol
why does linus still use note 9
Hmmmm. I need to figure out if I can build a Framework Laptop that will be an upgrade and replacement for my current gaming laptop.
One question do they support thunderbolt for an external GPU.
I'm in the market for a new laptop right now. What could possibly go wrong if I decide to be an early adopter and just buy this?
Magnetic charging? *cough cough* Voltar?
The cheerful enquiry univariately explode because bowling coincidingly object through a frantic cat. untidy, bizarre growth
which brand laptop is this ?
wait why did you pay the sponsership instead of the other way around?
So what screen manufacturer do we have to agro to get a touchscreen made to fit this laptop? Imagine being able to home upgrade the screen to touch. Damn, third-party vendor heaven.
4:52 apple ? (🍏) 🤣🤣🤣🤣 they  are actually making their products more difficult to repair every model, because they want you to pay a ridiculous ammount to fix it, a youtuber broke the screen of her macbook air, they charged her $700, wow with that money i would buy a new decent laptop.
Dell XPS the gold standard as far as flex goes? Uhhhhhhh MacBook Pro.......
The big question is will parts be available? A product is only as good as the parts distribution.
So, no Ethernet Jack?  Yet... they don't sell an expansion card for ethernet at the moment, but might in the future... Weirdly, it's almost a deal-breaker for me although usb to ethernet dongles are a thing. Otherwise, I just love the whole idea and execution. Add an ARM board that rivals Apples M1 and I'll take three and won't even whine about no ethernet.
Can someone help me? If i order this nice machine, but want to do heavy video editing, is there a solid way to run a external graphicscard?
wouldda been nicer if the usb-c module was actually a hub (two ports, or more if they'd fit) rather than just a passthrough.
For how much longer are you guys gonna wear those masks? life goes on friends
where can i buy one, link?
Im wondering tough if they ever make a modular gaming pc. As i dont see any way to upgrade the graphics cards, or even buy directly(atm its not worth it anyways) from them a graphics card from the get go. The modular system is great and isnt expensive, would buy if it was also focused on gaming aswell as it might make me change into buying a gaming laptop.
Do they come with an AMD based model?
What GPU options are there
Here a question in the bois when enable the battery disconnect does it still charge or it doesnt.
Whats a ITX?...for external graphics cards?
Are we gonna address what occurred at 11:54?
Do they have a facebook page ?? :)
Love the idea, but where's the Ethernet port?
Why was the graphics capability totally avoided? Seems unbalanced review avoiding the main question
is there's model for Belgium market?
Ugh why does the Canadian prices have to be so much more it really sucks
but will they make a gaming one?
How's the cooling though
where's the option to upgrade GPU? it should have it to attract more consumers
Could they do something like this that would work well for businesses? Like we have to order new laptops relatively often because they crap out or users drop them and the cost to repair is the same as a new one.
Where's the MXM slot + heatsink?
fingerprint sensor with Linux driver?!!?!?
What's the name of product, and maximum size, please?
Why would I want those square modules if I have USB ports already
11:27  ahaha whats with that look
Arent the modular slots just proprietary usb-c dongles?
Cool idea, but you are counting out this comapny acutually producing upgraded modules in the future. And modules that are reasonably priced
Anybody else paranoid he's going to drop or break the device?
where to order?
i7 4 cores? i'm out. Unless Intel fix these names so that they actually MEAN anything.
but is is a sustainable business model?
What ever happened to those swappable laptop gfx cards that used to exist?
Ok great…do the suckers sell it with Spanish keyboard layout?
why are there connectors?
Did I miss it or was gpu on the framework not mentioned. I just went to order and I don't see option for gpu's thanks in advance if anyone can let me know
How about tpm 2.0? Can this run windows 11?
Is this guy related to Ron Popeil? But wait, there's more! Need another espresso lad?
Please post an update on the pricing. Simply comparing the prebuilt and DIY models with the same specs results in the DIY model being around $100 *more* expensive, rather than $300 cheaper, and I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a feature or a bug
No dedicated GPU for $1000? I'm sorry little one
Can you activate windows on this laptop?
Do they intend on making a larger size laptop?
what about the graphics?
and when you want to change the monitor?
Seems great isn't it ? A few questions however : Ethernet ? Bluetooth ? Graphics ? Can I plug it a docking station including charging ? How cool does it run ? Windows 11 ready ? Love the headphone jack :)
Love the idea, but have one complaint. What about the video card? I don't see an option to upgrade it nor do I see reference to it when going through the website.
Amazing product, really excited for the future of this company and it's products. I wanted to know if ( say sometime in the future, the performance isn't on par with the contemporary laptops ) can the laptop owner use the laptop's display as an output display of some other device?  Really hope you ( LTT or framework ) investigate this and reply back. Thank you.
But can it game?
Did you say soder? Thats rude. I think you meant solder.
Can you upgrade it to have a firewire socket?
where on earth is the name of this laptop and producers????
11:20 So should I wait until the RISC-V motherboard is available or could I just swap it out?
What hm what about the GPU?
So run a graphics card external?
Do all those ports front off a shared USB controller?
What if one of those QR codes is a rickroll. Hmm
16:20 - Is it smart enough to turn on the battery if you try to power it on while unplugged?
How can I invest in this company
What graphics card and what capacity graphics does this thing have?
This looks awesome! I went to the website and was picking out what I wanted when I didn't see anything about graphics cards. What is the solution there?
WHAT ABOUT PORTUGUESE SUBTITLES?
1:07 okay but why a box within a box 😂
For those of us who detest Windows, how does this awesome laptop do with Linux??
can u add gps tracker to track ur laptop!?
would you recommend this for gaming?
do they provide a keyboard with full-size arrow keys for those?
When was the last time Linus was this excited?
But wait. If the CPU is directly soldered to the motherboard, how is it COMPLETELY Upgradeable?!
hmm only english keyboard layout and usa power adapter....wired
Can you upgrade the GPU? 👀
I sure hope the power button/fingerprint sensor is upgradable. My XPS 15's fingerprint sensor died and Dell was entirely no help while it was under warranty.
I wonder is that the New X220?
Is the motherboard/CPU replaceable when that needs to be upgraded?
My concern is this, is the company a computer sales group, or a module systems group? When people size up the usb c connector size, what stops everyone from undercutting these guys? They just become expensive hardware manufacture resellers. I don't know. I'm torn. I love it, but I worry that it might have unintended side effects.
How about standardization of laptop parts like mainboard, gpu-io, battery’s fans and other stuff. Like the industry did on desktop computers for 40 years?
Damn, this thing is crazy. Can it run FreeBSD?
How does that work for the lobyists against the right to repair? :)
What difference will it make once all these parts don't exist after 2 years? It'll be yet another "modular" laptop on the big "has no parts available" pile.
can it handle 2 external displays with 2 HDMI ports?  if so, I'm basically sold
But, will Windows 11 Run on it?  :)
Are the switches mechanical? Do they ghost more than two simultaneous inputs?
My only concern is, it doesn't look like it is doing GPU (Switchable) or even Dedicated GPU.... Dell for Alienware keeps wanting to start doing the switchable GPU (area-51-m laptops) *Second Attempt* but doesn't look like it is getting off the ground as they hope. I wonder if this company can push a more harder approach for those gamer lovers to have someone like this but more in their environment.
Everything looks good EXCEPT WTF KIND OF KEYBOARD IS THAT!!!! NO LETTERS AND TRANSPARENT I HATE IT!
Not to be rude or anything but why the "Activate Windows" at 17:11 ?
Can you game on it?  Like gta
I the motherboard replaceable?
I don't see the possibility to change an apu? Is that available?
Why would you buy a segue to a sponsor?  Doesn't that defeat the purpose of sponsoring??
Are they planning on implementing a dedicated video card in the future? I checked out their site but could not find it.
How to make a device un-repairable at all and how to justify it by any means  - billions of R&D  👍🏽
So are these literally just USB 3.2 ports? Can I plug a long cable into one of the ports for whatever? (not that this makes sense to do)
damn why am I running minimal software only? I wish I could justify buying such a powerhorse with such good of  a philosophy behind it!
Is this integrated graphics or dedicated gpu
Do anyone read Terms of Services anymore? Or EULAs? Or License Agreements?? or any of that nonsense?  I like to call it terms of nonsense, License of nonsense and bullshit agreement
1.3k dis  why??? btw thanks ltt for making a vid on Framework.....
Did that keyboard have transparent caps?
What would happen if they had Apple‘s R&D Money 📈📈📈
After upgrade, what do you do with old parts? If I can sell, that is good. If not, I just dump inside a drawer and left to rot. I will rather buy a new laptop, and give the old one away since it is still working as a whole. If it is getting too old, I just convert it to ChromeBook.
I am looking for a new pc that is rbg so can you help me with this problem?
Where is the GPU?
8:24 also a USB-C to 10GBit NW Card there?
What about gpus?
What shade of blue are those cabinets?
Can you upgrade the graphics card?
Is it suitable for gaming ?
Can u play minecraft on it? Over 60 fps?
Any plans for GFX card?
am i the only one who thought that PC was a coffee machine?
why are your dudes still wearing masks like a sheeple drone
why they still wearing masks
Hm what about GPU upgrades still missing
How many years until they are bought for 500 million dollars, by a "big-box" company, and then nerfed?
Can't you have the same kind of modular features with Panasonic toughbook 55?
What about the GPU? What are the specs there?? Is it soldered on?
i really like this but... GPU... is that modular? can you add a GPU into this laptop? i'd like to run my Unity projects into this thing.
does this run windows 11 is the support on the level of asus?
What laptop was that at 0:14?
Will it play Most AAA games on Steam?
Name of this Company?
Why is he presenting this in the kitchen?
Okay, but can it run DOOM? No for real, can it run DOOM Eternal at 4K HD at 60+ FPS?
It's modular? Heck, the military is gonna be all over this.
When you said 4 mil between sensors, did you mean 4 thousands of an inch? As when you said it, I heard 4 mm as mil and mm is often interchangeably used in UK, then it occurred to me that in American woodworking videos that's how that use the term (thousands of an inch).
Are you going to do a rain test like you did with the XPS?
Why can’t they just create a laptop that doesn’t break/ need repair 😂
Presumably u have to go through them for all upgrades?
What Graphics card is in these things though? Just wondering because that's the ONE thing that is NOT listed on their website.
When is this company making car
How has this man go from a normal respectable man you a homeless guy you forgot has been in the couch for the last 3 months
you seem to have missed one key detail. how much more does this thing cost compared to a similarly specced "conventional" laptop?  a quick bit of research confirms what i suspected. that these things cost more than double. so how do i justify upgradeability when i can just buy a brand new laptop at the end of it's lifespan with the spare money i have left over after not buying one of these? if i upgraded everything on this laptop - effectively replacing the laptop - presumably it would cost more than just buying a new conventional laptop.
11:35 -- Did you say, "Dell" or "Adele"?  Joking aside, this laptop has the potential to be a game changer.
What would you upgrade in your existing laptop that you really wish you could but can't? HDD to SSD? Yes you can. More Ram? Sure. Better wifi? Probably but is that typically an issue? Gigabit Ethernet? Ok, cheap dongle. Video outs are usually good enough as supplied.
IS CPU UPGRADABLE?
But does it come with all those attachments? Or is that gonna cost me an arm and a leg? 😅
so the question is what do they do when a customer screws up. i don't want to be paying for others mistakes, there should be no warranty as such. unless you can reasonably prove manufacture defect.   you buy it, you own it, right?
am i the only one who doesn't care about modularity in a laptop?
But is the GPU upgradeable? LOL
Does anyone else prefer the thicker laptop designs?
Amazing only issue with this is why are they stuck with intel where is the customizability i need AMD CPU and RTX GPU
Can u game on it tho
Can you game on this thing?
Can they do this to phones next?
No dedicated GPU?
I wondered when you'd cover this new hardware!  It sounds so cool!
Linus can i ask if you mind adjusting some sfx on your videos ? A loud pure tone beep at 11:54 is quite discomfort for my ear which has a sound sensitive disorder ( i have hearing damage) , thank you and really appreciate if you can do it.
Someone : - What if we introduce OOPs to hardware?  Framework: -   Hold my beer :)
So this is the first laptop who's target audience is mainly repair shops?
Very cool, think it can run some games?
can I upgrade the gpu?
So can I upgrade from x86 to arm in the future?
Is that Alex from mystery tech
No cap, I think that if this isn't a direct replacement to all laptops, I don't know what this is
Wheres Anthony ? we need new vid about budget pc's
Why only Intel tho? Seems like a poor choice to me.
But why do you wear earrings?  So weird.
OK IT UPGRADES, BUT WILL IT BLEND? THAT IS THE QUESTION.
Gaming stress result?
Anyone know what sort of battery life this would get in either gaming or general tasks?
Is running my laptop plugged in the wall all the time actually ruins the battery ?? @16:41
What about graphics card? It what most laptop users want to be upgradable. Would be cool if they had modules to change cpu and gpu.
Which USB 3.2? I need the reference chart
Can it run Linux tho?
How well does it support Linux?
Ok let's talk about the price?
What is the price comparison with a non-modular similarly specc'd lappy?
ever heard of ThinkPad laptops?
Why another dude in the room wearing a mаsk? Is he l000ney?
1:58 Do u still use that note 9?
What was that little black thing inserted into the side of the laptop
in principle, could two usb-A ports fit in a single one of these square plugins?
But, is the graphics card upgradable?
does it take a sim card?
Only 5 screws to remove the bottom? My old Clevo laptop, no screws needed, just slide the lock button and push it back for full access to cooler, motherboard, ram and whatever :)  EDIT: Hope in the future they make something bigger and actually customizable like Clevo did where we can choose the CPU, GPU, screen... For now not even having an actual GPU other than iGPU I would never buy such thing, not that I would actually buy a laptop nowadays, I'd rather stick with Desktop + smartphone and maybe something like the upcoming Steamdeck to play something on-the-go as I don't play android crapware...
Do people actually use trac pads by choice?
Was that episode sponsored by Framework ?
What's the brand of this laptop? And where can I purchase it? Does it have a website?
Are there any plans to offer 17 inch versions?
can it play vr  games ??
What about GPU?
Neat!  Where's the discrete GPU module?
does linus actually cook in this kitchen
how about graphics card upgrade
Would they provide solder stencils? Especially for parts prone to breaking.
Can you please download addblock for chrome  so you don't need to blur advertisement )
How can this be made available in India ? I was drooling the moment I heard that it's a modular laptop.
I wonder how many of these would Steve Wozniak buy
Wait how does it perform for gaming? I’m curious if I should go for the Framework laptop for the Acer Nitro 5.
8:17 is it really even an LTT video if Linus DOESN'T drop something at this point?
Sword art online laptop???
Is ther gaming capabilities on this laptop ?
in the Kitchen??😵
0:30 Anyone else get a nerdy woody for those clear key caps?
No graphics card options?  Can it game at all?
Upgradeable laptop, yet still uses a sealed battery?   WHY??????????
The second-hand weight pertinently mark because church pertinently ask forenenst a efficacious bat. unhealthy, happy particle
why are they so obsessed with making thin laptops? can i get a half inch thick boy with more functionality?
Where can I buy this?
Does it support external GPU on 3.2 with these connectors? Would be my go-to laptop but I wish they had Ryzen Mobile chips.
Can we appreciate the amount of plain cardboard and lack of plastic packages too?
Hey @LinusSebastian, where did you get that cap you're wearing? I want one.
Has anyone tried running any linux distros on this? I'm still traumatised by some OEMs (looking at you Sony...) whose system could not run ubuntu for example without a ton of pre-flight grub commands.
can you game on this laptop?
Is there an amd option/dedicated gpu option?
What's the word on a GPU within the laptop? For this expense, it would be cool if we could get something better than Xe graphics on a laptop
but what about a graphics card?
Hey, how about the graphics card ? Are they replaceable too ?
Does it run windows or linux ?
Could... could this be the beginning of a truly universal laptop form factor?
Was just me nervous about the way Linus holds the laptop?
They didnt include a blank connector? For someone who is building a business laptop where he doesnt want anyone randomly connecting thier flash drives lol
The school I work for orders new laptops every year, I may have to start pulling some strings and asking around.
You guys coming to India anytime soon? Need one of these.
Doesnt look like this has a modular graphics card.  It would be nice if it did, even an external one for high end gamers or video editing.  You can just undock when you dont need it.
Did I miss the part where there's a graphics card?
God, why didnt I know about this before I went ahead and spent way too much for my work laptop. I'm seriously considering on retuning it now.
But what are the Graphics Chipset?
Here is my one question:  Can it accept an external graphics card? Or does the USB 3.2 spec not support that?
I’m very excited with this laptop bc I’m looking to buy one to replace my MacBook Air. Now, could you please call the big guy and assess if this laptop works with Ubuntu or any other Linux distro? Many thanks, Jonathan.
Could this be a Hackintosh’ers mobile wet dream?
What are the gpu options?
What about ESD while playing with it
Wait don’t Clevo / Sagers have CPU’s that aren’t soldered?
What about GPU ?
Two quick questions: 1: Will windows still be valid if/when  you upgrade the motherboard/change the hardware spec? 2: whats the graphics set up and upgrade options in the future?
Why do you want a touchscreen on a laptop? I could see if it were a convertible or 2-in-1...
When did Jake Paul start doing tech reviews???
But does it have a gpu? Can we game on it?
So the modules swap out with just USB 3.2? So in theory I could switch that second drive between computers if the laptop breaks?
Excuse ME? Where´s Linus? Did I miss something? This is muscular Linus!!! :D 😍
No optical drive bay in a tower, no dice.  As for the laptop, is the GPU upgradeable or replaceable?
Wasn’t there like 20 of those modular innovative companies that promise so much and their amazing support and how one device will last? Even recent modular Motorola phone.   Idea is great but main offenders which are graphics card and cpu are soldered to board. I hope it stays and works out this time but a bit sceptic
Why didn't you show this 2 months ago when I was buying a new laptop? CURSE YOU!
It this video cut by a new member of the team? This new effects, this not 100% correct blur into the sponsor at 17:49...
NileRed spotted?
I skeptical that their manufacturing process is scalable to the level of Dell or Apple.
At 03m00s - Ex-engineers? Did they suddenly forget how to engineer? =:oO [LOOKS AT THE PRODUCT] Well, clearly not!  Oh, you mean "Engineers who used to work for..." $LIST_OF_COMPANIES".  =:o}
was wondering why my desktop was heating up while watching this vid
wonder how upgradable the graphics are. I didn't see anything about that. with a desktop i can change out the video card making it last longer because the gpu upgrades are generally more important then the cpu upgrades to game performance in most instances. if the gpu is integrated into the MB then you basically have to buy a new MB each time.
What does the graphics situation look like? _pun intended_
ffs could u put any more links in the comments
What is the ceiling treatment https://youtu.be/0rkTgPt3M4k?t=906 at 17:53
Didn't G.SKILL buy the segway?
What if they put the CPU on its own separate modular board so you could just buy a new one and slot it in?
You bought the segway to your sponsor or your sponsor bought/paid for the time to advertise on your platform? 🤣
What about the performance?
Incredible product, however, what about the GPU?
VERY cool laptop!!! , but WHERE IS RyZen CPUs?? Where is MXM GPU option? Fixed in next gen?
On application: "How did you find out about our job opportunities? "  Answer: I got the link off of a sticker on my motherboard.
Can i ask could dell lattiude 5000 series its a touch screen and slot in desktop gpu?
What if they had a larger model with a dGPU that was possible to upgrade too? They would dominate that market segment.
So can i run linux on this and not have any issues?
Are the modules hot swappable?
does it come with tpm?
But more importantly, can I install a new GPU easily?
But can it run Crysis
Can you do some performance tests? so I know what I would expect out of the hardware. Look great tho
what about thermal performance?
Can you play video games on it?
Will there be 3rd party modules? Otherwise we are stuck with the company ones...
Is it coming with linux, at least as an option to install it by manufacturer?  Fist, before id buy: They have to ship to the Netherlands. AMD, and full linux support (although, when you said power button and fingerprint reader comes with full linux support, iwas already wow, like it!), but that RISC-V option really a sweet option what would be lovely to have and play with!
Why is the douchie kid wearing a mask? I guess he buys into the Big Pharma perpetuated lies? Please investigate!
Hmmmm.... dongles... but inside..... they would never notice that
Where can I buy this shit ?
Am I the only one that thinks this is dumb? I’m fine with using an external USB-C dongle. Instead of one that’s flush with the computer. Just unnecessary  To be clear, I’m talking about the big selling point of “modularity” or the laptop, especially the ports. The repairability I think is great
Whats the graphics card specs ??
I cannot find the cad drawing, someone that have found it?
Can you advise, my laptop is a Dell i7 5559 with ddr3l 8gb (4X2), I want to upgrade to 16gb(8X2), in Sri Lanka AITC is available at a reasonable price, how is this brand do you have experience in using this brand,
this pos has no graphics card options ,$1600 aud for the cheaper option with 8 gb ram,?? cpu upgrades ????  .. sounds like a scam to me
This company reminds me of discord
Where can I invest? This needs to go viral.
Still deep fake Linus what's this   I know that by u never dropped stuff I need linus
Wait… So, I don't have to be stuck with this loose/broken USB port anymore? I can just buy a new module and swap it out? Sign me up, quickly!
Why is it so hard to tell whether hes praising or sarcastically belittling something? 😂😂
As for wireless charging, it it truly wireless charging if the modular part is not wireless? Is it not just a part of the charger that is wireless :P This probably will not stand in court though.
What about the graphics card?
For those wondering about the price: $749 lowest model with empty expansion slots and no OS. Mid level is about $1500. All the bells and whistles around $2000. Plus tax.
In the NVMe slot, does it look like there's enough clearance for an SN850 with a heatsink?
Where is the GPU?
did it come with a windows license?
I am pumped. I may have missed it, what OS does it ship with? Does it support all OS's?
Can you upgrade the cpu?? that is the big question.
How well does it Linux is what I wanna know...
Completely?  Am I missing something more than just modular ports?  I think that a full complements of ports built in at the start would be cheaper and more effective path.  (Need to modify a port in the future?  Buy a dongle.  But since laptops are typically replaced more often than desktops, I suspect that few would need to do that.)
Hey can we upgrade the graphics card in this one?
@Framework Are there Linux drivers for all the components?  Specifically power button / fingerprint reader has me worried. E. G. On my HP EliteBook 840 G3 I've got an unusable fingerprint reader - no drivers for Linux available - and even if i wanted to write one myself, the company making them does not hand out specs needed to make a driver so you literally have to reverse engineer the entire device...
Would this be linus's daily driver?
Is the chasis all aluminium?
Me who's wondering if I could get a job with them   Also me being a literal child
Actually how much does it cost
This, gentlemen of honour is the electronics equivalent of a transformation from " Don't drink the contents of the battery" to "How to adjust the valve clearance of your new 'whatever model car you just bought'."
i can see that it comes included with Iris Xe Graphics card, but hard to find info on how good that is, can you comment on the gaming ability of this laptop?
You can’t change the graphics card ?
When time comes that the display or motherboard will be broken, can we buy those individual parts? There would also be a time that we might want to buy only the expansions. Hope soon, there will be a way to upgrade the mobo/proc
Lol @530 wasn't the prototype stolen when it was shown off or was that the triple screen labtop that went "Missing"
what graphic card does it use? and does the graphic card upgradeable too?
_But how are we supposed to sell our repair plans if the end user can just repair it themselves?!_
but do microcenter got that framework laptops tho? i think not!
is it only me that likes bulky and chunkier laptop.. imagine it is upgradable u can push so much higher spec on the chunkier one.
Anyone eyeing this and wondering if it could be a Thinkpad/MacBook killer?
I doubt that Disconnect Battery was for using it that way though. Isn't it a service option that disconnects the battery for service, and until you plug in AC adapter?
What the frick is that mechanical keyboard
no GPU tho?
8:21 Can you change this slots while the laptop is running? Or do you need to restart for it to realize it's now a HDMI and not an USB-A anymore?
Love to know what Louis Rossmann
Question: Isn't this what Project Ara was supposed to be but for phones? Anyone know why did it fail? And how much chance is there of Framework succeeding? I'd love for them to gain traction and start selling their products in my country as well
Why would anyone downvote that video?
The expansion 'cards' that plug into the USB C ports seem to be wide enough for 2 USB A ports - I'm surprised they only went with 1.
12:30 where?
It's a great idea but sounds like it's just made to break... No?
Am I just weird? I have a Lenovo legion 5 and I like that is a little thicker and heavier than what people seem to want (not redicoulasly so though)  and I can open it one handed haha
What if just make a removable on-board CPU that can be remove from the motherboard?
I dont get why the cpu isn't upgradable. I've had laptop workstations with upgradable cpus and gpus. Those were the only laptops I bought, so I was suprised by the soldered in CPUs of other laptops when I wanted someting smaller. My dell precision 2014 (replaced 2018), still had the same chasis as the 2010 model (I don't think later models were truly fully upgradable) Linus is pretty accurate when he cites that time with the begining the end of fully upgradable laptops.
Which laptop manufacturers are doing the chassi intrusion thing? Havent run across it yet
does it support a graphics card ?
Is this heaven ?🤔
we've tried this with phones. Remember Project ARA? Although I hope modular will be the future for everything because of e-waste and everything...but how is this different than Project ARA?
So only integrated graphics for the time being?
can you uninstall the bios?
Does it has dedicated gpu?
How about cpu/gpu? Are they replaceble?
It's awesome! Do they have Italian keyboard layout and do they ship to Italy?
Can it run Windows 11 ?
Since the cpu is soldered to the motherboard, will it be difficult for them to sell just those motherboard+cpu that fit into the casing?
PROB WITH QR CODES IS THIS WILL FADE DO TO HEAT AND USE   SO YA A PAPER BOOK IS BETTER
What happened to the modular phone we heard a long time ago?
Why does he treat this new laptop like a bag of potatoes?
Why does he still use a note 9
who gonna use this thing, i bet that even those guy's will not ?
Wait, the specs for this laptop are actually insane for the price...
Can we replace all part of dell laptops?
do we know if they are going to have laptop GPUs for this/are they going to be upgradeable?
But can it run crysis?
can we upgrade for dedicated gpus!?
what did linus do to his phone?
What about Graphic card? Does it have M.2 expansion slots?
We just gonna ignore the fact that it's got no dedicated GPU?
One nitpick about the usb modules is the fact those only hold one usb c port where I see 2 fitting. Probably not too hard to make one with 2 ports.
I love the idea but do you think they would be able to add a integrated gpu to it? It would be nice to see a customizable gaming laptop
But what about gaming? I game on the go (I travel a lot) so I tend to prefer a pseudo-desktop replacement laptop with discrete graphics. It doesn't sound like the Framework has an option for that (yet?).
Wasn't there a cell phone manufacturer which developed a modular phone where the innards like modem, storage, phone, speaker, etc., were independently upgradeable?  Consumer reception was ice cold.
Begs the question: are there limitations to the amount of same type of module? As in, can you plug in 4x HDMI modules, and does it actually work with all 4 at the same time?
Hmmm...🤔 I wonder where the dislikes are coming from.
what about one where you can slide your phone in? with models that support "desktop" mode?
You can't switch out GPU and CPU so what the hell is the point? By the time my laptop screen and ports starts not working right, it'll be time to land fill the system and get a new one so I don't see the value of only making irrelevant parts modular while leaving the heart and brain of the system unchangeable.
Who would want a product like this tho?
The whole laptop flexing thing is a terrible argument anyway. My Dell G3 is way thicker and heavier than that thing, yet flexes over twice as much because the build quality is shit.  And as much as I hate Apple, I would say their MacBooks are the gold standard for build quality, just because you can't really flex a _solid fucking aluminum chassis_
Is the free pair of headphones in the description a scam?
Why wouldn’t you boot to a 1tb? I like my 980 pro1tb and even the 980 1tb is good too
Graphics card?
Could i plug my RTX 3060 into this and play games of it???
Microphone switch? Heh. That can't beat my wifi switch on my lenovo g560 from 2010.
No GPU on this thing?
did you buy, or sell the segway to the sponsor?
Can it run games though???
Is there an RTX 3090 plug in module? :P
It's repairability through modularity. The question is can you swap out a basic chip on that motherboard without it disabling itself. I bet that you can.
11:34 Why does he hate on Adele? :c
I love this idea and i've been following them for a while, but my issue is... will this company exist in 5 - 10 years time?
Why did the editor do Alex so dirty like that....
Wait wait so with this laptop that we saw in this video, I can upgrade my GPU AND CPU? Which is not possible in any other laptop so far in this world?
Is there an option for a framework Windows 11 where you can decide how you want your taskbar?
Props to Framework. Great product construct, but totally random: would they ever invest in a modular gaming/workstation variant of the Framework laptops?
How come you don't do videos on dildos. They're tech too...
Need smaller battery and 2,5“ case and a german keyboard?!
What about software? Is the firmware open source?
But could I buy just a new motherboard to put into my still-funcioning frame?
uh oh and reading their site, Arduino compatible port????
For the GPU, i dont think they will sell it as different pieces as the mainboard. And do intel & AMD still sell socketed laptop cpu?  if gaming is ur things, i believe that Steam Deck + Portable Monitor way more affordable for portability.   799 for laptop that has ability to be relieble for few years, not much tho.
Now will this run Windows 11?  I could use this!!!
Watching Linux install the SODIMMs, which have little snapping hold-downs... Why don't M.2 ports have that? They could be placed at the end for long M.2 cards, or could be placed at the sides, so they'd work for both long and short cards.
What about gpu?
How to fard?
What happend to the GPU?
And it comes in a plain recycleable cardboard box?!?!
sitting here with my thinkpad t430 thinking if we were forgotten.
Hi, this seems like it's going to be my next laptop. But one thing I didn't fully understand is, do their upgrade modules all use TB3? If so, are they single or dual PCIE Express lanes? Basically I am curious whether the laptop could support an eGPU?
With so many upgradable parts, being able to replace the whole thing, isn't it gonna be like the Ship of Theseus?
Anyone want a balance audio plug extension card?
OK where is the graphic card
Awesome! What about gaming performance?
Do they plan to do a gaming version?
Huh, isn't the ports actually USB4 because it has 40Gbps of bandwidth
For the magnetic connector since it's just a type C could a volta cable work?
Did anyone else notice the damage on Linus's phone?
But could you add an eGPU or USB-C Video enclosure to game with it?  Just curious if it could handle 4K gaming on a big monitor?
what about graphics
Can we take a moment to appreciate how DavidTennantDoctor-ly he reacts when he first sees the laptop?
Why would you unbox a laptop in the kitchen? *Confused*
ehh I mean idk if I gotta drop 1400 for worse performance than a m1 MacBook air for 900...not sure I would get 500 dollars worth of value getting a few more years out of it with worse performance. Cool idea ,but cannot see myself buying this first gen version at this price
1) Is this marketed for business or for home consumers? Clearly not business.
2) how about you do the same tests like you would with any other laptop manufacturer? Keyboard flex and lifting the lid with one hand?
Wonder if it's possible to add a gpu in the future!?
Nobody else thinks that needing to get a USB-C  pass through to just charge the device is kinda dumb? And it takes up one of your ports… just make the internal header replaceable/make a small power only “dongle” slot, to keep it replaceable without taking up space.
When are they going to do this with cars?
These guys need to pair up with Sensel.  Linus, why aren't you showing Ubuntu running on it?  Come on man!!
USB-C is only OK. Until the connector on the laptop breaks due to wear/tear...abuse? I have been seeing many laptops at work where the USB-C connector failed.
Does it have a separate GPU? .
11:55 WTF is that?  Don’t put that in the videos.  That noise is awful 😣
16:17 Wait, that's not a standard thing??? Wow companies are jerks
to me that doesnt count as a laptop with every mod possible im wondering when they will have some sort of computer it doesnt matter if its a laptop or desktop Ive always wanted to see a computer with all the ports...
Can they make a cell phone too? Please
Are they going to add graphics cards? Because as an engineer working with 3d software id definitely prefer that option
$1000 for integrated intel graphocs? That is not affordable.
So usb dongles are “replaceable connectors” now?
Isn’t all of this Linux real state?
this reminded my of the phoneblocks thing, what happened to that?
do they deliver schematics for diagnostics?  Schematics or die! ~Louis Rossmann's cat
i wanted to order one, but there is no options for black keyboard faceplate and eu charger. I also wonder can we use external gpu ?
they should have made the slots a bit wider so they fit 2x USB-A on them.
Domo Arigato's name is covered by suggested videos (on mobile at least)     Edit: you think I got the name right the first time???????
Ask Steve about Dell, you'll get looong sigh.
Why are you so clumsy.
how good is the keyboard for writing?
can you get one with a touch screen
Dunno WTF is wrong with their website, but it reloads while selecting expansion cards and makes you redo the entire configuration over and over
Weird that they went for i7's  with no GPU option seems like i3-i5 would make more sense.
will windows start crying for activation once Motherboards and CPUs are upgradable?
Those bottom lips are for the vent on the bottom and wtf are the specs and other io's. You didn't say if the gpu was upgradable i have so many questions
Is the GPU upgradable?
I am just a bit curious about the tpm situation of this laptop. with windows 11 requiring it as a default setup what happens when you replace any system module?
Is it OK to say displayport or displayport port?
Can you swap out the GPU?
Can you try out some Linux distro on it? You mentioned that the power button/fingerprint sensor has Linux drivers so I'm assuming good things.
12:45 linux drivers for fingerprint sensor ?  Where is the referal link? I need this. If it only would have ryzen 5x cpu....
So because of the TPM requirement on Windows 11 do you think the modular design would cause issues? Because it's tied to the hardware right? I hope not because this thing is so So SO SO! Cool!!!
I am not Technically savvy but do these plug in components open up a whole new world for plug in destructive hacker components that are a one time hit and run ?
What happens when you need more ports at one time than is available  back to a dongle now if they just provided a dongle that magnetically stuck to the back of the machine or actually plugged into one of the ports. Laptops spent 99% of their life sitting on a desk or in a bag anyway.
Is the website down for maintenance for anyone else?
Can we please have a ARM version of this please?
Only complaint is there is no ethernet slot
Is it just me or I can't seem to order this because the website keeps giving me an error message....
Do they also offer matte display?
Wait your battery can swell if you use your laptop, while on charge... Um
Cost for device and modules?
How much is it????????
Y’know I kind of wonder if a gpu as one of those little modular chips is possible
Do those external GPUs work with this thing??
Aren't those standalone GPU thingy also uses thunderbolt? Doesn't that mean one could also hook it up to it, basically gaining a a good gaming experience at home, the flexibility of a laptop, and the modularity of a PC, all in one high potential package?  I hope they reach Asia. I'm buying as soon as they ship to my place.
Wait is has power pass through?! How is this not a standard?! I've been asking for this for years! So many of my old equipments can be turned into security cams, emulation stations, and other random smart functions had this been an easy work.
Hello dear, can you please review the Xiaomi Notebook Pro X 15 - i7 11370H - 32GB/1TB - OLED? Is it really a flagship killer?
Why does this laptop remind me of my current gaming laptop? Its nearly the same thickness with (I think) replacable cpu, nvme drive, and ram. No clue about the GPU.
But why not mention the graphics card at all? I can't be the only one wondering if it can game, can I?
Wonder if they'd do a small form factor desktop that uses the same main board, but supports PCIe GPU boards,.. use the laptop mainboard like the NUC compute module.
Can you get Anthony to install Linux on it and run some tests? :D
Impressive, but can it run crysis?
We got some Project Ara type shinanigans going on here?
how about germany guys?
I wonder if GNU/Linux will run without issues on it and that all the modules work without issue?
But what's the point if you can't upgrade the cpu? That's the main reason people upgrade their pcs.
Question is… can you use the screen as a stand alone display for other devices. For example, Xbox/playstation to hdmi INPUT on the laptop to use screen as a display.
@12:50 1single iFixitbit of Kolmogorov Complexity?!
im gonna wait till they allow customizable graphic cards
No graphics card? why wanna upgrade motherboard or cpu for internet browser laptop....?
what about the gpu?
I've never liked laptops in all honesty, mostly due to repairing them and the fact you can't really customize them. But after seeing this, I might actually consider it. All though, one question, where are the letters/ numbers etc on the keyboard?
Why would they want the bigger manufacturers to hop on that modular train? If it's that good give Framework their props and push their product.
Can we get the ultimate framework laptop
Can I upgrade my CPU later? Yes! If you ever need more performance in the future, you can upgrade to a new Mainboard with a new CPU on it. We publish step by step guides you can follow to do the upgrade yourself.
I need some advice. Looking into saving up for my very first PC. I wanna do it right and build it myself. Which of Linus's videos would be the most helpful for me? I'm coming from a zero knowledge background, only ever owned laptops with enough power to get me through my uni assignments.
Can it play warzone?
I thought Linus already did a review on this? Or was that someone else? It was a few months ago I think…
Magnetic Type-C cables: Am i a joke to you?
I have a question.. If you remove a module, can you plug a USB C device directly into the port the module normally plugs into?  If you can, this is really great for people like me who do a lot of work with the laptop on the move (programming radios) and the cable is plugged in out of the way and protected from being broken off..
How do I invest in this company? Might as well make bank when the big manufacturers buy this company and kill the product...
What do pc gamers and laptop gamers share? They both hate laptop gaming.
Is the cameraman drunk?
why make things fixable when you can force them to pay alot to get it repaired do to a flawed design and force them into feeling like the only easy option is buy a new one., companies these days expanding on annoyances for more cash
Which specific version of USB 3.2 is used to connect the modular I/O to the mainboard?
The I/O is my biggest complaint about this... There's 4 slots for expansion but all of them are single. So like... the USB-C port is a single one and so you're really just going from the embedded one to one that's on the edge and paying $9 for that privilege. Why can't they fit in two in that same expansion size? Or even better, have a USB-C port that's there without having to add an expansion module to get it?  And why no Thunderbolt? They're using an Intel processor so Thunderbolt is available and they can just charge a little extra for the expansion module to pay for the licensing. I like the idea and it's much more doable than the module phones that people keep trying. It just needs some more built-in stuff to make it more worth it. And some additional expansion cards too. LAN, VGA, Serial...
What about gpu? In their website, I wasn't able to find anything about gpu.
Does this thing not have activated Windows included?
If its so well documented, why not fully disassemble the laptop and then give it to Sarah to re-assemble.   Or give a laptop to Sarah and tell her to upgrade it.
I don't understand, how is that CPU and GPU are weld to the motherboard in laptops?
its cool but can it run windows 11
Surely that's the best webcam of any laptop on sale today?
Great but where's the trackpoint?
actually looks worth buying, just gotta wait till its in NZ is the issue
Can't you just buy a magnetic charger adapter for usb c?
I feel like they could have maybe added another port to the USB-C module
What’s the display hertz? Cannot find it on the website.
wait ... what was the drawback??
Can I run an external GPU using those thunderbolt interfaces?  I'd definitely get one when touchpad is an option.
How to attach a gpu to it
Would this have the special security for windows 11?
I want to buy one. Is it available in India?
How is the cabled earbuds debate still a thing? It’s like using DVD instead of streaming…
Do those usb-c modules support TB4 tho? That would be a dealbreaker for me!
Is there a way to modify it so it becomes a 2in1? Maybe that could be a great follow-up video :)
Should I upgrade my Rtx 2060 super to a 3070?
How expensive is it?
would love to see the chonker version of this design or idk, maybe by the time i'm upgrading my laptop in idk, 5 more years? (got mine in 2019, acer nitro5) chonker laptop is a thing of the past and you won't ever need a chonker laptop for any particular reason
*But...* Does it game?
Anyone knows when they will start shipping to Europe?
Why hasn't Louis Rossman commented yet? 🤔
Still figuring out if they spelt “upgradeable” wrong or right
Did y'all DDOS their site trying to buy one. I can't get onto it lol
do they do world wide sales and service ?
I wonder if @rossmangroup has seen this? Looks like something he'd be interested in.
if this is a dream, don’t wake me up!
15:09  How u doing.... 😅
What about graphic cards? I want a swapable gfx 😂😂
Linus can you do a video on how much can a  HP EliteBook 2560p Laptop can be upgraded to ....
LOVE this idea, but should they make a gaming version?🤔
So what’s the difference between this and all the other modular laptops that came before and failed? I’d love for it to succeed but I don’t think enough people actually care.
can you take a dongle and connect it all?
But how many poeple will actually use these features?
Almost perfect, but, if this is so configurable so why they don't have a Ryzen? To be honest Intel XE still not best choice comparable to VEGA 8. So, it would be nice to have Ryzen motherboard.
Why am i not surprised at all that Linux's phone looks like it was dropped?
It's been something like 5 years since i started tinkering with old thinkpad because of their upgradability and robustness, but right now, i'm really asking to myself if my next laptop still will be and thinkpad ! Like, i've got a T430 right now, which is the far end of upgradable cpu on laptop, and it's kina old right now. The only thing which slow me down is the lack of trackpoint (yeah in thinkpad user true fashion ^^) !
Was there any word about the GPU in that thing or did I just miss it?
Are the publicly traded?
I am confused between asus zephyrus g15 and lenovo legion 5 pro (dolby vision display current in sale in india). which one should i buy please help me...... PLEASE HELP ME I AM CONFUSED!!!
Why do YouTube thumbnails tend to have someone making an exaggerated goofball expression?
Wait, you mean to tell me Microsoft and Apple have patents for putting a magnet in a hole that your charger goes into? You can fuck right off microapple.
Can it run Crysis?
17:15 Activate Windows?!
Does it work with linux ? anyone tried Ubuntu ?
How good is the Os install, bloatware wise? I imagine they aren't overloading it with nonsense and pointless software.
Can you use linux on this laptop?
I wonder if it has a i3 version for in-budget consumers
Is that IKEA laptop? :)
There is a feature on my laptop where it starts up automatically when I open it, is this feature available in the bios as well?
Does he mean modular
Why your phone is busted tho? @LinusTechTips
Literally the owner of LTT (and family), Linus has his phone broken?? (or I am seeing things)
Could I do light gaming on this? I’m talking low settings destiny 2, terraria, Minecraft and maybe gmod
Is the CPU socketed?
I just wish there was an option for Ryzen CPU's and maybe a 5mm thicker version for GPU's, more interchangable slots, more PCIe slots, etc.. like 2 versions
What happened to KFC console 🤔😕
Can you send me one pls?
DO they ship worldwide? I finally found a laptop I want to buy.
Can you have Anthony install Linux on it?
how many watts is the CPU configured to run at? edit: nevermind its 28w continuous.
If Linus likes it enough to daily drive it, can we get a long term review of this? I would love to recommend this to friends and family if I have the peace of mind that the laptop is durable.
Is this basically the laptop version of Phonebloks?
I thought this thing allows you to change cpu and graphics card…
looks like the diy edition of the base model costs $107 MORE then the prebuilt base model with the same parts.......
Next up, the Framework gaming laptop? I may end up buying one despite the lack of a GPU.
the websites configurator doesn't work rn so i cant order one. :( how many of the 1million that watched this video in 24hrs since upload bought one?  they probably got absolutely flooded with ordered and disabled the configurator.
Hope they don't charge too much for modules
Why is the display refresh rate a secret????
But can it run Apple OS? We need you to Hackintosh it!
No egpu test? What 2as the point of watching this.
i like what i see on this laptop, but i do wonder about the 'wasted horizontal space' on modules why only 1xUSB-A in module where it can fit 2xUSB-A next to each other  (USB-A 3.1 can fit 2 at USB-C 3.2) the lack of USB 4 may prevent o put e.g. 2x HDMI, 2x DP or combined 1x HDMI 1x DP into single module about display, i agree it needs touchscreen with better IPS/OLED/IGZO type (10bit,HDR, 75-240Hz) also this type of modules isn't unheard of (similar to some of the hardened rugged enterprise ones)
Was that zoom on his face NOT slightly to close? Wouldn't your brain screen at you "whoops, slightly to far"? Hmm... Maybe that's the point.
what kind colorful desk pad do you use? where i can buy it?
The main issue with this type of laptop is the adoption rate and support. Will the company still be around to support upgradeable modular parts especially for the CPU/motherboard component if I were to upgrade it 2~3 years or even 5 years down the road? Without third party support, you can only hope that the company may still be around or continue to make new and replaceable modular parts to prolong their support for this laptop.
The best question is, will it run windows 11?
Does anyone know what the screensaver/video at 00:19 is ? I've always seen it but don't know anything about it. Cheers
its a nice thought but a 750 dollar laptop with no graphics card and only offering an intel chip with it?  it seems very gimmicky.  this video seems more like a baised review, barely put any emphasis on the flaws and noting minimal stupid things to play down the short comings.    can't upgrade the processor, no option for dedicated graphics card.  those are the upgrades that extend the life.  i don't see a point in purchasing this at this price point with its capabilities.
or for the magnetic, ya could get some of those USB c magnetic adapters and just slot those into the default module and cord Idk just an idea.
Haven't you people bought the Asus Rog strix scar 17 ? If not then why? Please make a video on it please LTT.
How do you manage to misspell upgradable  Seems to be a correct spelling, just not one I have ever seen before. Also it looks gross
I wondered that was a sponsor, a gorgeous one
Where can I get one?
Fingerprint good on linux, what about everything else? Anthony, please answer me! :-D I might be keen.
does it have TPM 2.0 thou?
Am I crazy or that's like top ten webcam of all laptop market?
A Segway to the sponsor?  Do they still make those? Maybe bicycle?
What can it handle game wise?
Is it available in India???? I really want it. If anyone knows something please tell🙏🏻
Does this have a eGPU support ? 😄 Edit: I saw this video like 9hrs ago and I remember to ask question now 😵‍💫 😂😂😂
Linus what anime do you watch if you do.
Modular gaming laptop framework?🤞
I’m trying to save for a pc can u give me tips for best parts for a “good” pc for under $800
Flimsy? My "2010" notebook is a solid brick, so solid I can probably throw it and break someone bone. big and ugly, I can agree, however... Flimsy?
Can this Framework work with Ryzen since it relies on Thunderbolt?
Hey Linus, are there any windows laptops you'd recommend for a budget as tight as.. $50 😐.
Can you game on it?
Why does this feel fake 🤔
$750 affordable??? Maybe if they have a $350 model variant
So, do we think they'll upgrade the motherboard with similar dimensions? Easily upgrade without setting a whole chassis to waste.
why does this whole video feel like an ad
what is your fav anime linus ?
you know how other laptop let you physically upgrade the wireless chip, how many times have you not been able to boot after cause the chip you used is not white listed in the things BIOS
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO where the benchmarking and stress testing???????????????????????????????????????????????
No AMD  apu options?
I mean that’s what I don’t understand about right to repair movement. They keep saying it’s about having a option not about forcing people, but then why confront companies for being anti right to repair? If the movement demands change to companies that doesn’t support repairability in their view, how is that not forcing people to repair things by their hands?
how do i do a preorder on the web? it seems like the web for framework has issues
But can it game tho?
But does it play Doom
I like it I really do but isn't this like toughbook 5.0 or whatever it is I understand the tough book is in a different class but they basically offer for the most part the same modularity I know they still offer CD-ROM LOL but I can get behind this
My brother really want to switch his laptop but he's a graphic designer. Is Iris Xe Graphics have any issue to run adobe illustrator?
Does this have thunderbolt capability? Just curious if I can plug it into an external gpu
is it your daily driver???
If someone wanted a magnetic charger why not use the Volta cable since the charger is modular?
Accessibility and documentation are sweet, but these hot-swap USB-C module things seem a bit over engineered. One USB-A and USB-C on each side would be plenty flexible and leave should leave enough room on the inside for a full size M.2 slot for Storage/5g.
I need help Linus or anybody out there with pc experience I have a problem with my screen flickering and I can't access anything ok launch in safe mode reset pc nope black screen ok then troubleshoot from sign in unable to repair and I can't update my drivers to fix my flickering screen what do I do I haven't tried anything else and I'm thinking about buying a windows 10 USB drive and downloading it
Linus watches anime???
I didn't hear any mention of a upgradable gpu???  That's the main thing I would want to swap out
Do monkeys press NEXT?
How does it perform with Gaming or Productivity (photoshop/music production)?
11:53 What the hell was that?
Linus likes anime did I hear that correctly??
waiting for them to figure out how to made mobile CPU and GPU swappable... not sure if it's doable since CPU and GPU upgrade also means the cooling system need to be upgradable to match...
Absolutely love it and everything it is trying to achieve but I honestly wonder if the average laptop buyer actually wants to go tinking around in their device?
Is there a ChromeOS/ChromiumOS certified version?
How many of us have built our own desktop? Lots of people who watch Linus, and we also might like to tinker with our laptop.
16:18 don't laptop's do this automatically when they're plugged in?
linus no! what happened to your note 9!
Are you ever gonna do an msrp gpu give away because I have been waiting months and can't get one
Customizable? Is that legal in this day and age?
Is it possible for laptop to have kind of PCIe slot outside so you can actually use full speed GPU outside? Or it's just impossible because of technical reason?
will we see him drop that laptop ???
Damn.. when is this coming to Brazil?
Magnetic charging?  Volta, maybe?
alright can it run acrh crysis mincraft?
Was anyone else super nervous with the way linus was waving that damn thing about one handed?
how did msft and apple trademark the mag safe stuff? with your one sponsor that makes the mag safe  phone chargers???
Linus does is this compatible with usb4 spec? Including pcie 4. I know there might be reason you can't say thunderbolt outright
Unfortunately, the configure part of the website is down. Is big tech  going to allow a product like this to thrive? doubtful. But I plan on buying one if possible.
How do right to repair an Apple Watch I don’t want this movement fucking up design
Ok but where do i put the gpu?
I wonder how this would work with something like the Razer Core for external GPU's
Can we get a AMD 5800U version of this laptop?
These are way to affordable and good. What is the catch?
is there or will there be a version with dedicated graphics card tho?
I’m in love with this laptop thinking about getting it In the near future do you think this would be a good laptop for tuning cars the programs used for that can be pretty large
the question  is can it run Crysis lol
Do you think we can use this as a gaming RIG, with thunderbolt and a external GPU BOX, like 3060 ti?
How about reviews of some toasters? As a gamer I don't know what toaster to buy!
Their website is a little buggy. Keeps giving me errors. Did we hug it to death?
here's a fun question when was the last time toshiba did anything interesting? that's what i thought
Graphic card?
tbh I don't see how they're going to be profitable. If third parties start making those expansion slots, likely cheaper than frameworks own, how do they maintain revenue? Are they going to sell me a new motherboard every couple of years? Is it even worth buying *almost* a whole new system? or should I just buy a while new system?
is it werid that im getting my RAM, Monitors, And Powersupply from a book store?
Anyone else unable to configure? It keeps crashing on me *sigh*
why are yall still wearing masks?
Ok, but am I going to see you USING IT from now on?
Whats with the pops and clicks?
People don't even "like" to install their own "OS" so why!?
why are these videos so low on brightness?
Can you make a video about desktop GPU expansions with this laptop?
What are the specs?
Now we are left with the question if it will sell well? The main goal of running a company is to generate profits while maintaining other things such as brand image, social responsibility etc…
Why did Linus buy the segue?
How are things on the software side? No bloatware I hope
How about plug-able battery?
What about external GPUs? 👀
Why don't framework put AM4 Motherboard in that laptop? So consumers can easily change Ryzen processor if needed
How do you upgrade the upgrade architecture? Pretty neat, though...
What about gpu ?
Where is the video, “Why do I use a wired mouse?”
only thing i could have wished for is cinebenchscores or a mention of wether this was preproduction and the company asked not to give out performance stats or something like that
While I really do like this laptop and its concept, I would be hesitant as will they still be around selling compatible parts/upgrades in 2 or 3 years?
No gaming benchmarks?  I'm guessing that "Iris Xe Graphics" just aren't very good so they didn't want to highlight it.
Have you disassembled a Dell latitude/precision? While this laptop has some nice perks, like the I/O, it's not that different from a support perspective
Is no one else going to talk about the dead leprechaun under his sink ?
what opportunity for them with these times of the right to repair and so many tinkerers and all that
Is it just me or is this the first time Linus actually didn't have any super bad to say about a laptop.
Was the pricing ever mentioned?
I fail to see how this is "completely upgradeable".   Yes you can drop more ram and more disk space right onto the board, but propriety USB 3.2 "cards" are throwaway gimmicks that only ensure profit for the manufacturer.   When apple lets you plug in any dongle you want with thunderbolt its scary and encroaching on right to repair, but when these guys take it a step further with proprietary accessories using universal parts (use twice the plastic to have two cards over), they get a pat on the back.
Linus looks like he's doing this review inside of a stock kitchen at Ikea, or is it just me?
Just curious; who downvotes a video like this? Those people must live in darkness and have a miserable life.
at +$3000CAD, the only question is: Can you mine ETH with it ? answer is NO so I will pass...
Drivers? What are those!
Website is down?
Can't you just get a $50 thinkpad and upgrade it? That way you don't need to worry about a little dongle to plug in anything. Sure they're kinda old, but they are tried and true.
A COMPLETLY UPGRADABLE LAPTOP?***  ***well except for the most important part: the CPU 😬
100$ FOR THAT THING??? OMG IMA ORDER IT RIGHT NOW!!!
Now for the real test: will they ship to New Zealand?
Dad jokes and girlfriend complaints with LINUS?
But will it upgrade to w11? Or is that also optional hahaa. If youtube asks, this video changed my life.
Where's the mxm interface for a real graphics card?
Playing devil’s advocate here, the XPS 15 probably isn’t thinner than this laptop because it has a gtx 1650 it has to cool.
anyone else hear that music?
I have a question 1. Why do laptops/PC still use HDD as their secondary storage? Isn't using SSD better? Why not just use SSD as both primary and secondary storage? 2. Linus said that he used a 1tb SSD but he wouldn't use it as the boot drive. Why?
Can someone make an updated video on Linus dropping products
Why's his phone cracked 🤨
If only they could make it not ugly
WHY am i smiling and so happy about this computer. god damn it.
Remember PCMCIA cards?
Has anyone seen Linus buy anything during a review... ever?
How much of the design of these things is open source? Are the motherboards available to be purchased by themselves? Is there accessible schematics for the motherboard?
So, Linus. What's your favorite anime?
didn't dell made something similar way back few years ago?
First laptop with modular capability? Why no mention of PCMCIA?
This or System76's laptop? 🤔
Why moog have lighter voice, this video without music and alone?  Ah disrespected video
Haven't we had several attempts at this?
I really want to buy one, however I'm in Eastern Europe region, so I have no clue how much is the shipping gonna cost, and how easy/cheap would it be for me to find/order parts here.
Did Linus break their site?  I went right over to their site to try and check out a laptop and I couldn't change the CPU without getting an error on both the Canadian and American site!  Oh well... I guess I can wait :)  A question though about the modules... with a USB C interface could they just be connected to any other computer? That storage drive becomes really useful it's essentially a USB C Drive that just happens to slot into the laptop
Anybody wonder if it will be bought by Apple?
Am I the only one that wants this to have a ethernet jack that accepts POE power
9:25  Is it just me or did he put the two connectors in the opposite spots
anyone else getting the infinite loop of "something went wrong" when trying to order the laptop on their site?
Did I miss pricing?
Is it an LTT video if Linus doesn't drop something?
Does this thing run Arch?
Maybe the biggest thing is just affordable replacement parts. I cracked a laptop chassis, and JUST the chassis, just the piece of metal with no electronics, and the replacement part cost $500 USD. For a piece of metal. In a $1,000 laptop. I don't mind companies having a profit margin on replacement parts, but that profit margin should not be 2000%.
Can we talk about how the packaging is all brown cardboard? No glossy, plastic covered cardboard garbage.
Is frame.work listed on any stock exchange?
I wonder if all laptops will be like this in the future or if the idea will be killed since  company's want you to buy a new laptop every couple of years
Serious question tho....who the hell still buys apple products ?
The main thing NOT covered here, how is the performance compared other equally priced laptops? Rough conversion gives around $650 as starting point for other laptops with this CPU (17:00 - $749) Thats not that cheap, wont sell enough machines to stay in business so the upgrade path is most likely a mood point
just curious if anyone know what the refresh rate of the panel is? however if it becomes upgradable in the future, this is a company anyone should invest in
Did you buy it with Bitcoin?
I don't suppose they have a keyboard with a trackpoint?  ...Shut up, nub mice are awesome.
So I guess it's a wait and see regarding cpu/gpu/mobo swaps.
But...can it game?
looks like the framework website is kinda borked if you try to configure one. wonder if it's all the traffic from this video lol
There are still good companies in the world? Heresy I say.
is this only for US/Canada?
cleo much?
The camera on this laptop is better than the one on an MBP, wtf, apple?
Can this succeed, please?
Can you charge it without a Type-C card?
So are they going to sell motherboards with newer processors over time if you want to upgrade your laptop ? Will you be able to return the previous motherboard (functional of course) as part of the payment when you go to upgrade?  It's a shame that PGA CPUs aren't being produced for notebooks anymore, i remember when I change the athlon 64 TF-20 of my notebook by an amd turion 64 x2 tl-60, it was an incredible upgrade.
What if they put the custom AMD APU from Steam Deck?...  and turn it into a gaming laptop?🤔
Why not try framework expansion in Mac with usb c
what about graphic card ?
What’s the point of these I/O modules if they’re just some glorified dongles?
hey does anyone know if the coupon works for someone who lives in Canada, and is it in-store online?
Has Linus been working out? I don't remember him being so.... muscles.
Guess what my next laptop is
Where the see-thru keyboard has letters written on it.??????
where is thunderbolt so you can plug an external GPU in?
A computer hardware business actually caring about the consumer? Impossible.
Where do I have to sign to sell my soul and body to Framework?
Can you use the USB HDD Like a USB C Stick in other PCs?
is anyone else getting a error padge for the framwork link?
Is it possible to buy shares in this company? :)
FINALLY! Can we take out the speakers and put something actually useful there!??
are modular laptops still a far away dream?
Can the motherboard be replaced with a newer model? That'd partially solve the problem with soldered CPUs.  edit: Googled it, and yes you can! It's actually a core principle of the design!
Standardized modular mobile GPU please?
i hate when companies say "launches in summer" "launches in fall" IDK WHEN UR SUMMER IS, I GOT SUMMER RN, JUST TELL ME THE MONTHS U GONNA LAUNCH IT IN
Wait does this support thunderbolt 3 or 4?
dude if they have a gpu adapter that I can just stick like a 2080 into the motherboard similar to that of that mobile razer box Im paying triple plus shipping for it
So what CAN go into those 4 side modules slots, apart from SSD or various USB/TB/video connectivity?
Very good . But what about the price of upgrade stuff.  How much it cost
I thought you were paid for those segways....
even better than the magnetic charging module idea, wireless charging module  i want to know if this thing can handle a valve index, and if not, when/if they'll ever have options that can handle it
You assemble it yourself? So it's an IKEA laptop 😉
Did it survive the Linus drop testing
Tell me has a good Linux drivers support. And this will be haven
Oh man, why do I am integrated into the Apple-System??
Am I the only one noticing that these upgrade "modules" are just recessed proprietary USB-C dongles?
How would Framework react to hundreds of claims of faulty internal components, because people are clumsy with screwdrivers? Warranty claims might burn them, which would be a big shame.
Is good for gaming?
The framework website appears to be busted?
How is this laptop real???
But can it game?
I know the upgradability is really cool, but I don’t know how you could trust non-OEM parts to install. Seems like a security nightmare to me.
is the screen upgradable ?    Let's say I want a brighter screen ,  or a more color accurate screen ?
Is it possible to have this connected to an eGPU? Say for an RTX 30 series GPU? Thanks!
It just needs more keyboard, more trackpoint, less touchpad...
17:25  Wait so it doesn't have windows 10 preinstalled?
Am I the only one who thinks that the bottom panel of the laptop looks very similar to ThinkPads?
But can you get one with an internal CD-RW drive?
"Storage expansion cards" you mean pendrives?
cmon, how much did they pay u
Nice Idea, but I want an option with a GPU, as I want to game a bit on my laptop. Also nice to have´s would be Ethernet, more ports (3 are pretty much the lower limit IMHO), and a F*ING KEYBOARD WITH FULL SIZED ARROW KEYS FFS :(
Who the heck uses DisplayPort?
What about the GPU, for me that is a deal breaker if you can't change it
The user experience feels like it's the IKEA of portables.  The idea of upgradable is great. However, don't they still own the end to end process via the ecosystem they've created? You're still tied in to them for the upgrade paths. We can only dream of full standards compliance...
This video feels kinda sluggish and weird. Are you recording in 24 FPS? With an Iphone? It feels weird.
my biggest question is, can u put custom keycaps and mechanical switches into the keyboard?
the framework website appears to have crashed? too much traffic.
Who edits your videos? Kudos to them...
15:33 use one of those Volta chargers?
Magnetic connectors are guarded by apple/microsoft patents????/??? I thought nobody else was interested in making them
Linus, this laptop is very exciting. Can you do a test to see if it will run Linux? By what I see there should be no reason it wouldn't and I would love to know for sure. You see, I run Linux as a daily driver and would consider buying this laptop if it can. Thanks!
Also what about the gpu?
I wonder who would dislike such video of a good product like that?! dell, asus, an apple user who thinks that a right to repair is a bad thing!
Sorry i cant see the video right now. But can you swap the processor and the video card?.
Why is there no windows in a apple store
So how much was it?
Will they use ryzen socs?
1080p 60fps webcam? Why any other didnt do that?!
What are the chances that one could install MacOS with full functionality?
Laptops don't have enough durable video ports. Did they fix that? Are those pluggable ports? That's the main thing I want besides Linux. If I break a thunderbolt port, I can't use 2 monitors. I thought the 2018 Macbook Pro was the best laptop today.
Ok is the processor upgradeable that's would be a nice feature?
No mention of the graphics card? Can that part be upgraded? I'd be interested on how well it can game.
What was Linus talking about with running the motherboard in a pc outside of this laptop? Why would you want to do that? Did I miss something?
Could YT add a multiple click like ?!
but are the modular connectors propriatary?
Upgradable wireless? Dont checked new ones but once upone time there were whitelist of wifis, and machine wont even boot if u put non whitelisted one.
Is there libreboot or coreboot for this device?
Hopefully they add a more powerful CPU and GPU, this would be great if you could switch to a forget charger at home travel config with a lower powered processor and larger battery, then when you get home switch to a game config with a RTX 3060 and more powerful CPU option
But can it run crysis???
I need to tape the knowledge of the Linus community is there a laptop out there powerful enough to run Pimax 8KX (in Canada)
Could they also make the motherboard upgradable? order it with the cpu soldered, and then replace it?
What if someone casually comes and takes a port ?
Linus, could you put you entire type-c hub instead of one of the official modular IO connectors?
I want to know what is Linus's favorite anime show?
But seriously, will there be a trackpoint option for the keyboard?....
upgradeability, repairability and modularity is a selling point now?
I just wanna know if this has Thunderbolt or not! Could be a transportable desktop replacement for me if it does! 😁
does it come with windows?
Is there a mxm slot?
remember Project Ara...?
how many IO ports?  5 is a minimun  for me ?  would be good to have 1 ethernet, 1 hdmi, 2 usb(mouse + headset) and 1 charge port
Can you build pc in a gaining chair 🤔
Is there an optical drive compatible version? ^-^
This is now the video is the video I link someone when they ask me what laptop I would buy if I was held at gunpoint.
What about external GPU support?
Maybe the market it's not ready to provide plugs to that...maybe in future.
So when the Internal USB-C port breaks,  what happens to that?
When is there IPO?
Can we get a part 2 with some basic benchmarks and performance numbers?
Why is there website so extremly slow?
Hmm, I think having a couple of fixed type C ports or at least one since you need it for charging would make sense. That way they can save a bit of space on things you obviously need and leave more room for custom slots
Any gpu options? Or just integrated iris from the Intel cpu's?
5:20  Anyone remember PC and express cards?
I’d order myself one if I could afford it but maybe next year or something. I’m wondering if I can become like a parts dealer or something for them since I do own and operate an electronics repair shop
Can we have standardized laptop motherboard form factors? Like ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX but laptop. That would be so awesome.
9:30 you put the antenas the wrong way? black to white? wtf :P
Will it Hackintosh?
I'm confused. My Dell XPS 15 has two Type A USB ports. One on each side.
Unclear, does linus understand Apple and Sony are in a perpetual state of gas lighting now?
I was taking a look at their website and thought, would it be even cheaper if they sold and OS-less version of the laptop? Because I suppose part of the price I'm paying is for windows, and I'm comfortable with installing pop os on it or something
Huhum... Gaming or just high end version? And yeah touchscreen. Make retro connectors and turn it into a mini arcade laptop etc. Unlimited infinite ideas and possibilities!! I would love that!!🚀
Can you game on it?
I don't think the "battery disconnect" function is that, usually it means when you do it the system then powers down and you can then "safely" remove the battery, but when you power it on again it'll reattach the battery, it's a thing for maintenance.  Very cool with the modules tho, even if some of it is still not that "un-modular" on say, the latest Lenovo T series Thinkpads.
Anyone else nervous when Linus kept swinging that laptop around with one hand? I was just waiting for him to drop it at some point. He has a reputation to keep after all.😅
Wait, you gotta buy a USB-C expansion that connects to the laptop via USB-C... In order to charge the battery via USB-C. Okay.
WHY ISN'T EVERY LAPTOP LIKE THAT!
Is it just me or do ads no longer show on the timeline for any YouTubers? Cause I know some that are never demonetized yet there is no yellow mark where an ad should be...
A great example of this being a lie: the surface laptop 3. The previous 2 were a glued together nightmare where to open the device you needed to destroy the entire palmrest. The designers said they simply weren't willing to compromise on feel and appearance. And then with version 3, they changed the device to use screws and be user serviceable with zero compromises because everyone complained.
I've been waiting for you to do an episode on the Fairphone for 4 years. Can you please give it more than a less-than-a-second screenshot?
upgradable RAM?! even most laptops that are NOT entry level come with soldered RAM and if you're lucky they'll give a SODIMM slot
Is it just me or isn’t a bigger form factor laptop better. More space for what you need. And got reparable parts. I always think I’m gonna break modern laptops.
What about the GPU?
why would i have a steam library on this machine?
But wait... does it have captive screws?!
LTT whats is the best Gaming Laptop for Students right now? Because idk on what i should spend my safed money
Is this a German company? Because this screams German engineering
15:20 Linus, you  mean ... like this?
Is it only a 13,5” 🙈
Are they not up and running et? I went to the website and almost every page is broken.
Why is their website is borked?
were do i buy it?
is there a gfaphics card and can up upgrade so you don"t have to buy a new gaming labtop every 2 or 3 years.
But can u watercool it?
And who keeps hidden input "authenticity_token" in a html form...
but why the shitty glossy display? why? otherwise, i'd buy this with no hesitation.
Curious enough all of the other reviews including this doesn't have any performance test?
Can you change the GPU or add one?
Sounds great! But is it only me or is the Website still under construction?  Lot of false hyperlinks etc.
Any chance you could do a video on hooking up that external box to this Laptop?
Linus: How are these guys so together? Man: They got a strong framework  Absolutely amazing.....most probably it was scripted still, damn good
but, can it run minecraft?
Linus ! But what about graphics
Where is the funny girl he gave a job? Is she still around?
What about the MNT Reform Laptop? Nearly completely open source!
I would love to know how the speakers sound.  I use a MacBook because I depend a lot on the quality of the laptop speakers (very specific use-case, please don't judge).  I desperately want to get away from Apple.  Those speaker modules looked legit, so I'm hoping this can be my escape.
isn't that basically, what Lenovo does with their ThinkPad lineup? specifically the T models.
This is tempting, but I'm a bit annoyed that a USB type-A takes up a full modular slot, but that's not a deal breaker.
What about CPU replacement?
Did Linus mention that?
I wonder how long its going to take for Frame Works website to come back up LOL
What about changing the display?
No benchmarks?
11:55 what the hell was the editing team doing lmao
does the internal PCIE slots like the wifi one, doesn't it have a whitelist? for compatible devices? can I go and connect anything there?
These are preorders? When do they ship?
But here's the true question: Can it run Crysis?
I can choose between single and dual channel? Im close to tears 😭
Now only question when will this product be available in india.
But can it CAD giant Solidworks models?
Why not just build the power LED on the same power line as the camera? Why bother with a built in shutter.
Sorry can Someone tell me a good double monitor arm or 2 single monitor arm?
I wanna know the price of the company to buy it-----Apple
Both thick and flimsy???
Can we get a performance test?
Seriously? Linus is sooo amazed. Haha! So are we.
The real question is... Gaming laptops when?.. :D
But how do I put a 4K 60FPS camera in there?
So no thunderbolt?
Can i have a cheap monitor? I noticed ur other videos and i was wondering if yall just kept them if u do may i have it ?
What ever did happen to that Dell/Alienware gaming laptop that was upgradable? Did they not follow through with ANY upgrades!?!
but, can it GAME?
11:53 What happened there ??
What is the point of all this if separate parts are only selling by the same company? Another wanabe soyboy nerd yada-yada...
Can these guys partner with the Linux system integrators like System 76 and the like? Please?
Is their site down?
Is it possible for graphics cards to be an add-on using this interface (USB 3.2)?
Looks cool but why do they seemingly have the slowest website I've ever come across?
Brilliant! I wonder if it has support to be a dummy terminal for another computer or mobile device over USB-c. That would be a cool way to extend its usefulness long past the practical life of its CPU.
Did the frame.work website crash ?
Did anyone see the cracked back glass on Linus's phone???
How does it perform though?
Q: Do people want this? A: Their site is down from all the LTT viewer traffic . . .
Did Linus just bash the same kind of laptop he was sponsored by a year or so back? (The toughbook at 00:13)
what about performance?
epic stuff. Will they be a public company anytime soon?
wait... does this laptop not come with windows 10?
This design looks nice. However, I kind of want to see a "thick" model Framework laptop, with compatibility for physical media drives such as DVD/Blu-Ray. Alternatively, you could have a component that replaces the drive with additional ports. Imagine having a full USB hub's worth of ports right on the side of your computer.
What is the software you use to monitor all the hardwares?
I have a question : will the framework laptop run MacOs?
Alex mentioned gallium nitride chargers only being included with high-end laptops, and I really wonder why. I have a 61w one that I use for my MacBook all the time, and it cost like $22. The concept of this laptop is really cool, and those nifty little type-c swappable modules are epic! I would assume that they could also be used with any laptop with a type-c port, and for sure would be way smaller than any HDMI adapters I’ve seen.
I'd like to see the charger port built in on the ne3xt revision, with being able to keep the 4 expansion slots. Other than that, looks freakin solid!
So Dbrand is gonna make skins for this right?
why does linus hold tech very dangerously to the point there’s a 50% chance he will drop it
What about graphics? I see they only offer iris graphics right now.
I am confused? Who is the sponsor?
This seems cool and all but who's this marketed at?  I'm a power user and I can count the number of times I've needed to open up my laptop in the last 6 years and the upgrade options in this would be just as limited RAM, IO and Storage.
Why do I remember this device and them already talking about it? It must be unlisted. Or something.  https://youtu.be/XFrJcjCbCA8 Adam Savage also talks about this laptop
Why is this only just becoming a thing? It takes a couple of nerds from different manufactures 18 months to create something that should have been around for years. Please take my money.
I wonder if once they're established enough, they'd make a chonkier gamer version.
this is pretty damn kool.  where is the gamming version??
So, is this un-macbook?
Can you charge it from both the left and right sides?
I might need to buy one of these laptops in the future if they came out with like an industrial version, like the old Toughbooks. Also did Linus attach the WIFI wires backwards at 9:26? Louis Rossmann also really seemed to love reviewing his unit.
Can I get that in europe?
I'm presuming you can't get RTX chips for it?
Very compelling. Anybody know speaker performance?
What makes this a completely upgradeable laptop?  Other laptops give you the ability to replace the Memory, Storage, screen, keyboard, trackpad, battery, etc, etc.  The only "special" thing this laptop has is a built in usb type c dock.
11:53 Who edited this? I MUST KNOW
Would Linux support be an issue here?
Can you please „hackintosh“ this?
How is it possible I never read about these guys anywhere. This company is AWESOME
https://youtu.be/0rkTgPt3M4k?t=651 does Linus realise that he can get a new mobo (with the soldered in CPU), then plug all the current parts in to it? So the parts being modular makes the whole thing upgradeable?  Also, https://archive.is/WrF5e is an archive of the website.
Now if MKBHD can also do a video to get maximum consumer coverage
Dedicated GPU ??
But the real question is, where is the 3090 ? If it's not a gaming-product, GTFO WITH THIS BULLSHIT USELESS SHIT! RAAAWRRR !!
If the some models are usb c then cant they be plugged into newer phones?
I guess you could also use one of those desktop GPU docks w/thunderbolt for gaming if you wanted? Sufficient speed from the USB-C?
Here is one thing i dont get....Why thin? whats wrong with chunky bigass tons of sockets around the thing! what happened to that?
This looks great, id like to see how maxed out this thing can be upgraded to.
You need a USB-C module, thats connect to a USB-C port, to conect a USB-C charger?
Glossy screen? Really???
Is the screen replacable? I think it would be cool if you could buy a screen replacements for this thing that has better resolution, screen type or have additional features such as touch screen. It would be just like buying a new monitor for a desktop.
The site seems very slow and I question the JavaScript implementation because of it. Its a form where you need to wait for a full reload every time you changed something.
How about the GPU?
14:17 damn, the Dells not even thinner. Wtf is the point of such tight integration then?
Couldn't a laptop motherboard manufacturer simply design a motherboard with a horizontal plug to connect an additional section of motherboard to existing motherboard? For example, solder the GPU to the motherboard sure but to the detachable segment of motherboard? Just sort of slot in an extra chunk of motherboard?
But does it have a full size ethernet port?  I hate that my work laptop doesn't have one. I'm a network technician....
Interesting gskill case, but why are tiny cases always so much money?
Can it run Linux easily?
so a laptop but the dongle is built in?
ok now how do we convince next door's boomer to buy one?
Their website is slammed right now, wonder why 😂 I’ll check later.
what if they do a partnership with camera's or mic or screens or simply sway the motherboard cpu gpu combo with a ryzen one and keep the rest as is possibilities are endless i love it
But how do I put a mechanical keyboard in there?
are they going to make 17" upgradeable game laptop? i will buy one...
But can it game? Does it have integrated graphics or a discrete GPU? Does it have a module for a GPU or do you have to do external over type C. I'm assuming it has thunderbolt since it's Intel. Any love for team red in the future? These are things I need to know.
Is there a Matte screen option?
Bring MXM gpus and socketable cpus back!
What GPU modules do they sell?
Hey is there a graphics card in this laptop? I didn't catch it if you mentioned it. Also if there isn't be can one be added?
Can somebody introduce framework to system 76? That would be gold.
0:14 Sauce plz?  Also, that'd be ridiculously thicc for an upgradeable ARM based desktop replacement with a full powered desktop grade GPU!
Where's my Type A port Dell? Damn
Remember when pretty much every laptop was configurable? Framework remembers.
NOW, what have they done about putting the execute signal on the 'newline or carriage return - on typewriters- and separating it to a an enter key off to one side!!! also get the damn apostrophe key away from the damn enter key, PLEASE TRAINED TYPISTS ARE FREAKING BEGGING YOU! IS NOT A TYPEWRITER, STOP PRETENDING TO FAKE A TYPEWRITER KEYBOARD!!!
Honest question/ Critique.  In a pretend world where every major laptop make did have a modular laptop series. Would that not create more E-Waste?
I've been wondering why laptops like this haven't been main stream for well over ten years. Obviously we have the technology.
1:57 Does anyone knows why Linus has a cracked phone?
Remember Google's Project Ara?
It's a really nice concept but what about pricing? Would it continue to stay affordable or would it mark up prices, similar to One Plus?
Dare we talk about the graphics performance?
Is there a GPU upgradable slot? If not will there be one in the future for say a power laptop edition? Great job as always you guys.
Did we kill the site?? Was in the middle of checking one out when *BOOM*
Can it run crysis ?
Wait is he wearing oura smart ring on his left hand ? Would love a review.
my main question is who is the laptop primarily designed for? gamers? is it more of a work/learning laptop? very cool design and i would love to see what these guys could do with a gaming specific laptop (i mainly wanna see if they come up with a way to make module graphic cards)
YOU SEE THAT? DO YOU SEE THAT?  FUTURE, SON. NOTHING LOOKS LIKE QUITE LIKE THAT   I LOVE THE LOOK OF FUTURE IN THE MORNING
How have they not come up with a non soldered mobile CPU yet.
Since you'll have to come back to framework for upgrades doesn't that make it at form of proprietary ?
I'd love to see long term coverage of this company! Especially when they release display and motherboard upgrades!   I'm also curious how they're going to handle major tech jumps. Like what happens when USB 4 modules come out and the motherboard doesn't support it. Is this handled through some kind of generation system or just a ton of warnings when you purchase the module?
Honest question. Have linus broke a piece of tech before having a chance to do a video for it.. or during video (with no replacement) ???
Isn't showing the order number bad? 17:50
I really like the concept, but you can't deny it's worrying not to know if it will work well enough to still see new components sold by them in 2-3 years. For the moment, I would only buy it for what is available right now. If they are still around and strong by that time, good, but if not, I wouldn't be disappointed.
Why does the backround music sounds like my phone beginning to ring constantly
I use a magnetic charger on all my laptops. How you ask? I use Volta chargers via USB-C ;-). It's basically the best way to make any laptop use magnetic charging. Also works on your phones, headsets, smart watches, and anything that uses USB C, lightning, or Micro USB.
Is this love?
Do you guys warn these companies of when you post a review to the channel ? https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%201-d&q=frame.work
Linus dropped his Note 9? Why am I not surprised?
Where do I buy one
like any other laptop a soldered cpu? my old gaming laptop would like a word with its full 775 cpu socket xD
Does this laptop by framework have an upgradable gpu?
ummm. . did you cause their site to crash?
Ok but wont the qr codes fade after years of wear and tear and especially the heat from the laptop would make the print of the qr codes fade
What's the green thing hanging out of the bottom drawer?
FRAME WORKS - IKEA, what is going on here....
imagine if later down the line they do gaming laptops...i know it could be kinda impossible but just a small What If
But can it game?
Can we install mac os x on it? Anthony, make it happen.
How to define a good product? Depends on will your website crash after reviews appeared.
The idea is cool, but $1,000+ for a laptop with no gpu and that you need to assemble on your own seems extremely steep.
Does it have thunderbolt?
Even their YouTube channel is answering questions at the comments, who are they and why are they so kind
Could it run games though? Or would I be able to use an external GPU to plug into an adapter for it?
Do they build a dock to store a USB mouse dongle inside the laptop?
nice work fellas their site isnt responsive now... do you all need a new toy?  xD
upgradable wireles modules????????? umm nooo very few manufacturers do not firmware lock there bios to allow such a thing
Dosent ThinkPad have full sized CPU's in some of their laptops?
Do they have plans to include graphics card modules later on? Because I think that'll create a lot of interest. Also, what's not to stop 3rd party suppliers from building and selling upgradeable parts, unless there are patents? How will they maintain profitability then?
Dang this product looks really exciting! You guys think they ship to mexico? :P
we crashed the framework website?
But can it game?
Ahh, will there be a gaming version of this? THAT WOULD BE SO FREAKING AMAZING!
I have a question, so if the motherboard/ processor come as a single replaceable package can i swap out intel for AMD in the future or something like that ?
Did they dox Linus' preorder number on shown in the video?
Are they shipping these out to South Africa?
Any plans for models that support graphics cards? Surprised this wasn’t addressed.
Wait… why tf did the laptop not come with windows activated? Weird
i guess we are all crashing their configuration website right now?
not enough room people want thin laptops what about gaming laptops like the alienware m51
That's fine and all Linus but the real question is can it run Doom???
So.... any tips on how to convince my spouse I need to buy a new laptop again? :)
So I guess since Linus didn't drop this thing, he crashed their website instead??!
Does anyone know if they are planning on making a 2 in 1 model of this, with a laptop mode and a tablet mode with a 360° hinged touchscreen? If they will, add a quality stylis and I will happily buy one of those in a heartbeat.
So Linus tell us which anime show do you love? Please tell us!
Does it work well with linux?
Great great model... Question. How Can one easily get the schematic and boardview to fix the motherboard?
Can we stop talking about the (great) laptop an just focus on linus phone  - 1:56 - That thing probably got dropped a lot!
The only thing I'm left wondering about is the GPU upgrade path. CPUs are soldered, sure, but GPUs are talking over PCI-express so in principle it should be possible to slot them, via some SFF PCIe connector (like M.2) and a back-shell mounting spot alongside the motherboard. This is, no joke, something that's been grinding my gears for years - if the current product offers GPU replacability/upgradability, or when a future version gets it, I might have to buy one just on principle.
What kinda video card do these have in them?
How does it handle Linux (Ubuntu)? Any driver issues?
lol that laptop is 10 better than my pc :D   is gt 1030 still good with ryzen 3? i want to buy them so i have a better pc :(
is their site overloaded? It just wont load for me :,D
What happened to the one similar to this a few years ago? There was a laptop and a phone you could click together in separate blocks
well will the big tech learn something or will profit hide this??
Didn't G.Skill bought that segway from u tho?
mechanical webcam shutter and hardware mic switch? @technologyconnections is typing....
Hello linus, i play apex legends on intel uhd and i get at  most 40 fps after  playinh for a while on lowest graphics and on 1024×768... do yk any ways i can get  better frames?
Why no red chips tho?
If that laptop was 360degree and touch, i would buy it right away. Couldnt Framework sell a Cover/bag that is small, but has pockets for the upgradable modules so I don’t have to carry them separate?
You can just pop off the bezel and replace it?? This thing is wild! Lmao
As much as I'm all for this, is a device really "COMPLETELY" Upgradable when the most important upgradable components can only be bought from the manufacturer? It just seems like free labour at this point, why not make everything cloud based so that it actually benefits normal users and not only the tech enthusiast crowd? Just like we get electricity from the grid can't we use the cloud to run heavy applications such as games and access our data? That would be the real upgrade
Do they ship to the Czech Republic?, because I want at least one of these! This is so cool!
the idea of coming back to the company for upgrades and customizations wb knock off customizations brought up by various other companies wud there be a decrease in sales for the company same like how when Apple brought up Air Tag as a new thing, the next week there was many knockoffs of the cover of the Air Tag  so wud that be a problem?
0 minutes in: Hmm, upgradeable screen?
Why is Apple always the Low lambing fruit? 😢🥺. They don’t do many things right, I can’t justify them. But they aren’t the only one. And while most of us on this channel know that, always going for that Low longing fruit makes non-tech-savy people would pick on Apple without fairly critiquing other companies.
Hasn't Eurocom been making modular Laptops for, oh I dunno, years?
Did this video just crushed the framework site?
Did we bring their website down?
To be honest, I'm constantly being distracted by that green thing hanging out from that drawer.  Linus! What is this bruh? 🥱
Isn't it a bit early talking about upgradability? You have shows replacable part but when or if there are going to be actual upgrades we'll only see in a few years but not now.
how much
Anybody elses anxiety levels rise everytime Linus was holding the laptop and moving it around? Other than that i'm looking into this laptop
I love this thing so far, when are we getting the full review?
I wonder if it’s compatible with Linux. Some laptops have weird drivers that make them finicky with most Linux distros
I wonder that instead of perfect finish on the lid, what if they use the covers like dbrand. Like user can design the top lid & the sticker company will send it to the customer or the company itself can print it with the sticker company partnership.
But will people buy it?
Their website it down right now, I wonder why
We crash there servers I think it is not loading
Did the demand of people coming from the LTT vid just crash there site? Think they are goin to be happy with demand.
How'd they fix that 1080p webcam but these others can
If I were in the laptop market, I would be sold. I am interested in the motherboard cost. Like if I want to upgrade my CPU, how much would that cost? Also, will there be a version with a GPU?
Where do I sign my butt to this company?
How hard is it to do Linux on this thing? Linux may not like the swapping bits out as much and doing terminal bs might get annoying. Could y'all make a video on this please.
Wasnt any laptop used to ????
Did you not show off one hell uf a modular laptop about 1 year ago? 🙈
But can it run windows 11
What's the base model price?
why is linus being a karen today ?
Is this sponsored??
How much is it?
Why would Apple educate its users? They're gonna lose money if they did that.
lol, the framework website went down......is it from us? ooooops
did we crash their site?
When will we get a CPU and GPU swappable Laptop?
ethernet build in?
Where is Louis Rossman??
And how much will it cost .
Is everyone watching this video visiting their website...cause it's lagging 😂😂
Framework here!  Happy to answer any questions folks have on the product.
Are the expansion modules supported on smartphones as well??
Is it just me or framework website isn't working? Did LTT viewers got the website to crash? (Even if it's not fun it's kind of a good thing...)
🤔 but the batter question will be. Can we play games in it
If those expansion cards interface using USB C 3.2, do you really need the USB C ones, can you just plug your USB C cable into the expansion port without the dongle.
My question is whether I can get a GPU, even a low powered one, at some point.
dude did we crash the website?? xD hahah
Linus what did you do... Their website is down
I was wondering if/when LTT would take a look at these
Proprietary modules that remember the pcie expansion cards and the LG G5 disaster? Why not?
11:56  Linus out of context, bruh what did I just witness? You're welcome 🤷‍♂️
Who still wants USB-A on a laptop?!
I still don't understand why the WIFI connectors need to connect to the WIFI chip directly rather then to where it is connecting so you never have to mess with disconnecting and reconnecting them when taking it out or putting it into a system.
11:35 What the hell is a financing company doing in a tech video?
What about gaming laptop like this 😎
wait it can be both look at what pine64 does
is the website down?
Who crashed the site?
If you cant upgrade the CPU and GPU then whats the point?
Sponsor is G-SKİLL but rams are crucial?
whop… think you slashdotted  the webpage…
9:12 Is that a thing now? Wow.
1:55 Anyone else didn't surprise that Linus' phone is cracked?
Am I actually the only one that likes thicc laptops?
The Linus effect? - Can't connect to the Framework website. They are undergoing maintenance.
I wonder why Linus use I watch ,  If he uses a Samsung mobile
Oh my god that poor note 9 without a case..... WHAT HAS HE DONE TO YOU!?!? POINT ON THE SMARTPHONE DOLL WHERE HE TOUCHED YOU! 1:57
Wot if u could build ur own car or even house
Man will I ever see a day when I can change the processor and gpu on my laptop?
is anyone else currently having trouble using the framework website
Did this video crash their website?
I mean... does it look good tho? I don't know about that one, chief.
Ok, lately I have been pondering.....Does Framework have a BIOS that allows the user to use Advanced Settings?
what if a verified person replies here
Engineers from Apple intentionally making something repairable? Now that’s something you don’t see every day
