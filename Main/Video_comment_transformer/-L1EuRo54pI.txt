What is the name of intro song?
where is the laser sight????????????
Is there a ps4?
Who wants to bet that even once the remake is released, Capcom will still port RE4 to PS5 and Xbox Series S/X anyway?
Seeing how badly Capcom fumbled RE3 remake, has me a bit skeptical.
is resident evil 4 remake  coming to ps4 ?
Can have multiplayer camping? Please 🙏
Man ….. why not on ps4
No ps4? ;-;
Is this only for ps5?
Notthe same voice actors?
1:28 are you telling me Bitorez may behave as Mr x in re2, like chasing and that? :DDDD
When resident evil 4 the original will launch on ps5?
will we have a russian voice acting?  or we second grade?
I wonder what Ramon Salazar, Krauser, W-3, Venrdugo, and the big cheese are going to look like in this remake.
Are this re4 is remake? Like both of last re2 and re3 remake? Or this is something different?
Where's everyone going, bingo?
I might be in for a remake of 4, but what about Code: Veronica?
Is this going to be a play station only exclusive?
"Whatt're you buy'in?"
Can't wait to find out what Capcom will chop off this time. Will it be Assignment Ada? Separate Ways? The Mercenary Mode? Or perhaps we'll be lucky and they'll remove all these extra modes like they did with the RE3 Remake.
btw i don't get the hype behind the same game? they should've created something new with similar feel to this
Is this Exclusive?? 😃
Wait is it only going to be for the play station?
Will this come to Playstation 4?
Where is RE3
Is this the remastered resident evil four
Will it also come on ps4
When will  Japan finally grow up and make adult  games like Shadow of rome again? RE is a  child game
This game no more in PS4?
Did they make Leon chubby or is it just me?
I wonder if there isa  merchant in this game like original one
why these RE remakes so dark.
Plz whats the name of music 00:21
is it the part of next  re village
Will the animation where you look at her skirt from the bottom be kept?
So it won't be on the ps4?
Everything looks great, but there was something that bugged me: at 1:29 we can see the mayor (which is great), but what's the deal with the hands? His hands look very small in comparison with his huge body.  Other than that, I swear by the almighty gods, by the time this game comes out, I'll have my PS5
Why the flamenco music?
Can someone tell me cause I wish I can replay all the resident evil games how many until now did they remake did they remake RE1-2-3-and now 4
Still Leon help?
Where are my peeps that wanted Code Veronica remade instead at
They skip code Veronica?
Is it gonna be on ps4?
Can i playing this game for my ps4 pro?
will ashley being usefull for leon except open a door? we'll see
Not for ps4??? 😂😂😂
HOW MANY PESETAS DO I NEED TO HAVE THE MERCHANT IN THIS REMAKE?!? Also leave the striker glitch 🙏 🙏 🙏
Is that all, stranger?
Where is everybody going
Heh heh heh.  What are ya' buying?  What are ya' selling? Microtransactions.
OMFG but what about using Leon's original voice?
PS4? what not?
I really love re series, specially re4. But do we really need a remake for this masterpiece?
are we gonna hear ashley calling leon again like “LEON HELP”
Question is will they keep the currency pesetas because when the original game came out Spain had already changed to the euro
Is it only going to be on PS5..?
Am i the only one who wants the old controls but slightly updated? I mean, the new system is cool and all but RE4 was about the new (back then) controls. Loved it that you couldn’t just move around while aiming haha. Call me crazy but that’s part of what I loved about the older RE
Can we look up the skirt again?  Edit: Oh and will she scream my name every few seconds too? LEON LEON LEEOOOON!!!
is it gonna have the dog?
Is this a remastered version of the original game?
Un forastero! Where's Code Veronica?
Remaster 5 if they keep co op make it more horror then action based
Can it be march already?
Will they release it for ps4 as well ?
Please, can we walk n' shoot at the same time?
Is that shot of luis from the ambush inside the house part ????
will this be availabale for PS4 too???
Does Ashley gonna make us angry in this remake as well??!
Song please ?
So i cant play it on pc?
0:10 why is the date in some retarded format? there is no 24 months...
Uhh yeah but why it doesn't even remotely feel like resident evil 4 ??
Where's my Dino Crisis 2 remake?????????????????????????????? Capcom, PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!
why not re2 code veronica??
Is there any chance that guy will survive in this remake ?
Did capcom delete some screen or some gun,or add new content
Is reality lol thought it was meme
for ps4 got?
I wonder if they’re gonna keep the peeking feature with Ashley😂
No PS4 then? :( Damnit!
Still no Parasite Eve? No Legend of the Dragoon?
Could Capcom top a Masterpiece? I think re4 doesnt need a remaster cause is already perfect.
Where is RE VERSE !?
I Wonder how they will do the Rollercoaster in the Castle
Is it free?
i wonder how they approach the part where with the Girl. I'm getting flashbacks of the "Leon" screams.
Is it going to be available for ps4????
Why does it not say psvr2 support here and it did on the state of play, I think it’s because you accidentally leaked the psvr2 release date 24 march 2023👀
Man where’s Leon’s original RE4 va
FINALLY!! finally, they showed us the Announcement trailer for this game, plus the gameplay & graphics on the cutscenes are perfect but are we gonna be able to switch between characters throughout the game for example we start off playing Leon but when he gets knocked out we switch to Ashley and then Ada Wong. details people, details!
No way this is real. Am I dreaming?
Is this game coming on ps4 pls anyone tell me
Will it be censored like 3?
Is that Ada Wong? 1:28
Is this remake going to be an 18+ like the original one or have they watered it down to make it 15+ ?
Who is Leon talking about in the end? Who is on the picture?
Take your bets now, is it a horror game or action game?
I wonder what they're gonna do in place of those quick time event sequences considering qte's aren't really used in games at all these days.
is that Ada or Ashley? Ada wears a qipao dress.. But the hair is too dark to be Ashley.
Is that all stranger......
Guys do you know if the game will be available on Switch?
Hold up, does the merchant guy also got remake for appearance??
Come this for Ps4?
Well!!! I'm really nervous about the moments and the kicks ? Maybe conserved or ad new?? What's going happen!! 🙂😅
No ps4?... 😢
Where's everybody going?
can't wait to hear "What are you buying stranger?" again
Ashley is actually beautiful?????
I wonder if they can incorporate the ragdoll effects back into this like what they did in RE2, but then it will clash with the point earning system to upgrade weapons. I was extremely disappointed they removed it in RE3, felt like a huge downgrade.
Nothing about the island? And the Merchant? I'm a little bit worried.. Capcom don't ruin something that is already perfect. 😬
an interesting game
Game coming for pc ps4???
why is he so young like in Part 2?
Will be on ps4?? 🙏🙏
Not hype though. After Vampires, what next? Drug Cartels? 😂
another remake?
Is it coming out on PS4?
can we still flash bang the bird|??
I don’t get it. Why are they trying to remake perfection?
Is it coming for 8th generation?
i wonder how would the developer handle the decapitation scene / death scene
Who still can't buy a PS5?! lol. 💯
great!!! but where is Code Veronica? that game came before this one, i really hope they don't forget about that amazing game!! Regards from one of the bigest fan of the saga
Gee what's next? RE5 and RE6 gonna be remastered?! This is just plain stupid! I get it remastering 2 and 3 but 4, 5, and 6 are perfect the way they are!!
For all the people watching this video who you got Chris or Leon ?? But resident evil never really been trash so looking forward to it gotta entertain the fans🔥
What about Resident Evil Code Veronica Remake??
Map? Spain Voices? Mexicans Hotel? Trivago
anyone knows what's the title for guitar song in the opening? it's kind of a flamingo or some sort yeah,  so cool
No Code Veronica then?
Does anyone know if the music at the start is original, or already has a full release and title?
the thing i don't understand is why code veronica has not being released as a remake when resident 4 is after code veronica
Canadian Carlos? My maple syrup isn't ready!!!!!!!!
Will enemies fly from a high kick like in original game? If yes then with modern graphics its gonna be hilarious 😂 But if it's made smooth, would be also cool, because hand combat animations in Remakes of 2 and 3 are basically usage of knife
0:53 but why does she have the stupid anime girl run?
Where's everyone going, Bingo?
Does anyone know name of the song in the intro? Its amazing i need it
Maybe I'm being a bit nit picky here but Leon's clothes look a bit off, especially the pants, it's as if his clothes are too big on him.
But will this one get an iPod port, as well? :o
Am I crazy or did certain scenes in this trailer look like "the village" from RE8?
No ps4 version?
Can we also expect Resident Evil 5 remake? 🤔🤔🤔
Is that all, stranger?  Heh heh heh... Thank you!
Is there a full version of this spanish song at the beginning?
Why is the date wrong? There aren't 24 months.
Am i The only one who’d like RE 1 remake in style of RE 2 and 3 ?  Considering that RE 4 is getting remake treatment of 2 and 3
Hope that they will still include the Mercenaries mode compared to RE3 Remake that Mercenaries is not included.
Why did they skip Code Veronica ? 😞
Why ps5 only?....ps4 please..
Can someone PLEASE tell me the name of the song?
Wait so is Ashley’s model Ella Freya? I can kinda see the resemblance
What if RESIDENT EVIL 5 was REMAKED soon?
Will it come out for PS4?
but the real question is: can we still flashbang crows?
It's not the same voice actor is it?
will the game have Polish subtitles?
What??? is this real????
What happened to resident evil reverse
is this game available on playstation 4 ?
Will it only come out for ps5?
How do they not show a quick cut of a chainsaw starting at the end of the trailer?
Anybody knows the name of the song?
what????
Where's my infinite rocket
So is the og cast returning or is it gonna be another capcom recast
I wonder if they keep the line about "ballistics".
Stranger, stranger... Now that's a game!
Where’s Luis at?!
when does he come?
Where'd everybody go? Bingo?
Where's everyone going bingo?
they prolly messed up the gameplay ill wait for the reviews
Why remake
Resident Evil 5 Remake when?
Does it have actual Spanish voices?
Is this a dream?? Am I dreaming???
Are they just going to skip code Veronica
With real Spaniard voices this time?
is it coming on ps4?
Please,make Ashley less crybaby than the original >.<
Can someone remind me what content in a nutshell was cut from re3 and 2 remake? If I remember correctly originally re3 was short on it's own. Can someone elaborate more?
I wonder if Ashleys gonna be just as annoying in remake as she was in the original😅
Is this ps5 only? I hope ps4 pro too
Great trailer but can't help thinking if they're remaking all these RE, why not remake RE1 and REZero too....? Would love to see those in modern graphics and gameplay.
I don't know re4 remake released
soundtrack and audiodesign are very messy/questionable yet, let's see how the final version turns out
Wonder what modders are gonna do to Ashley with this one!
is it a remake or another new game????I've never played resident evil 4
1:28 is that Ada Wong ?
Very dubious about this one. Excited and hopeful no doubt, but reserved.
What about code veronica?
I really hope this isn't a trim down version of the original, which has been the trend with the other remakes
Why im not hyped?
Pointless?
But what about Leon’s original voice actor? :(
It's a remasterazation ?
Why does this masterpiece need a remake?
Is it Third person?
Fellas, are we expecting the return of kicks and suplexes?
Are they bringing back Sandy Cheeks to voice Ashley? (Yes, the woman who voiced sandy cheeks in SpongeBob did Ashley's voice over, you'll never unhear that now that you know)
Is It On PS4
Can we move while aiming this time? 💀
Dude this is real???
Something feels off. Why is Ada in her RE6 outfit? Why does Leon have PTSD instead of being the lovable action hero we know and love?
Coming on PS4??
1:58 who else already can hear ashley's scream ?
If they cut out the ballistics line, I aint buying.
what kind of lether jacket is this ????????????? !!!!!!!!!!!!!
IS RE4  going  to be on ps4 any chance or is it just ps5.
really? only ps5?
Let me guess: cut content, doesn't feel like the original and way too dark to see what's going on.
Ok really cool, but where is Dragon's Dogma 2?
Where's Ashley's Dumbo ears?
Music same. To same?
Why is this on Playstation state of play? They not got big enough titles of their own that they can put on?
what if chris redfield shows up and hes just like "chris redfield" and then punches the rock
Is this RE 4 remake? A lot of people don't like RE 4 and say RE 4 is bad but I just enjoy the game.
with Unreal 5 ?! WOW !
Now, lets see how much of the original they change or flat out cut from the game.
why did you show me a powerpoint
It's Not Coming In Ps4?
Terrible voice actors. Was that Luis? Fakest spanish accent ever 🤦‍♂️ and don’t get me started with the priest. He sounds more British than Spanish 😂
Who’s happy? Who is happy? 🎉
plz don't tell me Ada is without cheongsam this time
How do you improve that which had no flaws🤔
as a man that owns 5 re4 copies across all platforms do i get a discount?
Is still Eduard the same face model ?
Why? The original is a classic. Just make a new game.
Maybe they will cut lots of content like they did on re3 maybe
Can't wait to see the Merchant again and get to hear his "what are ya' buyin'?"
How can they not have the original voice actors again?!? I really want to love this but half of the reason why I love the original is the cheesy dialogue that it had.
Will this also come to xbox?
and why wasn't Veronica's code made??
Whoa, they’re actually remaking RE4?
Am I the only one thinking the graphics look kinda worse than the other two remakes? Or maybe it's a slight change of the art style?
Hmm..neat.
Where is Dino crisis ?
It's coming to Xbox too right?
re 4 have a lot of enemy variants, i wonder what they will looked like in this remake.
Sad that PS4 is already being left out but if you think about it, maybe it was for the best so Capcom can maximize the hardware of PS5 to bring us a masterful experience once again. One question though, is it gonna be a third person shooter just like the original? Or is it an FPS this time? I mean the VR feature worries me that it will be just like Resident Evil 7 where FPS was the one they used in favor of VR.
Wait... This isn't a remake?
why are all the comments in spanish?
Am I the only one who noticed Leon and Ashley are in their 3.5 outfits?
I love the fact that they are remaking them all, but have they completely forgotten about RE1?!?!
What does Xbox have again, something gamepass?
15 fps?
Will this be launched on ps4?
So is this the remake like resident evil 2 and 3?
What about Resident evil 1?
Wait. Is it Matt Mercer as Saddler?
I need help stranger's is this game coming to ps4..
Will they make it more horror-oriented or shooting-oriented, is the question. Tho, I do am excited for the game. Besides, RE4 indeed is a masterpiece at its release. We'll see.
1:16 PS2 Polygons on the skulls? Dang! i thought it going to be a Next-Gen Graphics 💔😒
I still play the original often, will be weird not having tank controls and it looks like they are using RE6 Leon 🤮? I’m not for sure, but it sounds like a different VA from OG as well, tragic. I will definitely play this, just don’t expect too much.
Where's that classic cheesy action movie tone? Feels like this takes it a little too seriously for what RE4 originally was.
Another remake?? Lol
I only have one question :- have much is Ada's bikini outfit DLC gonna cost?
I get that the script will be updated, and dialogue will be completely different   But please, tell me they'll keep such glorious lines like "Your right hand comes off?"
And when RE Reverse?
Why is there so much bean in this comment section
Not on ps4?
So is it ps4 and 5 or just 5
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't they remake this one twice already?
remake? remaster? all the way
I wonder if we’ll still get the same weapons like in the original game or we’ll we get brand new weapons
Does this mean Capcom is skipping Code Veronica Remake? Please say it ain't so.
The real question: Will Ashley be annoying too in this remake?
I want to know how are they going to fix Ashley, hopefully she won't be as annoying to protect this time around xD
Is it going to be for VR2????? I hope so
is it for ps4????
lol, next gen really doesn't begin until 2023   what's the rush to get a next gen console?
Why are there a bunch of mexicans in the comments? This is the English PlayStation channel
Why ashly's face like this, not like a original game 😢
Will the game lenght be as long as the original ?
code veronica, when?
Where's everyone going.. bingo?
How about PS4?
Is it gonna be released on the PS4 too?
How about making new innovative games???? No?
Where is code Veronica
I don’t know man, this doesn’t feel legit
is that will be available on ps4?
Shouldn’t it be 4 Resident evil for the title logo? 😂
Gaming changed after 20 years. I wonder what the remake of the remake will look like 20 years from now.
oh come on! did you really have to change that iconic atmosphere!....this looks like almost every creepy game that came out within the past 3-4 years. Resident evil 4 was always instantly recognizable in every shot.
pls someone tell me that they use the same leon face model from re2 remake. either way, im so exciteddddddd!!!
only on ps5? how about pc
That’s awesome that they are remastering it but why are they waiting a year for it
When is it coming? Please tell
What's with the verdant forest?
Our leon is back? 😳🔥my childhood
REMAKE ?
Will it be compatible with PS4? I cannot wait defeating Salazar again on this remaster, still remember the desperation in beating him
this is only on ps5?
will there still be zombie Napoleon?
Wait is it PS exclusive?
1:53 why is leon acting sad doe😂
Why must they used that RE2 remake model ? 😥 Leon looks fat
Why are they remaking a MASTERPIECE?!?
Let me guess.. 5$ DLC for each unlockable costume including Ada Wongs original dress.
I wonder if they can remake resident evil 0 and 1
Onather disapointment🤔?
daddy capcom can we have an outbreak remake next?
All new voice actors ?
why can't they release it on ps4 too 😫
wheres the swag with this voice actor and new Leon?
Did they stop selling ps4 in India?
Let's see how much content they cut this time.
Will this be coming to ps4?
Is Aidan Gillen playing Sadler? Sounds a lot like him.
Who is in the photo that Leon is holding?
Is it really PS5 only though? I understand not having a PS4 version and I get Xbox exculsivity and all that but I'm hoping this gets a PC release.
Hunk getting his own game too?
Anyone knows if this is for ps4? Or just ps5
is leon the same model in re2 remake?
Ohhh... is this going to have 3/4 of the game removed too like 3 did?
I wonder if they"ll replace Ashley's skirt with pants in this new version. Leaving her with the original could be "problematic".
We justed asked for a normal game, not a masterpiece...
Did they changed Ashley clothes? I prefer the original sleeveless one.
They should have remade code Veronica it could've been better
y’all can’t make something new???
Why is everyone so hyped about this? This trailer looks really boring. Not trying to start a fight, just confused.
But why?
"The release is next year. How are you holding up?"  "Bad question, Hunnigan."
RE4 It's a long game.. It's only coming out in a year? how much did you cut? capcom? I'm worried about it
Where are Ashley's ballistics?
Here's a big question. Do we REALLY NEED this? The original Resident Evil 4 still holds up to this day.  If anything, Code Veronica deserves a remake. It really does.
Idk about that artsyle chief
Why make a remake of a game that was fine the way it was and has like 20 remasters? RE0, 1 and Code Veronica are the ones that need this treatment!
They just gonna be remaking all of the now?
I have the current RE4 on my wishlist, but now I'm wondering if I should wait for the remake next year. Not sure if PlayStation will do a free upgrade to the remake if people already own the original.
The game is already a masterpiece so why remake it again? so after doing Remake up to RE6 they will remake RE2 again but it would be "Resident Evil 2 Remake more that ever"
I have one question : please : is resident evil 4 remake is going be also ps4 ?
they're cutting out all the cheesyness? not gonna buy.
Before Code Veronica and RE Outbreak?  Capcom really are catering exclusively to 90 IQ mouth breathers at this point.
I have concerns about this. OG 4 aged incredibly and can still be played without feeling antiqued the way OG 2 and 3 feel (even if they are still great). Those games had a lot of upward mobility for a remake, I am not sure what can be done to 4 without making it worse unless it is just a massive visual overhaul.  We're getting to the point in the old games where they started resembling modern games aside from the graphics.
Special Edition PS5 Promo Bundle??
Is Ashley actually going to be helpful, or will this be Tired Babysitter: The Definitive Edition?
Is it me or the trailler kinda sucked?
Why Ashly looks worse ?? :/
Your right hand comes off?
Are we still going to get Sandy Cheeks yelling out, "Leon!" throughout the game?
Is it just me or is Leon's Jacket huge on him🤣
They're finally remaking this? I hope they updated the controls.
What are you buying?
my only question is this a remake or remastered ?
I’m not sure about remake… remaster would be nice though. RE 4 its a perfect game. There are some thing that needs polishing, but its something that can be done while doing remaster not remake
only PS5?
Is it gonna be only on Playstation or its gonna be on xbox
Where is everyone going bingo?
What're you buying?
Why?
Did they use baby face leon from re 2?
Where are the spanish insults?
I Wonder why they made Re4 VR if theyre gonna remake it anyway......Maybe to prepare us for RE4 Remake on PSVR2?
Since they have now remade all the past main entries, does this mean they will eventually remake 5 and 6?
Now can we have a Revelations 3 for the Switch 2.0?
Really? Remaking this one? Oh, just don't dumb it down like the other ones. This one deserves a full RE:MAKE.
Any chance this comes out for PS4? :((((
As cool as this is I can't help but think, why?  The original has aged like fine wine so this remake just seems unessesary
Game looks nice. But why? Just straight skipped over Code Veronica (the most outdated of the main games yet). And RE4 Has already been ported to literally every system and is backwards compatible on modern ones.
Very exciting love the original and definitely will be playing this. I also will be taking notes along the way seeing what is still there and if there are any big cuts made. Watching this made me wonder if we will get 3 playable characters in the Remake Leon, Ashley, and Ada? I know Ada had her Separate Ways extra in the original.
Why not in ps4?😠😠😠
PS5 exclusive ?? please release for PS4 as well
disgusting trailer how should I watch this video constantly blinking? same as if  they shown a slideshow
Are you sure it won't be a "Resident Evil Village 2.0"?  Anyway, just don't destroy the game with Woke stuff. That's all we ask...
Interesting but code Veronica would of been nice to make instead
5 and 6 remaster too?
My question is who’s voicing Leon, is it the same dude from 2?
Capcom.....why?😶  RE2 and RE3 remake made sense, but this right here makes absolutely no sense at all.
"What are you buyin'?" intensifies
I am enjoying these remakes but what if we got a RE1 remake instead? Or a Code Veronica
Ok but why though.
Where's everyone going? Bingo?
Where’s everyone going bingo?
ps4 or ps5?
Leon same voice as Ethan??
I dont know... Do you guy see this game as a new gen remake? I mean, trully PS5/Xbox X gen? I see the same PS4/Xbox One graphics. The same happens with Final Fantasy XVI. I dont see the same realistic graphics like Black Myth or the Unreal 5 demo shown for PS5.
Leon's face from re2 remake?  It has been 6 years after re2 incident, he looks a bit too young if they have in fact adopted this model for his face.  This trailer also has a resident evil village vibe to it I don't know why..
Can you imagine if they cut out the entire castle like how they did with the clock tower in RE3 remake.
Is that all, Stranger?
But the million dollar question is: Is the new Ashley equipped with Ballistics too?
Is this a PlayStation exclusive???
Let me guess; An RE5 remake next?  No remake for Outbreak or Code Veronica, I guess…just as well, it’ll be inferior to the originals anyway. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Why didn't they make Ashley in her school outfit? :(
Where's everyone going? Bingo?
Will they hire voice actors from Spain or will they still be Mexican? Actually, the sound from the intro is flamenco, so they should all be from Andalucía, that'll be terribly funny.
is it coming to pc?
Where is code veronica tho
Is this a PS5 Exclusive? I hope not. But I think it is.
Why doesn’t Capcom write that it’s a remake/remaster, this just confuses people
I wonder if the Remake will be faithful to the original like the QTEs and some action but should add more horror.
Wait what? This legit?
Wonder what is gonna be cut though.
Is it only on PlayStation?
The real question: is Leon still a pervert?
It’s only exclusive for ps5? Not steam?
Are they making this game more horror focused than action focused?
Can’t wait I’ll buy it on PS5 i have a question though. I wonder if it’s also comin the PS4 ??? If not there gonna miss on a lot of $$ a lot of people still don’t have a new console yet.
I wonder what Ashley wil look like at the remake any suggestions?
Why? We played this game 17 years ago. What is the point of this?
Will it have co-op like the original?
Idk about this one. Why the all new voice actors? Should have brought back the original ones. Sadler sounds bad in this new one
Luis Sera is black now?
Where is the merchant? :( I hope he's still in it
I can't help but wonder why, the other remakes are of a old dated PSX games so I get it. Whether as Resi4 holds up remarkably well and is playable on all modern platforms. If you ask me Veronica needed this treatment over 4.  Looks like it's going to be more a horror game but I dunno, they're playing with fire with this one.
ps4 graphics in ps5??
Wait is this ps5 only?
Salazar better have more screentime, my only ask
Where's everyone going? Bingo?
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES !!!!!!  This makes me wonder, will RE5,6 get remakes ? And will RE1 get a remake on the RE Engine ???
Why are we getting another re-release of RE4? Why couldn't we get a remake of Code Veronica? That's one thats been needing it for years and would benefit from it, whereas 4 is widely regarded as one of the best in the series. It doesn't need the remake, this could just end up damaging the original like the RE3 Remake did.
why
But Where Is The Code Veronica Remake?
will it be available for ps4?
Wonder if they too cut half content like RE3R
Is it for PS4 as well?
Why saddler voice sounds to young? I mean, hes an old man.  Is that him?
Am I the only one who wants the controls to be the same
Why ONLY PS5??? 😢😭  P.S: play has limits as we can see.
Will it be as short as RE3 remake?
Is this gonna be on PC too ?
Where's everyone going, bingo?
This doesn't seem like RE Engine. Especially considering the fact that it's not labeled on it. Wonder if this will play like the original, that would be a bonus
Same voice as RE2R?
Is nothing sacred?!?!?!
“Excuse me sir, I’m looking for the girl in this photograph.”
Will it be released on ps4?
Small world eh?
You guys; I don't know why do you have more respect and love to that PS5. Is this going to be also on PS4 or just on PS5?
your right hand comes off?
Am I truly the only person that hates RE:4
I wonder how much theyre going to cut, censor and remove
Is this exclusive?
Why couldn't they just PER-FECT the RE3 REMAKE before moving onto 4? RE3 REMAKE is OKAY at best. It's trash compared to 2 Remake.
Is capcom remaking until number 6???
Seems like this remake goes more in depth on Leon's character. Gonna look forward to this.  P/S : Is that Saddler's voice in 1:33? Seems a bit different, like a younger version of his.
What are we thinking, will this be another RE:make2, or more of an RE:make3 experience? We getting a full adaptation or just a small taste. Since they aren't reusing so many assets and maps, also because this is designed for next gen hardware, my guess is this is gonna be closer to re2 remake
I wonder if every resident evil is just gonna get a remake, doubtful but I'd still think it would be cool.
Where'd everybody go? Bingo?
Is a time exclusive for ps5 ?
2:12 what? Not coming to ps4?
Will they change the opening where Leon breaks into someone's home and murders an innocent man trying to defend himself from a home invader?
Is this exclusive to ps5?
Does the very end of this suggest we might be able to play using the RE 1, 2, 3 camera angles?
"Whuddya buyin'?" -Uhh, this game!
I wonder what’ll happen if they ever make it to 5.
I don’t know man, it looks rather claustrophobic? Maybe that’s the point but the environment looks cramped
There's no ps4 version?..
Who else is keen to buy this new version of Resident Evil 4 at least 6 more times over the next few years?
Biggest question of all does Ashley do something useful?
why make new games if remakes give as much money!? ugh...
Where is everyone going..?
Is this exclusive or pc and other platforms also ?
Why didn't they use Paul Mercier's voice again?
Capcom run out of ideas?
I swear they make a resident evil 4 each year or am I tripping
Can capcom stop with the remakes and gives an actual new leon game  I really miss the dude
Why did they change Ada Wongs dress? Can you please make that at least a downloadable content because I really don't like the outfit you used on her out of Resident Evil 6.
Couldn't they just go back and fix the RE3 Remake?
Now here's the big question...is Leon gonna get Luis's name right this time?
But can I play it with a WiiMote?
Is that RE2 Remake's Leon voice actor?
Pet peeve... Leon's outfit looks mad baggy
Didn't we already get a resident evil 4 remastered? I lost track...
I thought resident evil was made by Namco?
Does this mean we are getting a code Veronica remake? Seems silly to make an RE5 remake...But if you're going to redo all of them...might as well, maybe fix 6?
Idk. Re4 wasn't old enough for me to want a remake... I would have loved a remake of Resident evil X code Veronica
What number are we at now? The resident evil franchise might be the most confusing chronology in gaming other than final fantasy.
What are you selling?
was that Mendes in the hallway
Does anyone know if it will be available to play on Xbox consoles?
What have they done !!! His jacket collar is folded down ….. this is already off to a bad start, collar up please fix this asap
I don't want to nitpick, but...Could they, this time, make the spanish enemies speak actual "Spain-Spanish" and not mexican?      No es que me importe demasiado, pero daba mucho el cante...
But why?
RE4 as a horror game? Color me interested.
I wonder how Ashley's scream this time will be like.
With each remake i keep wondering if they ll ever do one for 5 and 6? Could u imagine a complete overhaul into actual horror? Id love to see what those games could become and actually stand on par with the rest of the series. I also wouldnt mind a re-remake of 1 but for now im just hyped for RE4
i wonder when theyll stop with all these remakes, maybe re5...??? idk i highly doubt theyll go all the way to a re6 remake
Am dreaming right?
Will there be more new contact available for PS4?
Another remake! Whats this, remake number 4 of the same game?
Why is the bit at 0:46 live action?
Am I the only one who feels like this is a terrible idea? The original was a masterpiece and I feel like this one is just going to ruin it. Remakes of 2 and 3 were understandable, because those games came out at the dawn of 3d gaming. But Re4 HD edition is still a fantastic game that holds up to this day.
Was that Claire? I know obviously Ashley, but u meant early on in the trailer
Why don't they just make a new game?! Re4 got real stupid, real fast. The last 80% of that game is ducking garbage. 🗑
any chance of ps4 port?
Remake again?   Well let's see  Hope it's not heavily cut like Re 3
I wonder if we’re going to have any things added to the game from the original, like the suplex or the kick
RE4 VR is my favourite version so far, curious if this'll be better than it.
Still weird to me that they're skipping Code Veronica, arguably the entry in the franchise that could've most benefitted from a full remake.
Is it on ps4 ??!
Seems way to serious. Where is that classic RE4 humor? :(
Why are his pants so baggy
will it be exclusive to ps5?
Is it just going to be on the ps5?
Will this be on the ps4?
I don’t understand. I thought Leon was supposed to be Mexican?
IS this only PS5 exclusive?
Will it be released for PS4?
ME: SO GUYS "WHAT'RE YA BUYIN?"  EVERYONE: "AH! I'LL BUY IT AT A HIGH PRICE!"
Visions of “What’d ya buying?”
Ps5 only ?
Dunno thinking RE 4 will look like a downgrade of 8. Rather had 1 redone like 2 and 3.
Playable in VR2??
Will it be available to play on ps4?
Resident Evil 4 does not need a remake but okay… how about Re5 next? Then 6? 7? 8?
PS5 only or pc too?
Real question is if Ashley is still has her ballistic system.
Looks awesome, but why is Leon still so young? Idk if Paul Mercier is still in the business, but at least bring back Matthew Mercer...
What about the Village DLC tho? I mean, it would make sense to bring it out before RE4 😅
They gave Luis Serra a French accent?
Is this going be done with fixed camera angles? Or is it still going to be a third person game?
Is this ps5 only?
Is it a remake or a remaster???
Why?. Just why
Whats the point of remaking a near perfect game?
Am i seeing right, is that claire?
The best game in the series is getting a remake that might improve it even more, how is that possible?
Ps5 only? Figures 😢 looks great though
What!!!!!?
Is it for playstation 5 only or xbox too?
What’s the point of a RE4 remake? Y’all might as well give us a resident evil 5 remake after this lol
Will come to pc right?
why not for PS4? 😭
I love that they are making all these Resident Evil remakes, but could you PLEASE make a Dino Crisis remake Capcom?!?  I can’t be the only one that’s wants to see that game remade!
Ps5 only? O will it be available for pc also?
No for ps4?😢
Why is leon not as cool looking as the original?
Does anyone else thing Ashley looks like the Sphere Hunter
What is this uneasy feeling
So is this gonna be a ps5 exclusive?
Will it be available on the ps4?
Hmmmmmmmmmmm well if this disappoints, it’s not like there isn’t 500 versions of OG resi 4 to choose from
What are you buying? on march 24
is this exclusive to PlayStation?
No PS4 version?
More Butcha-U content? Yes, please
3rd person or fps view ?
Where's Code Veronica
I wonder how much is Capcom going to censor this game
how can you enhance THE RE4?....stranger
Interested but worried, cuz how can you top perfection. Also where's code veronica x remake?
1 questions.  Can I look underneath 😆
Who else remembers growing up with this game on ps2?
Resident Evil 4 Remake is back?! Like the remade of the original of Resident Evil 4 2005? Okay. But I’m a fan of remake video games of Resident Evil so was Mafia 1 too
Why does this need to exist?
Only on ps5?? What about ps4?
Loooks like ps2 graphics. Zamnn! What happened here?
What's the point of a RE4 Remake if they're gonna make Ashley less ballistic-y?
What'r you sellin?  What'r you buyin?
Will this come to PC?
1:59 Ashley ?
Where was un forastero ?!?!?!
So ....does this mean 5 and 6 could get remade?? I feel like if they do they should do an reimagining in addition to a remake
I know this is a Playstation game but is it going to be on X-Box Series X and S too?
dude why this terrible graphics ????!!! in this game!!??? capcom ???
tired of remakes, got anything else?
Where's everyone going? Bingo?
were there any news about re8 dlc ?
NOW DO I PLAY THE ORIGINAL BEFORE THIS OR WAIT FOR THIS TO DROP?!
Did they change Leon's voice actor again? It's been a while, but that doesn't sound like Nick Apostolides to me.  If it's not the same voice actor, it's very annoying Capcom can't keep consistency with its voice actors.
A little rough don't you think?
They gave Ashley blue eyes now?
Show gameplay or no buy!
WHAT ARE YOU BUYING?  This game?
Will it be on PS4, especially because a PS5 is just as common as a mammoth
Is it the same leon actor from resident evil 2?😭
Is it only gonna be on ps5?
Is it only for playstation
I wonder what kind of pantsu she will have. Either way she cute.
Is it coming to PC?
Now the bigger question….. is there a chainsaw fight in it? If there is I’m out lol
How about a little overtime?
Wonder how much they'll cut from the original game...
No ps4?
