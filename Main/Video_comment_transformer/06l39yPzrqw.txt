I smell a bike trip from southern California to Baja! Ammeyeright? 😅😅😅
What type of bike is it? Who is the manufacturer?
Have you been to the Corn Palace in Mitchell SD? If not you need to stop and check it out.
Kara and Nate I was beginning to wonder if or when y’all were going to be getting back in the van
Rick and Beck?????!!!!!! So excited to see what's coming next for you guys!😄
I question the posibility of securing front row center seats for Aele only a few hours before the concert. I realize you guys are prining you own money  but to waste $10,000 on something you are already enjoying on CD astounds me.
Do you nit need a drop vent for the propane box?
🍁 I would like to know how do you know about blue’s clues?
Can I ask what / if you guys consider the environmental impact of the planes you take ? Not to be mean or to judge, just out of interest :)

Do y'all exercise on long drive days? How do you not feel all tight and uncomfortable?!
I think we are still in Kansas? Lol, I miss home. Go Ft. Hays State Tigers 😊
Why don’t you mount the solar panels onto a hinged frame that covers the decking.  Then on the odd occasion you want to use the decking just lift the panel up. Plus you can optimise it for the sun.
What’s the rv park near circus circus called
anyone else from missouri that gets excited when they travel through it????
You’re doing what?….
I wonder if Kara has been homesick and is at a point in life where she still wants to travel, still wants adventure, but also wants the comfort of family, friends and home (aka the U.S.). It broke my heart when you announced no more van life, but maybe possibly perhaps in the future. I wasn't ready to see you leave, although I have LOVED all of your videos since then. I feel like you are back home and I'm here for it!
Do these ppl have no jobs?
I’m confused still what blue’s clues had to do with anything?
Netflix has a different library based on your location?
Random question does anybody know the brand of sweater Nate’s wearing at 16:35

Is there any chance that your next adventure is thru hiking the PCT trail or something? Cuz if it is i will loose my shit cuz i have been waiting for u guys to do that for sooo long
Oceanside California? That's where my family vacations every now and then, fun to see it on a Kara and Nate video.
Where can we find the video of Nate and his grandfather?
Kara do you truly like Van life or not? I feel your recent videos are lacking excitement and are too long. The bike ride sounds dull, as you have other bike rides.
Was the concert in the sphere?
Kara! Where is that adorable colorful stripe white jacket and pants set from!?
Is it really back to van life? I bet money your going to do another bike trip…!
Am I imagining things or was Nate in the thumbnail and now Kara’s in the thumbnail?
Will you guys do a meet up again anytime soon? You guys want to Las Vegas and I would love to meet you since I live there. I have been a fan of yours since 2016.
Are y’all going to post updates at where your going to be biking through? I would love to see if you possibly would pass through my town!
I don't get all the suspense, people who have been following you guys on Instagram, knows what's up
Love you guys!!!! Gotta ask one question: How in the world did you get away with recording IN a casino? They are VERY against any photos/filming inside their premises. BTW: You were in my town, Las Vegas!!!
33:01 OptiVolt has solar panels AND coffee to send you?!?!  Are they a company founded for only supplying @KaraandNate when they are van-lifing? Because that's what their business model seems to be. 🤣☕🌞⛅
What about Mav? I guess he’ll be riding in one of the vans 🚐?

Do you have an update on the goal to visit every state? Will you tick off some more on this journey?

Kara and Nate have you named the van yet? I feel it is only fitting to name her “Adele” now that you have actually seen Adele in concert while traveling in her!
I physically and audibly gagged at the grey water plug. Hubs is wondering why.
Does your van have a crack in the wind shield ?
I’ve been a fan for years now. I was wondering how yall pass the time while driving. And wondering if you have thought of starting a podcast of you driving. Or even a patreon?  Love you guys. Thanks for all your hard work.

Kara, what LLBean jacket are you wearing in the van?  Love it!
Do you guys ever just stay in USA and just take it easy for a few weeks ?
Would you ever consider a van remodel now that you're using it again? Maybe to replace the shower with more practical storage or a small seating area, or to add a bed loft that you don't have to set up/tear down with storage underneath?

Pacific NW? That’s my guess!

Love the van videos, will you ever be buying a newer one though? And build it yourself?  It would be an amazing series to watch, although a bit pricey.

What's with all the Nate-hate for the Show-me state??? 😂 hello from STL!
You were in CO again and I missed yall?!!?!?!
I'd forgotten how fun the state crossings were! :)  Are you going to get a chance to see the Eclipse on the 14th?
Curious - are y'all driving the bike from DC to the Atlantic Ocean or are you just going to dip it in the Potomac River and call it a day? 😅

Quick question for the European viewers: Can anyone pinpoint Kara's "british" accent to a specific area or is it just an odd amalgamation?? Lol love ya Kara 😋
