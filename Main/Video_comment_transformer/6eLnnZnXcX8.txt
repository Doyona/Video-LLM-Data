Who's ready for 2026
Anyone 2025 new year's eve?
Listening To This Song Again in December 2024 Brings Some Nostalgic Feeling...Is This A Sad Song Cos Am In Tears?
Never knowing he's astray
Hope happy new year and little things are added to VOYAGE show at festive season  ?.
Feet of clay , always knowing he's astray,  keeps on going anyway  ?.
I just Wondered If the title was called Mama Mia 3 Thank you for the music this song Happy new year will be Excellent in the end of the movie with all the people get together to celebrate the new year celebration and please could we found out who is Sophie's dad is we didn't know who it was ?
When is the album out
Just came across this beautiful song how old is it.
Wait they still exist
I've never knew is that party scene was related to a new year party on what, because is the same scene for the Super-Trouper's album cover
Never knowing he's astray
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
Never knowing he's astray
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
always wondered why they didnt release this as a single in the uk at the end of 1980  such an amazing song
And what about the live show they promised for 2022? Was it just a promise, fake news? / E quanto ao show ao vivo que eles prometeram para 2022? Foi só promessa, fake news?
*Who can say what we’ll find?*
