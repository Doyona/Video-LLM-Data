13:10 whats the name of this song?
Like i don't even understand how ONE artist is supposed to be able to...ruin music? I mean it's music?? Literally anything is allowed and if you don't like something just don't listen to it? I could easily say that german rap ruined music charts here in germany simply because i absolutely despise most songs of that genre but I can also just choos to ignore it and listen to the music I like.  That's the beauty of music, isn't it? The VARIETY. Something you personally don't like might be someone else's favourite song.
Uuuuuh but Tpain is a real singer...? Have you not heard his voice without auto tune?!
Why are people sensitive nowadays
Honestly- why does it matter how you get to the music? Like if it sounds good then what does it matter??
How can T Pain ruin something when the audience is the one who reacted and loved it ?? Usher is confused
What I wanna know is; the song Usher & R'Kelly collab'd on, 'Same Girl', considering what Kellz is currently locked up for, shouldn't we be asking some questions?
Are you gonna talk about the downfall of frenemies? Or is that just a big no thank you? 🤔
Music is so broad though, you’d think there’s enough room for people to have their own styles of doing R&B and I feel like Auto tune isn’t new??? Don’t LOTS OF ARTIST USE IT!????
Even live performances are often pitch corrected these days. They used to lip sync but now they got these new mics that basically correct your pitch as you are singing live. You really think people are dancing and singing, while mainaining a vocal quality that makes it sound like they're literally in the recording booth? Breathing wise, singing is hard enough while just standing still, imagine doing cardio on top of that. You cannot sing and dance without sounding like you're singing while dancing.
Omg why did you have to play a clip of an Adele song now I'm gonna be on a binge singing along with her... for literal days.
Music is literally subjective. How could one man simply ruin music lmao 🤣
wait, did d'angelo really just forget about things like "i dont love you anymore"/"i want a divorce"/"you have terminal cancer" cause those are super effective 5 words or less sentences that give plenty of people depression >.>
The background music sounds like music from The Untamed? Am I the only one hearing it?
didn't we cancel a guy for not liking Shrek?
Melodyne can preserve vibrato and inflections at this point. You don't know whether you're hearing pitch correction or not anymore. It doesn't make music it worse, it just makes it different. Music is not a competition, there shouldn't be anything wrong with going for the exact sounds you're looking for.
Waiit is D'Angelo an undercover prolific producer bc why tf did he have all that knowledge? LOL
Bro why do people even care about auto tune why can’t we just enjoy the music?
T-Pain x D'Angelo twitch stream when?
has usher heard of sub genres???
Wait, what?
Is that Serenade of Water in the background。。。? 👀👀👀👂🦻👂🦻
Whats that shamir song 13:22
You can pitch correct live performances now… Adele sounds amazing but like she could still be pitch corrected if she’s using a mic
Is that hoodie your merch??? 👀👀👀
Did he have the same conversation with Bieber?
T-pain? Usher? What year is this?! Lol
What if Usher was told by publishers or whoever bankrolled him that he had to do the autotune stuff when he didn't want to because of T Pain's success? Tinfoil sadness hat.
How is Usher not being the one canceled over this.
D'angelo why'd you have to mention that song from the Lego movie, I just got it out of my head 3 months ago 🤣
Lol why is anyone blaming artists and not record labels and audio software companies who spend the money to market and popularize trends and audio effects like auto-tune.
But like can we discuss T-Pain’s ACTUAL singing voice…. Because it’s absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!
how does one "ruin music" anyway?
Idk why this reminded me of hot tub streams
If people wanted to cancelled everyone for auto tune so why only one singer? We should cancel every singer...
Doesn't usher use like auto tune all the time?
As you was listing artists I was sitting here just like, "WHAT ABOUT KHALID? SYD? ANDERSON .PAAK? BRYSON TILLER? I mean Tank still make music too." WTF are these people DEAF? Protect T-PAIN at ALL COSTS.
Why did I only just realise it was transparent soul and not transparaside? What is transparaside? XD
U S H E R ?   The sweaty shoplifter?   The man who threw fake money with his picture on it … Usher Bucks … at a strip club?  Whatever, Usher. You’re gross.
…are people really mad at tpain.. seriously are yall just now hearing of him cus hes been using autotune for years! Whys this an issue 😤
Music is subjective so either way I don't think a singular person could mess up the music industry as a whole
I'm sorry, but was Usher singing 'Im on a boat'? I don't think so, bro needs to take a moment to appreciate T-God
someone pls greatly improve my life by telling me what song Shamir is singing at 13:22- or what video d'angelo pulled that from omg
bruh where can i buy that hoodie?
Isn’t T-pain a fan of Gus Johnson? T-pain is aYouTube watcher there’s no doubts he’s gonna see this
Isn't this litterally what people got mad at him for back in his prime as if that wasn't just his gimmick?
#41 on trending? move it to #1
Didn’t usher contract aids and then not tell any girl he had sex with after knowing?
ok but, can I please get a curated, D'Angelo approved spotify playlist?
Is he wearing bee-angelo merch?
didnt usher use auto tune on his song OMG tho ???  edit: yea i was right LMAOOO.
Willow Smith still exists in music??
Does anyone know what the background music is from in D’Angelo’s videos on this channel?
who are those two random artists ? never seen them in my life crazy .. anyways 🤪
look at how metal singers deepthroat the mic to get a different sound with their voice, the voice is an instrument
Cancel T-pain?    Nope.
Quick question did Usher have the same energy for The Dream??
Did no one see he won that masked singer show? He did so many different genres and sang acapella. It was amazing.
Will you be talking about creepshow art?
Hello? Have y’all seen the Tom and jerry movie? Dude, this is t-pain’s thing 🤔
Yet there's a whole 20 minute video of the man singing without autotune?
people don't know what autotune is
I'm just confused because he pronounced it "banGer" instead of "baNGer". Have I been pronouncing it wrong?
Is that a joke bro??? People cancelling T-Pain?????
Wasn't that like T-pains thing? 🤦‍♀️
Okay but why did that song got stuck in my head tho?🤦🏾‍♀️
hold up Mr. Wallace are you married? I see that ring on your ring finger on the left hand O_O
Is the secret channel for a cult? 🙋 Count me in
Usher really? The man who made art pieces such as "yeah yeah yeah" and "OMG im so in love"? I love t-pain and he's singing is straight up beautiful but the autotune was a style choice and i wasn't really bothered about it.
bruh it’s just music listen to what you find good tf?
Who is Usher?
people "learn the difference between pitch correction for note accuracy vs. autotune as a vocal effect" challenge: failed
can you PLEASE perhaps do more videos on music things? i love how you talk about it so much! only if it tickles your fancy though obviously
T__T ugh poor T Pain, fuck usher that shit was cruel.  Good songs are subjective. Some people like T Pain, are we saying they're definitively wrong? Because I don't think anyone can really say that? And like you said, a few shitty songs doesn't mean good songs cease to be created.   I feel bad he went through this for 4 years ._.
ok but why does D'Angelo Wallace have a REALLY REALLY good taste in music???
If the song sounds good who cares, idk why some people think that just because it’s not to ones personal preference it’s now deemed bad or less then another song or style of music
who's y'all???
No but why do I still blast that Cher song in my car when I wasn’t even born when it came out 😅 like I just heard it one day and was like THIS SLAPS 😅
I'm sorry but doesn't litterally every singer who shares music use auto-tune? People are so BOREDDD
I just want to know who I can give my money to for that hoodie. I need it asap.
My mouth dropped when he asked if we have seen Usher lately
He can sing without the autotune but chooses to use it to make cool effects on his sound for art, like what is Usher’s issue? It isn’t as if T-pain has a bad voice and was using it to sound like a completely different person. He sounds great with or without, like he needs to just chill. T-Pain legit seems so nice too
Did anyone else have the TPain autotune mic from years back???
smh... people really coming after tpain after what he did for music??? the man can ACTUALLY SING. the auto tune was just a plus.
Does anyone know what song Griff is singing at 13:07?
are they really cancelled if you have to explain what's going on?
But are these haters forgetting that T-pain can ACTUALLY sing?!?!
Didn't Usher also knowingly pass on STI's to sexual partners without disclosing that information?
Why is auto-tune always immediately seen as a negative in the music industry music is music my guys, gals and non-binary pals deal with it😔
At one point autotune began to be very annoying and frustrating not just because of it was overused but because it was done badly. Did I blame it on T Pain? Hello NO! Sounds like Usher was sour for something and he scapegoated T Pain. Dbag move!
Didn't he use auto tune to get a talk box effect???
Am I the only one who’s never seen anyone cancelling him
Hot take with peace and love: Why not just not pitch correct? Just sing. I love THAT sound. It’s all good though, do whatever you want. 😊👍
T-Pain slander AGAIN?!? Haven't we all agreed he has an amazing voice and the autotune thing was plain harassment? Can we get new discourse please?
Am I the only one who remembers NB Ridaz?
I loooovvveee your sweatshirt,,, it’s so cute,,,where did you get it? 🥺
How tf do you wake someone up just to insult them??? What was the thought process there???
Rashida was in that T-Pain music video!?!?
When are people going to realize how trash Usher is?
can we talk about how you got those musical clips in there with no copyright!!!
WTF? I thought it was already well known that T-Pain heavily uses Auto-Tune, to the extent that he made popular a certain use of it. Trying to cancel T-Pain for Auto-Tune is like trying to cancel Tom Hanks for acting.
Usher? Aint that the guy from the boondocks?
Why do I keep thinking about the chocolate rain guy while watching this video? 😬
“Y’all” is such an over exaggeration in this context. Who are all of these people to warrant “y’all”? Because the only people I have seen “cancelling” him have been people that have been upset about things he’s said in regards to his wife (his weird Instagram joke) and working with Tory Lanez.   People and their feelings about auto tune is subjective, just like his opinion on Aaliyah. 🤷🏾‍♀️
Not here for the music drama. Just want to know when and where we can get those B’Angelo sweaters.
I just want to know where I can get this sweater 😭😭
has usher HEARD t pain sing without autotune??
If people want to use auto tune then who cares?? It’s just another artistic choice. Let him make the music he likes to make.
Ok but why is no one talking about D‘Angelo‘s hoodie?! Little B’Angelo and clouds,,, truly beautiful
Have these n*ggas not actually hear T-pain sing? He’s honestly good, screw Twitter for this
What about The Master Roger Troutman and Zapp
whyd you not credit sideways' autotune video lol
So did the BeeGees ruin music because they decided to sing in a higher register? Lol Usher trippin
May present to Usher mumble rap?
Autotune sounds good, change my mind
Who the hell is T-pain and who is Usher
how is usher going to say t-pain ruined music when he had fuckin WILL-I-AM, an autotuned musician, on one or two of his songs?? make it make sense...he's just ugly and bitter, and seeing t-pain betrayed and heartbroken hurt me 💔 that man is one of those responsible for my childhood, tf
Seriously? T-pain popularized auto tune and he’s getting canceled for it years later? Get outta here…
Autotune literally is his brand??? I remember I used to have a t-pain autotune app in like 2010...
Are you wearing merch sir? Because we need that.
But didn't Usher do a lot of auto-tune songs too back in the day? Like didn't he even literally do one 'with' t-pain??
Is this a transition video into D’angelo’s music career?
So are ppl gonna blame lil Wayne too cause he abused auto tune to the max. At least tpain can sing and rap. Which he’s proven. He hasn’t ruined anything he just popularized something that exists.
Wait I already watched the video but um btw can you you tell what the application they use when they say "They don't use autotune but they do refine their voice"
Great video as always, but can we just take a moment to acknowledge how soft D'Angelo looks here
Wasn’t that usher song hella old though?
You obviously know a bit about music production 👍 Future project incoming? 🕵️‍♂️♥️
Also like the use of auto tune isn't bad? Like icons like Sophie and Charli XCX use it in a beautiful way!!! and they're GREAT
Yo where did you get that hoodie? Fucking adorable
I don't get this. If people think someone ruined music by their style, why copy them??? It's not like T-Pain put a gun on their head and said only use autotune like how do people even justify that? Same is with mumble rap nowadays. If you think it destroys hip hop (which it kinda did tbh), just ignore it and do your lyrical shit. Why you wanna go by the trend and copy something you feel is crap? No matter how bad one side of music is, it can never cancel out the good side. I think it all comes down to being famous and clout chasing nowadays, people don't wanna be original.
Have y'all ever heard T-Pain sing without the autotune? Voice of an angel!
10:30 whats the cher song called? Believe?
Where'd you get that hoodie it looks so soft!?
Okay but wasn’t Ne-Yo always better anyways..?
Is this a joke cause whenever I look up the name nothing comes up except this channel. Someone help
petion for new art videos may it be a challenge or a speed paint i love your art
Kids these days be like "what's a t- pain?"
but for real, who were those two small singers? they sounded really good
(psst verb bars are really great, I just had to cut frivolous spending) Also if he released an ANIMAL CROSSING SONG? I must pause for research purposes.
I personally dont like the sound of autotune but i wouldnt go as far as saying he ruined music????
are we gonna talk about that hoodie?
Why do people that are actually horrible get a free pass? Then people like tpain who helped create Low one of the greatest gifts ever to the world are shut out.
I don't want to negate from this video because it's very important and TPain deserves all the love in the world, but I'm so curious: what is the background music in D'Angelo's video? Is it from BOTW?
Music is subjective. I really don’t understand why people go after it for the sound. If you don’t like it, don’t listen and move on maybe? The only time I can understand being upset about a song is if the content is questionable (looking at you blurred lines) but otherwise, just find stuff you like and try to enjoy things sometimes.
Where have you been??? We need more content
This breaks my heart bc Tpain is so talented and also super kind. I wonder if Usher having his own music popularity starting to decline made him lash out at Tpain. Don't gete wrong, Usher is talented af and has been behind a lot of iconic music, but his own records haven't had the same draw as in the past so I wonder if he wanted a reason that wasn't on him.
Who put Usher in charge? I never approved that.
(I'm not done watching the video as I comment this) didn't T-pain use autotune to replicate the effects of one of those talk-box things? Like he didn't RUIN music, but he definitely changed it.
I personally despise autotune but would I disrespect an artist like that over using it? No, tf
he,,,has been singing with autotune for literal years and now its a problem?? Twitter really is full of nutcases
People are canceling someone over auto-tune when there are millionaires from Tik Tok who just lip sing and do stupid dances, I- what? 💀
People care that much about t pain?
Who is Usher? Never heard of him💅
Did we just get willow smithed?
Every studio recorded song heavily relies on autotune to save time and money. Do you know how many takes, even the best singers need to get the pitch perfect throughout the song?
i feel so bad bc i didnt know who t pain was until now and im so confused bc hes literally so talented?? how tf did i miss him do i live under a rock???
So when are we getting an auto tune tier-list?
Is no one gonna talk about how when he captioned “2 random small artists” he showed the weekend and Ariana grande
13:53 wow does anybody know who these indie artists are? they're actually not bad, i hope they get more popular
is there a list of songs or artists mentioned in the video? since I don't know music
I don't get it, there are lots of singers that use autotune. Plus there's nothing wrong with autotune, unless they're using so much that the song  almost sounds like a robot sang it (ahem Jake Paul)
Me personally I don’t like T-pain but really?? Over auto tune?? I- 🤚🏽💀
y’all i need HELP where does D’Angelo get his amazing hoodies someone drop the link plz😌
Can someone please tell me what FKA Twigs song that was?
Am I tripping? Did The D'Angelo Wallace post a video on a SUNDAY?!
If you got spotify D'Angelo, mind sharing your playlist? Curious of your taste in music :)
how does T-Pain using autotune corelates with declining of R&B music?? wth is these people on? I swear people got too much time on their hands today.
What FKA twigs song was that? ~13:10
am I the only one who couldn't stop looking at the dot at. the left bottom of his lip????
Doesn't everyone use auto-tune like it's not that big of a deal fr getting mad for nothing might as well just cancel music and whoever makes such a disgrace of it
Tpain... without autotune? Now I can feeel t pain 😀😀😀😀
okay but- people need to realise that he's not the only one that normalised autotune 🤨 did everybody suddenly forget abt kanye west ???
what has the world come to
So what was that Griff song he put a video of?
Wonder how many people in this conflated autotune with pitch correction.
Why t pain???  Why not people like 69 that ruined music????
Why does he need 3 YouTube channels? Do you get more money per channel? I dont get why youtubers create multiple different channels
Ok but are we going to ignore the fact that he woke up T pain JUST to tell him that he ruined music, like he couldn't have waited until after the plane landed or at least until after he woke up?
Did anyone else try the promo verbenergy link and not be able to make it work? It all works until payment method...
its the same thing over and over, why are ppl spending more time piling on hate on ppl they claim are "ruining" smth instead of using it to support ppl who produce/ perform things you love?
Did Usher just get pissed he was left in the office flipping copies while T-Pain was on a boat in his flippy floppies?
Music is too subjective to ever be classified as good or bad(What might be right for you, might not be right for some), and no one persons type of musical preference or style can "ruin" said industry.
Who’s usher?
In that same vein, I think a lot of people give Vocaloid producers crap, in regards to how they tune them? Even fabricated voices can be made to have emotion and a "soul" behind them because of their producers, and I think it can get overlooked a lot when it comes to "what sounds right."
Doesn't Usher use a lot of autotune?
Y'all tryna act like we didn't bop T-pain and Lil Wayne????
He getting heat for Auto-tune again? Leave that man alone...
do people still listen to usher?
How’s everyone bashing T-Pain for autotune after praising Kanye for 808 and heartbreaks? Make it make sense
Idk why people think autotune can save atrocious singing. Autotune smooths out a couple of notes that are off-pitch, not make a bad singer amazing.
How'd this not get throttled by YouTube's shitty flagging for music clips?
Is he the guy that rhymed mansion with Wisconsin i love him
Can we realize that because one person starting something doesn't mean others have to follow suit?
whats the song/performance called from shamir
just because you don't like an aspect of an artists music doesn't mean they've ruined music. just. don't listen to their music if you hate it so much. like?? just listen to somebody else???
Usher? He's still around?
When and where can I get this hoodie?
Wait why is D’Angelo boring now
Why am I only just now noticing your cheekbones omg
Y’all just missed the Tory Lanez thing then?
what about Cher?  she's a legend.
who is y’all 😭❓
Have these people never heard of using auto tune as a stylistic choice to enhance the song? ya some people do use it to smooth over their vocals but it’s pretty obvious who uses it as stylistic choice and who uses it to cover up a bit... anyway this hate is so stupid
"am I the only one that likes how auto tune sounds?"  Of course not, I mean artists like Dorian Electra have decently massive followings using the auto tuned sound. And I know you're a fan of Dorian like me.  I do get annoyed though with the "they don't need auto tune they can actually sing" people though. Like yeah? so what? they want it, let others be happy.
Has Usher heard his own music? He might want to look at himself before going after T-Pain
Anyone know where his hoodie is from?
Is the background music D'Angelo uses from .hack//sign? Damn, talk about a hot track from the past.
What's wrong with autotune, though?? I mean, I listen to Vocaloid so I'm used to robotic sounding voices.
Why was there a random willow smith promo it here 😂 I mean I’m here for it I love her but it was funny how you just slid that in and moved forward 🤣🤣
didn't they trash 808S and heartbreak by Kanye west because of his use of auto tune during the time
What about ushers song OMG  Oh oh oh oh oh .... that was full of auto tune?
Have you ever seen Sideways' video on Pitch correction and auto tune?
Was that a Willow Smith ad in there?
Anybody remember his app, I Am T-Pain?
IS THAT MERCH I SEE??
what song of fka twiggs is that?
which fka twigs song was that?
Why did usher decide to be an asshole that day?
Do people not realize T Pain's use of auto tune is a stylistic choice? They really think he does that cuz he can't sing??
Your skin is glowing, when do we get a "my morning routine video" from you 😁 I'd watch it ✋ (sorry for the out of context message) 😅
Unrelated but HOW are you so pretty
Where did you get your great sweatshirt?
Me who listens to vocaloid: Is this some sort of "real singer" joke I'm too robotic to understand?
So is Tpain an abuser apologist and/or an abuser himself? Cause that's the info I've been getting from black twitter
where can I get that hoodie?! It looks awesome!
no ads? copyright?
whats that fka twigs song
What if this video is a hint & the new channel is for music
where exactly is ushers npr tinny desk??? oh ok nevermind...
Where is the sweatshirt from, it’s pretty cool and looks comfy✨
WHAT cher was the first the use autotune????and in one of my favorite songs??
Taylor Swift even uses autotune during her concerts but for T-Pain it’s not okay? 😂 At least he uses it as a stylized thing and not to tweak his weak voice.
Ummmmm I thought him using auto tune was his whole gig
But where is the playlist with all these amazing artists? I need more, but where do I start?
what is D'Angelo's background music with the flute? It's killing me tryna remember. I think it's from a video game?
Wether you think auto tune is bad or not but have you heard him sing without it? His voice is wonderful!
Ain’t it late to complain about auto-tune supposedly “ruining” music for singers when we’ve had a thriving scene for literal software singing songs for legit years? I guess they knew they didn’t have the clout to say anything about Hatsune Miku…
Who else thinks the secret project could involve music?
How does usher fit on plane with a head that big.
Wait usher is mad cuz he used autotune?  You mean like he did in the song ya? Hmm
Excuse me?! His real singing voice is, ANGELIC- who cares if he uses auto tune for effect. Protect t-pain at all costs 😤
Anyone know what that FKA Twigs clip is from?
Dangelo is this just covering yourself for your birthday song to ethan? ;)
can we talk about dangelo’s camera quality
Whats the griff song??
Who is that/what is that song at 15:15?
What kind of flight attendant wakes up a 1st class passenger at the request of another passenger? I would flip out and become a Karen monster getting her reported.
Does anyone know where to get his sweatshirt?? It looks so good!
Didn’t Usher use autotune too? 🤔
why does it matter if theres auto tune if you like the song lol if you dont vibe with it then skip and listen to something else ?? nbd
How come when you mentioned Verb Energy I thought a solar energy company sponsored you
How is it that D'Angelo looks younger than he did almost 2 years ago
Was that Rasheeda in T-pains video???? 🔥
*two small artists idk* 🥲
Didn't usher SA a girl or a few?
Is D’Angelo planning on overthrowing the government or something?
not d'angelo calling weeknd and ari two random artists... i mean who are they xD
Did your background change. Or have I just not watched your videos in a while
What is the internet at this point.
????? T-Pain had some real good songs. Twitter really losing it.
idk if this is related but sugarcrash anyone?
Can somebody please help: Is the music in the background of this video some kind of video game soundtrack? It sounds so familiar!
What is this nonsense?
As a digital artist, I use a lot of tools to help transform my artwork to see it how I originally imagined. If a musical artist does the same with auto tune, who am I to judge?
What should I do when I finish watching your videos on both channels
If people were going to care about this, why now and not like... Fifteen years ago?
can you turn on subtitles pls?
Idk the idea the music became more accessible to average sounding people isn't bad. It's like a rich person getting mad more people are getting rich
is anyone else wondering about d'angelo's thoughts on the creepshow art/lolcow/emily artful situation? obviously he doesn't have to comment on it if he doesn't want to, but I was just curious about his thoughts on it since he was one of the people shannon singled out and talked trash about on lolcow.
Hey D'Angelo! I was wondering if you accepted fan art, I made some for you while playing this video!! <3
i wonder how usher would feel about vocaloid
don’t people have better things to do
So nobody gonna comment the fact that 13:47 is actually "Save Your Tears" by The Weeknd & Ariana Grande?
great video!! anyone know the music in the background, i’ve been wondering for like 2 days 😓
what happened to usher? this is the first time ive heard of him in like months??!!
Isn't cancelling T-Pain for using autotune like cancelling 2 Chainz for using chains? Like cancelling Muhammed Ali for using boxing gloves? Like cancelling Nelson Muntz for using "HEH HEH" ?
omg were half of these twitter dumdums even alive when tpain was super popular? i remember in highschool everyone freaked out over the tpain autotune iphone app.
“How is she a real person?” Me, every time I hear Tatiana from Jinjer.
do they not realize that a shit ton of popular celebs use auto tune?
I thought Cher was the first one to use auto tune in music? Or Britney too?
Where’s usher now? The last I heard of him he was in scary movie so I think T Pain is winning
Damn where can I get that hoodie
We all know that he uses auto tune. How can you cancel someone for something they aren't trying to hide. I'm so sick of cancel culture
We’re still talking about T Pain and auto tune? Is it 2008? People need to leave T Pain alone, he seems like a nice dude. And I don’t care what anyone says, Buy U a Drank is still a banger.
Does anyone want D’Angelo to make a playlist on Spotify of all his favorite songs because he has some good taste
Like?? Is digital art not real art? If it’s not, then looks like we gotta throw out our tablets, if only traditional is acceptable
why does everybody hate auto-tune so much its dumb. like they’re making music for your ears to hear thats all that matters
Didn't Sideways make a video about something like this? Something about auto-tune and pitch correction it's really good watch it
what’s that fka twigs performance at 13:17 called?
Wasn’t Usher thowin Usherbucks at dancers a few months ago?
Can you put your new channel in your channel tab? It'll make it easier to find for new subscribers
Yo who are those two small artists, they sound nice.
whats the background music you use? it sounds like zelda
Usher Raymond the fifth🤨? Humble him King D’Angelo!
WHY DOES THAT WILLOW SMITH SONG 𝔹𝕆ℙ   also wow that clip of FKA Twigs
What Shamir song was that, that you showed?
Not Twitter trying to cancel T-Pain???? Tf? So glad I’ve been avoiding bird app lately caz nooo
It has been over 15 years ever since he used autotune for his music and yall got a problem with it?
d'angelo doesn't make music!? i thought he was the no. 1 and only vocal star in the entire world?? guess he just manifests greatness.
Does anyone know the background music D’Angelo is using? It sounds like something from Kingdom Hearts but I’m not sure? It’s really nice!
Is this even considered canceling? This feels like a bunch of random twitter users giving different opinions
and honestly like have you heard t-pain with no auto-tune compared to usher with no auto-tune? like t-pain has such an angelic voice, and usher it’s just kinda like, there.
I think I’m missing an idea here. Why is it so crucial singers don’t use autotune? I, (personally as someone who plays instruments for fun), get irritated when there are covers with inaccurate pitches and incorrect beats. Not that the song is lovely, but it irks me too much to listen to.
Are you gonna make a video about the creepshow art drama? For those who didn’t know she stalked and harassed Emily art show.
all artists use autotune 😭 and before they used pitch-correction 💀 what
What on earth do people think happens in a music studio 😂
Has Usher even been relevant recently? I haven't heard from him in a while
HOLY CRAP WHERE AM I?
What do these people be smoking cuz they be high as heck if they think T-Pain caused people to use auto tune. That was their decision don’t say that he caused it.
What kind of person gets a flight attendant to bring their friend (??) in to some kind of meeting so they can shit on them??
What year is it? Are we still really shitting on t-pain for making bops with autotune? That man is talented and makes good music, end of discussion.
the whole music industry should get cancelled for using autotune then. heck even i use it, why is it such a bad thing? autotune can’t correct really really bad singing. in an age where technology can further help artists express themselves, is autotune really that bad??
how...like how? it’s music? it’s just auto tune? like how is it worth a cancellation?
He and a lot of other rappers have been singing with auto-tune for years and now people are mad about it?...people will find anything to complain about
Is that a Bee Angelo hoodie?! Either way, it's pretty cute✌
Why they doing T-Pain wrong like that
aw hell naw so they cancelled tpain for being tpain?!? what’s next? the migos get cancelled for their momma adlib cuz not everyone has a mom!! 🙄
Can we cancel Eminem for swearing now? Or Jimmy Barnes for pandering to people who live in rural areas?
I'm sorry WHAT?! I thought we understood that the autotune is noticeable its a specific sound you can't get naturally like in Imogen heaps hide and seek. Its not ruining music its enhancing it and adding something new to the music. Its not like he can't sing.
New camera? Lighting? Something is different? Looks good!
Do people not know he sings with AutoTune as an artistic choice? Jeez these people are clueless
Y'all?? WHO'S Y'ALL? T-Pain is music legend who's made the genre even better
autotune is literally a stylistic choice idk why ppl so mad
Wait huh? There’s no need to cancel T-Pain
bestiee,pinch me I'm dreaming   A SATURDAY POST?😭🎉
Wait what When did this happen????
