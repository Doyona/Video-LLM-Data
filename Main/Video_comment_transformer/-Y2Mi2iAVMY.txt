What animation software do you use?
Am I the only one thinking about how the witch knew TSC and others even though they have not met before or why was she after them.
why has the almighty pig shown up twice now
Nah bro got the “How did we get here” badge before I could💀
So that’s how pistons work? That’s messed up

Who would win?   A witch who has been honing her craft for presumably years, and was single handedly able to 1v5 the maint cast and win  OR  One oinky boy (on drugs)
11:12 bro got the”how did we get here?” Achievement 💀 If you live under a rock, and don’t know what it is, it’s when you get all effects on your character at once.
Wait Is this just Journey to the West
I noticed this in the background.. TECHNO POWER?
So weren’t they on kinda bad terms with purple after they left his village? I mean they did kinda ruin his life
Did purple even meet TSC, When they saw purple, They hugged TSC and Green, but I swear that purple never met TSC, and only blue and green. I’ve only watched animation vs Minecraft shorts so far, so there might be some lore I missed.
The pig had darkness how did he see?!
What is with Op pigs??? Idc i like it.
Never knew a sugarcane could do such op moves also why are the pigs so strong in this show?
Where is the subtitle for the speech?
now that i think of it,are all mobs humans?used to be?did the witch turn all of humanity into mobs?
Um why is pig not invisible because he has the invisible effect 🤓

Bro how does the pig got instan healthy for 3 minutes💀
Did you realized that at 10:04 green saved blue and then turned into a piston? So nice!🥲
Why didn’t alien backer’s comment get low likes?😅
11:13 Y'all wanna talk about the new Gotta Go Fast and Techno Power potions? I heard Mojang is trying out some more "unique" potion effects!
What is this, three times now we see a super pig?
did anyone else realize that the Witch disguise as SC even though she didnt know him? seems a too fishy for minecraft mob to have such knowledge of stickmen, let alone specific ones, almost like someone told, or showed her, who to watch out for...
Did anyone else notice one of the potion effects was “techno power”?
serious punch?
Can someone tell me who is the pig?
Who else saw the "techno power" effect on the pig?
Who else noticed the pig had a techno power effect?
Am I the only one who wants to know why Orange had a hotbar/inventory row of different colors of wool for no apparent reason?
11:15 anyone noticed techno power?
11:15 Techno power effect?!
How did this foreshadow camels
Is it just me, or do the animals always make the best characters? Like, the pig is becoming a recurring character and I love it, the parrots were really funny in the texture pack episode, and the chicken was amazing in the note block episode. I love this whole show so much.
Is the witch a woman or a man I'm confused
11:15 invisibility ???
Can somebody explain for me why purple is there?i remember in one episode they was put into jail by villager (bad English)
how did the witch know hmmmmmm
Who would win? The avengers or a drugged up pig?
Why the heck would they listen to purple instead of taking them somewhere where they know its safe?!
i noticed that one of the potions that the pig had was invisibility, so why wasnt the pig invisible?
4:34 how’s he not burning alive?
Anyone else noticed that one of the pigs effects what techno power?
Ik this vid is old but if i had to ask a stupid question:  What was the witch's intentions
why tf is that pig stronger than the dark lord
11:38  Am I the only one who got this one?

Time 11:11=12:00 What's that Technoblade as a child?

9:53 where is pig?😂
How am I still the only one noticing that there are two oranges?
A sugar cane that can fight, a pig that can do anything, what else?
did anyone else notice the gotta go fast and techno power affect?
How the hell does Alan make such an engaging and understandable fight scene where one of the combatants is a sentient crop of sugarcane??
is it real in computer?
I wonder if the pig was a foreshadowing of herobrine because it was the pig who fought the stickman and died then come back to fight a common enemy and is good which tells of red/herobrine fighting the stickman and died then fighting against a common enemy and is good.
I thought we didn’t like purple? Why are they acting buddy buddy?  Edit: I went back to make sure I wasn’t crazy and yeah, they definitely put purple in jail for destroying the city and letting blue and green almost die
Is this a OPM reference?
12:05 Purple picking flowers for his mum?
0:27 The fake Blue has muffled sound effect! Is it because this one's fake so it had a difference between the group??
At 11:14 i saw techno power... did yall saw techno power and R.I.P TECHNOBLADE
Anyone at 4:45 notice how the witch was carrying 2 swords? Then only uses one at the fight at the hut? Everyone should know green’s fighting style where he sometimes uses 2 swords in fights instead of one so i think the witch used green’s fighting style against them
i find it kinda… idk, ironic? that blue was the first one kidnapped by the witch like, blue is the one who discovered potions, and was kidnapped by a mob that uses potions
Hi, Alan! I just want to say: your animations are so cool! Thanks a bunch for entertaining us with your videos, they're cool, and also funny, and also, what do you call the thing the Pig did in 11:25-11:27? You know, him fighting the witch after drinking all the potions?
Wait, I just realised, the texture for the obsidian on the portal is the old one despite everything else using the new texture
What effect of. Techno potion
Does anyone notice the glowing effect At 11:14

hey Alan, how do you react that one genuis use this your video for ad? He just steal moment in 10:01 and this ad be on youtube
Anyone else think it would've been great to see blue using potion combat in later episodes? Playing to his strengths between archery and brewing would've made for some interesting fights.
why is this game not on steam ?
10:54 anyone realised blue has a creative stuff? He doesnt have heart or hunger system.
9:54 where is pig?
Isn’t this just the story of an emperor’s new groove?

Is it weird that I would want to be a sugar cane after watching this video??
Me imagining me:is it techno blade story?
Hey, did any of you notice that when the pig drank all the potions, one of the effects was named (Gotta Go Fast) with a sonic ring next to it?
Why doesn't anyone talk about how cute Purple is picking flowers on 12:03? 😭😭😭😭
Is it just me or did the only thing people notice when the pig drinks the potions is “techno power”?
That fish be flopping.. How the hell did he become friends with a plant, a lama (correct me if I’m wrong), and floppy fish

Damn for the pig there were 3 Easter egg potions. Conduit power? Techno power? Gotta go fast? Also how it's visible with invisibility potion? How levitation potion in fighting? Dolphins grace?

Dear Alan Becker, How do you feel about ads that contain your videos?
What  is   Wrong With   Him
What  Happened To  Them
9:40It is anime?
Hey ! Did you sold theses animations to a game creator for the ads ? I've seen ads of a game using parts of this video, the game's name is "Stickman vs craftsman" i just wanted to tell you, in case they stole you
why does it feel like the pig is the main character
did you guys look the potion effects when the pig drink? Take a closer look XD
Does anyone else get the MHA reference ? , That last pig punch is like the All Might one's VS the brainless
Why won’t the pig levitate when there’s levitation effect?

Why can witches be that exciting in vanilla minecraft?
Man is that pig is 🐷 or 🐶 it is working smarter like a 🐶

Can you ad music like the ones from the adds using the witch vs stickmen?
11:14 wtf is Techno power and Gotta Go Fast LMAO
9:59 yo wait why did I see this as a game ad-
People are using your videos for adds, did you know about this? Just checking to make sure you knew-
Man wtf someone is using this video on their ad (Craft stick man fighting ) i saw the ad on youtube today on someones video
Alan, an ad for a stickman game called “Block Miner Craft World” is using your animations for their ads, did you give permission. This animation of the witch was in an ad,,  specifically the part where the which turned the stickman into dye.
what kind of potion affect is techno power? harnesing technoblades power? Gotta go fast? sonic refference? cool
is this the soul soul fruit???
What is the name of that game
If the witch had a potion like that in the chest, why didnt he use it? hes able to create potions of all kinds. he should be pretty smart to use that potion.
why is there so much super saiyan pigs
My friends: who's your favorite cartoon character?  Me, who knows it's the pig from your series: uuuuhhhhh that's complicated...
There are a bunch of mobile apps taking your animations and using them for advertisement without credit. I keep coming across them when watching YouTube on my phone. Are you going to try to take them down? The games are just shameless cash-grabs littered with ads, so it's obvious that they're not fan games or anything.
Hey Alan some game named stickman vs craftsman is using the footage from this video I don't think they have the copyright license
what anime is this??!?!?!?!?SHESSSHHHH
I no one gonna talk about how talented green is as a sugar cane? He can play noteblocks and fight really good.
jesus christ dude the fight scene with the pig and the witch wasnt a fight it was a murder
Wait is the Pig actually Techno blade  When drinking Potions
Why's the witch throwing potions of healing, jump boost, and luck (etc.) at Second Coming? (Also, a purple potion isn't an invisibility potion.)
Is that you tecno blade
Turning people into items is cool and all but how did the witch get a hero of the village potion, the other weird effect are just easter eggs
9:49 bruh that’s the ninja kiwi thing on BTD6 right?
the battles are incredebils
green+blue+yellow+red= google group! orange+purple= halloween group?
11:14 Achivement Unlocked! How did we get here?
Wow that pig... but can he beat goku?
Didn't the purple one betray our group last? Why they're friends?
Piggy vs shaggy who would win?

Does anyone notice that orange throws his and then randomly gets it back after green shows him self
*me asking myself why i find a sugar cane fighting a witch so addictive*
New mong us vs animation

Anyone seen an ad using the fight scene for their ad?
IS THIS PIG TECHNOBLADE?
Alan Becker can u make me as a stickman?
Why is the pig so strong
Blue is hallucinating from not eating his drug in so long.
Am I the only one who noticed that the sick figures are colors of the rainbow??

How do you manage to do this it’s so cool😱🤩🤯🙀
i got a question. can stick figures go to anyone's computer? if it not work. i will like your video.
What is your favourite anime?  Me:

HOLD UP! Is that sonic ability at 11:15 ?! Wait... *sees the name* ahahahahhaHAHAHAHHAHAHA!!! 😆
Idk how did yellow red green and blue get far away
I saw an add for a game that litteraly stole this guy's video (the fight part) like why
what the f!   Is the  whole  series over?
Me: Why is the portal working it doesn't have the bottom blocks??????????? Stickman: get your mind on the action
I have one question. Is this pig stronger than Goku?
11:16 are we just gonna sit here and not going to talk about techno power???
11:14 *How did we get here?* Aquire every effect in the game.
Please make witch vs animation vs Minecraft part two
idk but the fish was awesome when it used the sword.
is it just me, or did I see the effect 'techno power' at 11:15
I have some serious questions about green’s physics as sugarcane…he was getting active chopped up and growing himself on the spot…and somehow survived all of it
When will u make a new videos
11:10 is this a reference to the AVM short called "potions"?
Why are there two slow falling effects on the pig?

What? (Что?)
Is there someone can make this witch house if you can pls make a video tutorial how to build because I want to build in minecraft that will be so cool if you will make a video tell me pls :)
Wait a second, why are they being all friendly with Purple? The last time they saw him, he nearly let them all plummet to their deaths for an Enderdragon Egg and he got his whole kingdom ravaged. Figured he'd be in jail or exiled or something after that, or at least that the rest of the gang would hold a grudge like SC did.
was there a easter egg called techno power when the pig consumed the potion
I'm not sure mostly because ei know nothing about fighting but I feel like the witch blue has a different fighting style?
9:43 anyone notice how they go in rainbow order? red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple
Anyone notice the potion effect ‘Techno Power’  Edit: I just noticed one called ‘Gotta Go Fast’
Um alan why do a pig have a effect name “gotta go fast”
That pig was going haywire when he was debating the witch
have you guys ever noticed that red is always the first one to have something bad happen to them?
Did my eyes deceive me or did I just see Techno Power in the effects
Is it just me or did I see a potion effect that says techno power? Like literally there’s a pig icon with that says techno power
11:15 thecno power?
What in the absolute hell
You see that?that is not a pig just no
Could that pig be technoblade using 10% of his power?
Is the pig Technoblade?
Did blue get the nether wart?
Anyone else see techno power as a potion for the pig?!
Are we just not gonna talk about how green as sugar cane went ham during that fight?
musical grass  what
Who is purple?
13:44 are we dancing?
Is it me or an ad popped up with the fight scene at like 9:39 ish
11:15 Hero of the village doesn’t have to do anything with this episode and why it has invisibility and it’s visible?
Why do you add the lucky position of the game that was not see in the game in MC 🤭
Bro do I see techno power in one of the potion effects at 11:15 😆
Small detail but do y’all notice that after the witch disguised as Blue throws the first potion at the Orange and Orange deflects it, there’s an “oh, crap” expression on Blue, like the witch wasn’t expecting Orange to be so skilled
Who would win? Goku or both the second coming at the end of animations vs animator and the pig with all the potions?
Excuse me... What.
technoblade is that u?
idk what is the best part of this, Witch vs sugarcane or ULTRAPIG vs witch
I like when the lama builds really fast like he's rad man who is faster than yellow???

Quick question, will we ever see what’s in the 5 nether portals from last time? Also, what happened with the spider king and the wither? Will our heroes return to the dolphin kingdom? I think the drowned pirates might be a problem for the dolphins and our heroes may come back to rescue them.

Wait a minute, when the pig turned the witch into a dye, it was purple dye....and the dyes seem to be the same colour as the stickmen (tsc turned into orange dye, blue turned to blue dye and so on), so purple stickman could be related to the witch... Counter argument: It could just resemble the purple clothes the witch is wearing, and purple got his redemption arc in animation vs LoL(?), and might actually be a good guy now.
What mod is this? Looks cool!

y que paso que ahora solo usan espadas? se olvidaron que saben meter puñetasos a diestra y siniestra And what happened that now they only use swords? They forgot that they know how to punch left and right
Questions for you Alan: Does The Second Coming remember his powers? Or was that story separate from the others? Will his powers make a small appearance in any of the other animations?  If Alan has answered these questions before, can someone fill me in? I'm not 100% in tune with everything that goes on. I'm pretty much here for the animations. Anyway, great job Alan and Allies! Keep up the absolutely amazing work.

Could this be canon that the pig is actually a reincarnation of the pig from Ep 4 because the pig knows too well how to use all the potions to his advantage. And also, it had the same trigger effect with the potion affects going down a list. But that's just a theory. A GAM-

wow, this video is amazing  what happend in the next part ? who knows
Hmmm is the pig technoblade?
wait a second all the stickmans goes into the portal... but... the pig doesnt go in?!!!
11:15 did anyone notice techno power lol
Since the witch was so hard to kill, could it have been purple who was the witch? The dye was purple and since when the stickmen were turned into the dye of their corresponding colours, and the witch’s was purple, i know they got punched away by the pig but since purple on their own desktop had managed to get to the end, they couldve possibly ender pearled back. Im also taking into consideration that they didnt have hands, but the stickmen were able to drink the potions to get back to normal so they have some form of grasp in those forms, but its only a possibility
What in the living top 10 anime battles did i just witness

Alan, if you are out of idea then how about make the stick figure met any youtuber like dream or pewdiepie or anyone... You dont have to do it if you dont want to.

Minecraft: How many rules did you break? Alen Becker: Yes
