How do the migos get praised for what they do it’s this new generation who unappreciative
Why do takeoff always have the last verse???
This is the jazz sample from the movie the nice guys, and I’m sure they got it from an actual song from the 70s. But I was watching it again just now and as it opened up I was like “avalanche??”
