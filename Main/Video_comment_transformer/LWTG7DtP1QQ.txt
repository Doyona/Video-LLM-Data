Why is she so hyper? She makes me nervous.
I feel like the wine bottle is more for decor if you want it to be??
What do you think the person who made the Miranda glass thing was thinking when they received the picture 😂
I wonder if the “projector” is for the 3D blocks? No idea.
Everyone explaining to her how to use the 3D light box thing, but I'm here looking for an answer for what you do with those roses?
It's really off topic but can you ask Eric if he can do a Patrick  impression if not it fine I thought it would be funny. Frome hatters back off please
Why do PAJAMAS need pockets?! WTF are you carrying while you sleep? The soap is great if you’re somewhere with no soap like camping…how have you never seen the apple cider vinegar gummies?!
Why would u need pockets on ur pjs if you’re going to sleep?
How do you spell your baby's name the girl baby how do you spell her name
How do you not know what Capri Blue Volcano scent is?!?!? It was notorious at Anthropologie back in 2011 and beyond!
Okay, so, Coleen … you do know that the word charcuterie refers to a presentation of meats, right? You kept using the words cheeseboard and charcuterie as though they are interchangeable. They aren’t. And when you described what you would put on the board, you never mentioned any types of meat (that I noticed, anyway), so I’m kinda thinking you got your terms confused there. I totally agree that there isn’t very much real estate for a variety of meats (or cheeses). It could be perfect for a good sized snack tray for two people, but not big enough for a party.
i feel like the wine bottle in question could be used for a mixed drink you made at home
I didn’t understand if you meant it as a joke that it’s sexist that skirts and some pants don’t have pockets or if you are serious. If you are serious please explain why you think that
So don’t judge but I haven’t watched her in a awhile… Can anyone let me know if those babies are twins?
are they fraternal or identical twins???
Are you also Maranda sing’s ?? Cuz u sound Like her
Did you not buy the lights to go under the 3d crystal engraved pieces lol. It looks even better with the lights! I loveeee mine!
correct me if I’m wrong but at 10:45 that’s definitely the same music they play in Hey Bear videos right? 😆😆
Colleen "like doesn't every bathroom have soap?" the girls bathroom in my old high school : nope.😒
I usually am all for pockets in pants, but what do you put in your pockets while you're sleeping? LOL

IS ERIK IN THE VAMPIRE DIARIES?????
What site is cooking pot on
Why should pjs have pockets? 😂
I would say the big wine bottle tervis thing is for like beaches that don’t allow alcohol and you can put the whole bottle in that to be secretive. Or like you said the cork doesn’t go back in and the tervis has a lid. Or just to be low key about having wine.
Some wines are better if they were put in a decanter before drinking (when beeing poured the wine mixes with air and that some how is good I guess). Im no expert. Or maybe its for wines like rosé that need to be cold 🤔
Out of curiosity is mothers day a different date in America then the UK as I swear it March after my mum's birthday I'm so confused with it lol can someone tell me if possible xxxxxxx
I’m a wine dinosaur and I believe that the metal casks are for keeping chilled wine chilled on an adventure? I’m in SB and we like to bring a bottle to the mission to drink in the rose garden, you know you know, and if you want a chilled white on a summer evening, a cask would keep it cool on the walk from my apt. I think.
Why the actual frik, why hasn’t Miranda made a single video in a month?? I NEED those Miranda Mondays!!!
Who else wants to know where season two of haters back off is
With the wine question sometimes if it is fancy wine letting it 'breathe' makes it taste nicer. Its a whole thing.
Wonder what the 3D factory thought of Miranda🤣🤣
Mother’s Day? It was Mother’s Day months ago for me
Colleen nobody's pajama pants have pockets... Why do you need pockets when you're going to bed?
for the roses they’ll be cute on a coffee table or nightstand maybe?
What website did you get those 3d blocks from?
Okay but why do pajamas need pockets??
Did anybody else notice that she is wearing the same shirt she did whenever she did this with Flynn
i know this isn't your vlog channel but tortilla talk question!!! when are you reacting to when terry predicted about the twins???
Whats the link to the 3d photo block?
ok but is the little “projector thing” not the light for the 3D photo cubes??? i thought that was gonna be all the comments but no ones said it they just keep recommending you buy one🥲🤣
For the wine tumblers, maybe it’s to keep it cold.😂🫣😅
Why would someone need pyjama bottoms with pockets? 🤔
Maybe the bottle is white wine and it is to keep it cold.
I love Colleen but why does she continue to support amazon and give them so much business 😩
That looks like a bulb for the projector of an interactive whiteboard. I ordered one recently from amazon and it got lost. I wonder did you get mine 🤔
can anyone link the 3d thing? 😄
Does anyone else have a hard time telling the twins apart, or is that a me problem?
But like what do you need pockets in bed for
Does anyone realize how she's wearing the same top she wore when she was testing baby products for Flynn????!!!!!
On the cheeseboard debate: 🧀 With the cheeseboard open, I'd place the dishes in the cavity where it swings open. Keeps the top half open, and give more room for meats and cheese! Also could use a piece of fabric over the utensil area and fill it that way. You're allowed to feel a little bougie! 🤭
no one else could get the babies while you were filming a video?
Is the projector thing for your projecter for your shows?   Cuz I thought you said u had projector malfunctions
Omg when is Colleen's babys gona have brown eyezzzzz
Wine bottle prob for being discreet/travel/ not having glass in certain places (pools/beach)
My story ? I don't tell  he ?  He and woman get wedding enegment ring!    Milo Ventimiglia  and myself story?
Wine thing: can save for later bc no cork, also, can drink in public ? 🤷🏼‍♀️ idk
How did you order without knowing what they are? How is that even possible. And no not all bathrooms have soap. That's the whole point
Is it me or does she seem picky 🤔
I think the soap thing is to carry around just in case a public bathroom doesn’t have soap.
Where’s the 3d glass thing from??
Colleen has forgotten that glass wine bottles break?? A broken wine bottle _will_ ruin your picnic, while out hiking. 💕
why would you need pockets when you go to sleep haha you do you girl
The wine bottles are prob used in place of a glass bottle plus those are designed to keep it cold, honestly you could put anything in them I suppose even hot things like coffee??
Can you please post more Miranda sings videos
Maisy: mom why is there an arm going up and down in my face
I’m only 15 but I think the wine bottle thing is for making your own  Like once u make it u keep it in the bottle
Love your shirt! I do wonder how you got that projector thing.
I put my coffee in those little cups and people always ask me why I have my coffee in a wine Tumblr
did anybody notice that when she got the photos she didn't get one of flyn
Aren't those bottles supposed to keep things cold? I would think it's for white wine to keep it chilled if bringing it to a party, the beach, etc!
Or what about the wine that comes in wine boxes maybe so you don’t carry the whole box you can just pour some there and take it where your going idk lol that’s my guess on the🍷 😂
Can you link the 3d thing? That is so cool I want to get my stepmom that!
Am I the only one who thinks the "wine bottle" doesn't have to be used for wine? Lol I'd put some ice cold water, juice, etc in there for a beach day/picnic
What pajamas have pockets lol
What is the name of the item you had made of the babies?
Um but could we buy the Miranda and Daisy 3d portraits for ourselves tho 😬
Thanks so much I loved the video I have a tortilla talk question: which one of the twins look more like you? In your opinion of course
What is a woman?
Try wigs some time?!  🤣
Don't you have one of you and Rachel
Say you go to the beach and you want to take wine what are the chances or a metal wine bottle breaking plus maybe it regulates tempature of the wine
I would think that the "galaxy"wine bottle would keep the wine cold longer than it would be if kept in glass bottle
My guess is the wine set is for the pool or somewhere that glass in a no no.
I've seen people use those little wine "glasses" for camping, and I'd assume the bottle is so you can take the rest with you on a camping trip and not worry about it being glass?
Wait it’s not Mother’s Day yet! SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN IM SO CONFUSED
Maybe the bottle is for boxed wine?...
I’m not a wine drinker myself, but I think it would work for people that like boxed wine for like a picnic?? Otherwise it just seems pointless
The wine bottle probably just keeps the wine cool?
The wine contraption seems insulated and so is for travel! Taking your drinks to functions/the park or beach maybe?
Ok, I don’t drink wine but maybe the wine bottle is for pool days? I know some pools don’t allow glass bottles for safety reasons. So maybe people want to drink wine at the pool so they pour it into a non-breakable bottle? I don’t know…
Colleen, I feel you on the pajama pants and the no pockets, but GIRL, What are you needing pockets for when you're sleeping??? Lol just thought that was a little funny
Dude why r u so negative about all the products 😂 i swear alot of then were really cute! Even the pjs! I feel like you are not fairly rating these products cause ur in a rush
