Who are we🍴🎉🧑🏻‍🍳 ?Left or right, we always blink, We speak in flashes — quick, not pink! We warn your moves with shiny flair, But most forget we’re even there… 😤
Who's here after dainsleif natlan archon quest?
0:20 OMG is that me or does Furina have Damoclece's Sword on her undersole? 💀
1:46 Where is this location? I don't remember visiting it
Where's Wriothesley?
1:05 did he just wink while winking
WHO'S HERE AFTER 6.0 SNEZHNAYA TRAILER
Oh wait why is lyney kinda hot
Who is here after the 5.0 Natlan trailer?
Who’s here after the 5.0 TRAILER
man how did we reach the end of fontaine already
Who came here after the natlan Livestream?
Who’s watching before 5.0 trailer???
WHO'S HERE AFTER SNEZHNAYA 6.0 Trailer??
Someone rewatching it again before the natlan releases?
I just freaking noticed it....0:33 why is Dottore doing there??????????
I keep rewatching this thing when it came out idk why
what kind of music is playing at 4:06?
2:52 wait why haven't we seen this part yet
Wait this is already 8 months ago?!
4:35 guess what happen to childe 2 sec after this
who is here after act 5? what a journey
anyone knows the bgm when childe is activating foul legacy?
Am i the only one that feels a little nostalgic seeing this? It happened only 3 months ago,but act 1 and act 2 feel so..... Distant,to me.
Guys, who know the music?
Is Tartaglia part of the problem of Fontaine?
Song? Music? Please!
4:20 wait is that childe?
4:30 idk why but that melody sounds familiar if anyone knows something please let me know.
Bro, why are you talking about global warming bro?
4:05 Does anyone know the name of this ost?
Huh, such a interesting Arc, i wonder how it will end?
Childe Transformation Gacha when?
Is it just me, or did Vacher’s story resembled that of Booker DeWitt’s?
I wonder if we see signora in fotnaine
I wonder what 4.1 archon quest will be
Rather low to not only copy the aesthetic of Bioshock, but the ending too? pls be better
Genshin is Focalor gonna have a Banner?
wait where is that cottage located
What does it cost to put a simple button to skip the game's dialogues? we can no longer stand endlessly pressing the mouse click or keyboard space.
Looking interesting 🤔 should I play it!?
Whenever I hear “is this part of the show?” All I can hear is Minnie Mouse’s voice.
So does Childe save/intervene in our trial? I'm getting Liyue flashbacks lol
When is this version supposed to be here?
Why is fontaine a lot more advanced than mond or any other region in that regards
Who know theme music on 2.18?
umm helo , how the story will progress , it's mess now lol and i'm hella confused wth
Just asking but... the pipe is a SWORD ?!!!
Is Focalors VA Constance from Fire Emblem? She sounds pretty similar
Where TF is Wriothesley?
why is childe here😨
TAYLOR SWIFT??
What is the music startimg at 4:05
Childe joining the good side now?!??
when will there be a banner on Itto?
Mafia, Svarog from Honkai: Star Rail & a Waterfall that can be seen in Lake Gala in Trails of Cold Steel 4?
who made the captions???
Y’all help, what happened to 3.9???
I love everyone's voices, I gotta hear their Chinese voices now. All the voices are exactly how I imagined them in my mind. The siblings playstyle looks fun too. I'm definitely gonna aim for all three of them! Is Furina the real issue here like with Shogun? And Tartaglia being that way makes sense since hes a Hydro, Hydro traits are justice and equality. Nice to see he's gonna be in Fontaine now I wonder if Wanderer will be as well since for every region so far, an Anemo boy has helped us out when we needed it.
Who else thinks Childe is a distraction again?
childeeee but where your vision go
Where is it arlecchino?
If I had ideas how to improve this game can i somewhere posted that or it´s just a closed concept?
can someone tell me the name of the ost that plays between around 3.00 and 4.00
Date of release?
FONTAINE is the MATRIX?!?!?
What’s up with Focalors right eye in 4:02?
What if the focalors in the chair is a fake and the true one is trapped in the Oratrice by Arlecchino, while one of her orphan puppet helpers acts as focalors
anyone else genuinely baffled at how so many people think lynette dies there in the tank?
Wait tf is Childe doing over there
Why does Focalors sound like Fishcl💀
Is anyone getting Fischl vibes from Focalors VA? Or is it just me?
Can’t lie watching all the X.0 trailers back to back Fontaine feels like it’s lacking something, may just be that the sumeru music went too hard tho
I wonder what the glowing cubes are. are they in 4.0? or is it like sumeru desert where they come at a later patch but are visible from mainland.
Uh.... Is Childe's vision not in its usual place?
Who else's in the "no storage space" gang?
wtf is dat altisia city from ff15?
"The Doctor" is the harbinger in Fontaine right?
But has the story telling improved ?!?
TAYLOR SWIFT???
Are we finally going to get a hydro claymore character at fountain?
is that TAYLOR SWIFT????? 3:27
Why does Focalor’s VA remind me of Fischl 🥲
STOP I HAVENT FINISHED THE SEMRU ARCHON QUEST
Why does Lyney remind me of diluc in a way
Do you think it's right
To treat a trial like it's an opera?
The line between a trial and a performance can be a little blurred...
I wonder how long before the rest of the world
Becomes part of this underwater museum, too?
Wait, who am I...?
We want to know why it has a consciousness?
Why can it deliver sentences accurately?
Is this... part of the show?
What happened!?
And as such, a trial is in order
3:55 - 4:00 WHO is that on the floor? there's some kind of red aura/energy coming out of him . perhaps its similar to the aura coming from red crystal which we purified in Monstadt?
where's the short emo anemo boy😢
Who is the narrator?
why tartaglia there?
I really want to get Lyney but I don't understand why they made him a bow user and not a catalyst when he's literally a magician.
where Arlecchino?
what is childe doing in fontaine
Interesting… Why Tartaglia was in there?
Fosalor?  anyway can't wait for Lady Maria's full kit, I hope she'll be playable in the current meta
Wherss childe vision?
Eww why is ed sheeran there😭😭😭
Do you guys think we might meet Kavehs mother somewhere in Fontaine?
So is this the part where we completely disregard who Childe works for and what he’s done? Is he the hero now?
So is this a Raiden like situation? Where the Archon is the enemy of the people?
0:50 is that a spoiler board for future quests? Am I seeing an golden sword there?
Can anyone else explain why the traveler does the hand thing at 3:55 ? He did the same thing in the sumeru quest when they met Dottore and it’s slowly starting to annoy me
when does this update relase?
Everyones talking about childe but  WHAT HAPPENED TO LYNETTE?! IS SHE OKAY 😭
oh is that a physical build archer i wonder 🤔🤔🤔  was kinda looking for long range physical with similar c0 eula damage
where's albedo?
CAN SOMEONE HELP ME I keep seeing the party joining animations everywhere but I play on mobile and don’t have them
WHO IS THIS AT 2:52????!  PLEASE HELP!
do we know who's talking at 4:10? 😭
When will This come out????
3:43 Did travel actually talk???
I laughed so hard when i saw Childe omfg why is this man everywhere
Uuuh, hoyo, why doesn't tartaglia have his vision?
Why does the cryo character use the claymore again? Can't we get a decent ice mage for *once* ? We have 4 that use the sword, 3 that use the polearm, 2 that use the bow, 2 that use the claymore, not *ONE* ice mage. How about some more *Geo* characters? Dendro is the newest and already has more characters than Geo.
0:33 is that dottore on the flying ship thingy?
Where is the way to celistia??? 😢
is Genshin Impact made in UE or Unity?
Childe again????
3:56 WHY IS AETHER SAD???? WHY????????? Paimon trying to comfort him is so wholesome but I need some answers.
Hmm, I would play the Phantom of the Opera theme in my head upon entering Fontaine.
My only question is WHAT IS CHILDE DOING IN FONTAINE
who is that electro sword user ,she looks like kafta and some kujo sara looks @4:04  if anyone knows comment plz
Nahh how much GB does Fontaine take?
Bro what Tart be doing in there 💀
Wtf, freminet is a "he"?!
When will 4.0 be released ?
wait, where is Arlechino?😮
Is it just me or the Hydro Archon looks a lot like Qiqi?
Why is Genshin soooo good at making these trailers?
Childe delusion playable when?
Where is Genshin Impact in Switch??!!!
This might be amazing but is the 40 GB worth it?
Man how big the update for mobile and pc
Will the hutao come out again in 2023?
Does... does lynett drown? I mean i know its kinda dark but her body is kinda lifeless in one scene and after that they say charges were pressed i mean... this is a hoyoverse game... just seems too soon
Man fornaine looks dope. I wonder what .1 .2 will be like
How many hydroculus we’ll have to collect that time ? 😅
Is her name Focalors, or Forçalors
IS KAGGY BACK?!?!? Honestly he could just voice 2 characters
Are finally going to get electro childe?
Childe to the rescue again?
Why does focalors lowkey sound like fischl? 😭
wtf, why is the ginger here?
Is this Nathan because of how fire the trailer
What about 3.9?
3:50 is that a cane? or something else?
why do they always leave out lumine-
why do they always leave out lumine-
So Lynette disappears in the water and Lyney gets pinned for murder?
I love the music at 1:55 . Can anyone tell the name? Has hoyoverse released it
Was bell sword in his/her hand?  Is the meta swipe?
Anyone wanna explain why the female robots in fontaine are THICC AF!, might as well call me william afton cuz im bouta put kids in them robots.
Why isnt anyone talking about how some of the charecters visions are not there like in 1:00 lynneys vision on his bow thats on his back is not there and for lynnete in 3:15 her vision js nkt there on her bow thats on her hair even childes vision is missing in the scene where he shows up
Wheres chlorinde? I want her😢
Hello, how much will the update weigh?
3:55 whos that lady with lightning sword? I forgot her name
What if Neuvilette framed Lyney for drowning Lynette, and Lynette is with Neuvilette on the act? It makes sense as he says that ''the trial is in order''? I don't know I'm just speculating
No new geo character?
Is it me or Childe doesn't have his vision in the clip?
anyone else here who hasnt finished all archon quests and already afraid of the spoiler hell that will come online?
Is it that everybody is ignoring that Lynette's lower body is gone?
Did anyone else notice Childe’s Hydro vision is gone?
Is it possible to drown paimon underwater?
Okay- am i tripping? I swear I saw a moment in this video where Lyney says 'The Court and Opera are the same, they both want you to believe them, their lies' or something along these lines- 😂
what was the opera being sung around 4:04 ? it sounds so familiar
whats with all the child like archons bruh
What is the ost called
Are we actually gonna be able to swim?? (I’m still in inazuma story quest 😭😭)
Ohh comeone man I just lost my account and now they upload this trailer what the hell man
2:52 previous hydro archon maybe?
I don’t know how to say this but the animations/cutscenes look like they would taste good.      ALSO WHAT IS THE GINGER DOING IN FONTAINE?????
Wait they put Orianna in Genshin Impact?
CHILDE REDEMPTION ARC?! 🤯🤯
"Faux-shaa-lore"? Is that the correct reading? I thought it was supposed to be pronount "Faux-KAA-lore." Anyway, OOOOOH!! AN AIRSHIP!! Please please PLEASE tell me we get to own one!
At 0:50 can you see childe flying by as one of the flashes?
Childe isn't wearing his vision . . . this isn't a mistake is it? 🫢
am i the only who have the urge to punch the Hydro Archon so hard that she flying like a roman from Asterix ?  and i'm so confused to see so much people hyped, personally i'm so disapointed
Will 4.0 bring controller support to android version?
I wonder if Childe is going to help stop the Fontaine crisis
is it just me or does everyone in the english dub sound the same maybe its just me
Are we being accused of the attempted murder of Lynette? Genuine question. Also the designs and voices are amazing! I love the story so much! Can't wait for the 14th!!! Also is it just me who gets massive Belobog (Idk how to spell it, but that first world in HSR) vibes from Fontaine?
is the first voice of tighnari or lyney? i'm confused...
Anyone else think Fontaine looks suspiciously like Altissia from FFXV 😅
WHERE IS ARLECHINO
Who's that on 2:50?
3:41 is that Diona???
Is it really the time for my R5LV90 The Bell to shine???
It’s been three years… where’s the Nintendo switch release?
what's the prophesizes crisis? how does the Oratrice have a consciousness and issue sentences accurately? what's in the underwater museum? what are we getting arrested for? where tf is our sibling? I have so many questions, that's why I keep playing
0:34 is that dottore on the flying boat???? He kinda looks like him
I’m so confused, are we skipping 3.9 and going straight to 4.0??
Noo, where is Childe’s vision after he jumped and flipped 😭
whats wrong with subtitles alll sub came at frist hhahahah
I dont undertand about why the traveller doesnt seek the help of other archons whom he befriended like it would give him reputation and power
Can you name me the song from this ost, please???
Why does Childe have a vision what happened
Who is the one talking in the beginning?
who’s that hot silver haired man 😍
Fontaine looks so good! But more underground?? Sumeru have me bad ptsd
I wonder where is Arlecchino hmm
Every new region is more advanced...why we won't be able to swim underwater in Mond or Inazuma for example? I wish the regions were also kind of updated, because now, there's so much difference between Mond and Fontaine for example.
What is Childe doing there😂
Switch?
What is childe doing here 😭LOLL IT looks AWESOME THO
0:30 to 0:39 there's a floating bit of land in the air surrounded by what looks like the bridges from the loading screen, it doesn't look like Celestia, and these bridges are all over, but don't match the design of Fontaine's main city, I might be looking too far into this, but we might get to see way more about Celestia than we previously knew? You can also see the same bridges at the start of the trailer. There are a lot of these broken bridges throughout Fontaine. Am I looking too far into everything?
why does the event look like something inside mario games
So we not talking about the new oceanid? 💀
Why doesn’t Childe have a vision???😂😂😂
Anybody notice that the on the first throne at the beginning of the video, you can see a figure? And that it also disappears the next time we see the throne at 2:44?
Where’s Childe’s vision
I was sitting here happily enjoying the trailer when I saw the same little childe for liyue Literally WHERE DID CHILDE COME FROM? IS ALRECCINO NOT ENOUGH??!! also where was alreccino in this trailer??
Ayo tf is Childe doing there was he in china 💀💀
Maybe I'm blind, bus is this Dottore on the plane in 0:34?
can she use a def goblet pleassee???
was it just me or did the two robots dancing give of NieR:Automatica vibes?
There are some well done male characters. But Liney is who? There are a lot of anime where there are cool images of male characters (I mean appearance) So that it is a normal man, whom you look at and understand that he is dangerous, that he is capable of a lot, that he is normally dressed, and not like a girl with pubertal syndrome. Basically the problem with almost all male characters in genshin is that they look like sugary BOYS.
Is it planned to make really courageous male characters in genshin? Or will it be a half-boy, half-girl?
I'm not sure if it's part of the plot, but i genuinely think focalors has no "archon-ish" aura whatsoever
So Freminet's signature weapon is The Bell?
Do i see it right ? Is that a reference of the movie The prestige of Christopher Nolan ? it make sense now. It's almost the same plot haha
Where is Childe's Vision?
Wait why child is her i thought we have don with this guy
Bruh why tf they gotta make the Hydro archon a loli smh...she had a lot of potential ...i was hoping she would apply "wet " status on all of us but here we are😭😭
Is that Lynette scene is like same as Now You See Me (movie) magic show when she pretends like she failed the performance by trapped in that water cage but actually then appear somewhere? INTERESTING ASF
more tunnels? i get the underwater experience, but not tunnels pls. we still have Natlan, it's much more sensible that a volcanic nation has a lot of caves & tunnels.
Why did the codes expire so quick?
Did anyone notice that Childe didn’t have his vision at the end?
What i can say? Hmm. Genshin Impact is even more fantastic that it was. Hope it will live forever
Does that trailer hint Focalors has a literal split personality?
Where is Childe's Vision?!😮
sooo. how much space needed for genshin in this new update?
Ayo are we getting delusion childe???
why does it sound like a posh Senator Armstrong at 4:06 ?
Ohh.. is the one under water the true hydro archon?
2:12 RPM GET IN GEAR?!!?!?!  2:23 AND HES TRANSFORMED?! OH MY GOD
i wonder if childe was there to save us again, or if he was the cause of the chaos for the upcoming archon quest hmmm im so excited!!
omg! Is it just me or Freminet really look like Felix from Stray Kids? 😳
why does Childe’s eyes look more dead than ever?
I’m curious as to who did Lynette lose? She’s an anemo after all.. lol
I was watching at slow motion around 4.15 and if you watch carefully you'll see Clorinde is actually slicing the robots? So maybe she takes our side later on even tho it seems like we're going to go against her ?
Wtf is childe doing😂😂😂
Um did anyone notice how Childe's vision is missing, knowning mihoyo and hoyoverse this is never gonna be a editing error, Theories anyone?
the corrupt judges in the Fontaine? hmmn
did anyone else notice that childe doesn’t have his vision on him?
What if that "Oratrice" is the former Hydro Archon???🤔
Why no one is talking about childe,s entry 😭
Does that mean we getting childe electro skin in fontaine? O.O
The mention of rain and the urgency to uncover the secrets of the nation's Oratrice raises questions about the impending crisis and the importance of understanding the capabilities and consciousness of this entity.
the bell finally having a purpose???
CHILDE IN THE ARCHON QUEST AGAIN!! DEFENDING NOT ONLY HIS MR. WORLDWIDE TITLE, BUT ALSO MOST BANNERS TO DATE WITH A WHOPPING _FIFTH_ BANNER COMING UP SOON.
Why is Childe everywhere??
Focalor is fiscl sister?
My gosh why do I keep seeing Clorinde as Mikasa 🤣 i dunno if thats her burst but it looks like Mikasa dashing with her cable wire!!
What childe doing there?
Is nobody gonna talk about LYNETTE’S POOR LEGS 😨😨😨
IS FHAT CHILDE????
they addin balls in this upadte ?
I’m confused who gonna the villain💀 childe or arlecchino
Why does that tone sound like Mona
Is it just me, or does Childe showing up in Fontaine almost solidify the rumors of him dying? Cause I don't want Childe to die!!
i might install genshin again, wanted to know why childe is in fontaine
Yall realize childe's vision is nowhere to be seen?? Instead he uses delusion??? I HOPE HE'S OKAY OMG I CANT, MY MAN IS STEPPING A LITTLE MORE CLOSER TO DEATH BY USING TOO MUCH DELUSION 😭😭😭😭
Did we get these characters for free! Or get by completeing missions! 😅😅😅😅
At 2:52 doesn't it look like an oceanid? Just playing earlier and it looks like when you look down from the eyes of one.
why childe is everywhere???
WHAT IS CHILDE DOING IN FONTAINE????
BioShock?
Is that Dottore in the ballon at the beginning ? 😭😂
Lmao why am i kaughing at childes appearance. Hes back lmaooo
Does it always have to be aether
Is no one going to give praise for focalor's VA? I personally think she nailed it, it suits the voice so much.
I’m just trying to theory my way through childe’s presence here, like why? There’s already a harbinger so are you helping us or is this another “hahaha lemma save you from jail time only to smack you through the floor” moment
Aaaaaa chilled 🥳 ( can we get some way to activate his Delusion? )
The Bell? ........ 😱
Am i the only one thinking fosalors pronounciation is weird? And childe is totally unnecessary here? I'd rather see other harbinger that has yet make an appearance.
'ekne-ledge' really focalors? i thought u was gonna do british accent or european at least
can any one tell me who is Navia‘s VA
Wait does something happen to Lynette?! Ive been so excited for the twins since the chapters trailer back at the vwry start of the game and now it looks like her dissapearance is a big part of the story 😢
New archon? Wonder if she has a dragon
Nah i was saving for raiden but i needa know what that electro gurl does shes 😮
So how are Childe and Arlecchino going to interact? He seems against the hydro archon, but Arlecchino is definitely pulling the strings behind the scenes. He also said he dislikes her, so maybe he's going to sabotage some of her efforts?
Still nothing about Resin? Current week bosses already took 3 days of resin, what now?
Why does Freminet sound so much like Tighnari and Focalors sounds very similar to Fischl
Why is dude wearing a garter belt? Why is mihoyo incapable of making male characters look like men? They have the females pretty much nailed.
So we greeted by Focalors herself, rather than guessing which one is the Archon? And she introduced herself with her divine name (Focalors) instead her personal name (Furina)? Previous archons never introduced themselves with their divine name.
So Traveller is on trial for possible murder or witnessing a murder? Also hello, Childe!? Its been soo long.
Where is childe’s vision?
The only question I need is: the Fontaine's sword is a HP one? we really need a F2P friendly!
Ok, where’s our long awaited Arlechinno?! Don’t make me wait 5 more months or more-
Why is Lumine never in these trailers? Not even in the promotional art.
Why Tartaglia doesn't have his vision?
Yeah, ok, but like, when is Natlan coming out?
is focalor the hydro archon?>
The fact theyve previously shown that Arlecchino is involved but have Childe revealed to actively show up in the trailer is so interesting, what are they setting up here 🤔 Like, we know the Fatui is after the Hydro Gnosis, obviously, but whats the angle if theyve got some sort of long term mastermind plot from Arlecchino and then Childe, known for the chaos he brings, also being added to the mix? Makes me wonder if hes actually meant to be involved at all...
I wonder whats wrong with the traveller at 3:55
Where is Xbox version?!
*y en que vercion se podra saltar los dialogos y cinematicas? que dan ganas de no jugar con tanto texto* *And in which version can you skip the dialogues and cinematics? that makes you want to not play with so much text*
bro already? It feels like yesterday
The first second i thought Lyney throw cards, but its his bow xD Twisted Fate? xD
I really curious about the main conflict
Will there be leviathan class life forms in this version of Subnautica?
Paimon playable character when?
how far am I behind if  the last thing I did was lantern rite.
Still waiting for a baguette to be a claymore
AAAA WHY IS LYNEY SO CUTTEEEE😭😭
HELP WHAT CHILDE???
WAIT WHY DOES CHILDE HAVE NO VISION, AM I BLIND OR SMT??
Why i was so sure fontaine were to look a lot like the water city from ffxv?
So they increase the amount of obtainable mora for Leylines and possible hero wits too? Can't wait for that =D
I was wondering what crime we'll be blamed for in Fontaine, guess we just found out lol
Childe finally getting a w maybe?
Now that Childe's back on the main questline, do you think Arlecchino is using him as Signora did before?
Why is the world of Teyvat so damn gorgeous? I can’t wait for this to be in the game so I can explore, Fountaine looks absolutely beautiful ❤❤
Is it me or us Chlorinde also fighting the mechs at the same time as Taylor Swift? From what I saw, I assumed the mechs were on the side of the court, so why would Chlorinde fight them?
Childe AGAIN? Now he dies or what
Wait, Tartaglia is come to Fontaine too?
Fontaine theme from genshin vs  Reverse 1999 lets see who has the best story.
So, Fontaine is so obsessed with legal cases being a soap opera that they've lost sight of all else? Sounds like how Ei was so obsessed with eternity that she just ignored all the chaos in her country.
why is no one talking about the character that can finally use "the bell" to its full potential
I've been playing genshin for like 10 months now and didn't yet unlock Inazuma. I've been more focused on leveling up my characters that I keep getting (for free), I hope I get to Fontaine soon.  Am I the only one getting "The Great Ace Attorney" feel?
hey where is Childe's vision?
Did the traveler talk in the trailer? Omg maybe he'll start talking more
I wonder though, why does it sound like rainfall is such a big deal? Is it not supposed to rain in Fontaine, the land of Hydro? 😭 Also the clock's hands at 3:24,   it's kinda stuck?? I wonder what that signifies. It's happening during the rainfall too 🤔
so is hydro traveler a healer?
How much GB will this cost me? 😭
what happened to Lynette?!
... Is that Navia using whiteblind? Are we getting female fontaine itto/another noelle? 🤔 I was expecting something unique... but I guess Genshin is just about to recycle him into a waifu/give us 5* Noelle. On another hand, I thought Clorinde was on the side of Chief Justice, but she's fighting the robots too, perhaps they went out of control? Also, childe doesn't have his vision? Wonder if it's intentional. Definitely interested in how the story will play out.
is this honkai impact? bc Genshin Impact changed a lot
WAIT A MIN ARE WE FIGHTING TWO HARBINGERS?!
Lover of Sneznaiyan queen is cheating with the lord of Fountaine? My my...  also..is it just the blue or the traveller has been made to look more attractive
skip cutscene when?
2:46 Why is there kingdom hearts in my Genshin Impact?
Where the Arlechino?
Am I the only one who watched the trailer like this 😮 from the beginning of showing lyney‘s playstyle until the end?
Bruh when are we gonna get a cryo catalyst user?!?!?😭😭😭
Geo claymore?
why did I scream when I saw Childe? lol
"finale" as in the end of the game? or the nation itself?
Can they really top Sumeru ?
5:39 a _pipe_ weapon?!?! i love that hoyo is getting more experimental w each and every new region!! we went from heizou to mika and now a gunwielding claymore and whoever wields a pipe as a sword in lore 🤩 super excited for this next journey for the traveler!!
1:25 can we talk about how cute lynnettes tada was??
Guys Why Turkish Translate is so goofy
3:37  what happened to Lynette?!😭😭😭
Can we renonce childe to be not a fatui anymore? Like he has such a good heart why is he part of people who seem so dark
Childe buff incoming?
WHO IS THAT GIRL WHO LOOK LIKE RAIDEN???
Why do i feel nothing in this trailer? Is it because of burnout?
is childes hydro vision missing or am i the only one trippin???
is it just me or is that part of collei's theme at 1:35? is that like a house of the hearth motif possibly?
Size of update?
Did anyone else notice that Tartaglia didn't have his Hydro Vision in the trailer?😅
Does this region remind anyone else of honkai? Like the outfits and characters especially
when will this update come?
is it just me that hates the hydro archon?
hello did Lynette just vanish from that water tank what—
3:57  Anyone notice Aether here?
NAVIA IS A CLAYMORE USER????
Will The Bell stonk?
Back to genshin again? Ehmm
How many times you saw this teaser? Me: Yes
Bro childe has enough death flags idk if Fontaine is gonna be it guys 💀 (out of 9 harbingers that can appear, he does again, coincidence? I think NOT)
Clorinde is so damn hot despite having barely 5 seconds of screentime, also did they pretty much recycled anemo skills for hydro? the tornado and hand blast is such a pissfart idk why they make it look so similar
Is Childe helping the traveler or he got into his own mess?
Water 7 Arc?
Why do we keep breaking the law in every new country we visit XD
4:20 Where is his vision..?
Idk why I'm excited to see childe in the trailer more than the fountaine itself😂
2:09 Do we finally have someone who can actually use the Bell? lol
freminet and albedo same voice actor ?
Is it just me or did this reveal trailer give yall a sense of unease within genshin's story
the people saving the traveller from their archon now?
what is neuvilette's weapon huhu
I neeeeeed to know which weapon Focalors uses
3:43 It’s cool that Childe’s coming back, but why do I feel like they’re already planning on offing Lynette this early in her release?
Navia is claymore user??
will childe save us or something? this trailer is so cool
Wait so like if Focalar dissolves everyone into water because they are guilty would that make that water bad which pollutes fountaine?
YOOO WHY DID THEY SNAP ON THE SOUNDTRACK🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1:55 Could this be Albedo?
Are we going to become fugitives again?
Me is Childe on our side this time????
Hmmm Navia is a Geo Claymore??
We fighting god again? LET US MOVE
Did lynette die? Cause i swear she just dissolved into water does this confirmed that at the mid of the story she'll die too?
For the billion dollar question, WHAT IS CHILDE DOING IN FONTAINE!!!!??????
when is 4.0 coming?
Has anyone else realized that Childe is missing his vision
Is Childe the anime protagonist?
Seeing Childe reminds me, I wonder if Yanfei will help us in Fontaine, since she is a lawyer after all…🤔
I need answers on why Childe was in the trailer
is it just me or does the audio sounds a bit funky
4:00 who is she? :O
4:03 gun where?
where is arlecchino?
“What’s ur favorite claymore in genshin?” “talking stick” might as well wish for it on the special rock in windrise
3:56 why does it look like traveller is hurt or something here🥹 and the fact that he's the only one kneeling down and paimon looks worried
Not sure what to think about this. Absolutely burnout with this game and if this version still doesn't buff Geo element, still no skip dialogue button, unnecessarily long stories and sh1tty rng rate, im so sure to sell my account.
Are you ready for French Revolution guys???🗣🗣🗣
So the story is kinda like a law revolution or something? 😂
Anyone saw the bell & Iron sting in the trailer so are they Fontaine origin then
WHAT'S.... TARTAGLIA?!
Childe always has one of the best comebacks. He really never disappoints. Either way what is his  name this time during his rerun?😂
Why Childe? 11 fatui harbinger and they put him again? I hope he has a good motive to be there and steal screen time for other characters otherwise i will be pissed.
will this time the path of the nation wont be able to be saved by the traveler?
4:38 Why the sand streaks tho? Is stealing the Sumeru desert part of the big plan to not sink?💀
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT FREMINET USING THE BELL? FINALLY THAT WEAPON IS GOING TO BE USEFUL!!!
When its come?
TEN new 4 star weapons?  Are they finally updating the standard banner or Paimon's Bargains?  Maybe the battlepass?
Where's Wriothesley and Sigeweine?
WAIT, what about version 3.9??
THE MUSIC?? IT’S SO GOOD
DID CHILDE CAME TO HELP US??
4:04 is Genshin finally getting owns own Seele? Or not..I see no iconic highlights
Did anyone notice that Navia is holding either Whiteblind or Iron sting if you slow the video down? Also idk but Clorinde is giving major " enforcer " vibes like Cyno and Raiden on the clock if ya'll know
what is child is  doing
Bro where is Arlecchino why tf am I seeing childe again noooo
Why does Focalors sound like Fischl?
TARTAGLIA??!!!
Can somebody please tell me when is the version coming out?
who is the hydro archon ? dont tell me uchiha madara
Wth is ginger head is doing here
Is Focalors played by Fischl?
Nadia holding a claymore??!!
We had scaramouche for flying and now finally freminet for underwater exploration!! I wonder if it's possible to grind down there... hmm??
Free characters when? Free weapon when?
What, is Childe going to help the player?  Mihoyo is really trying to make people forget that whole "trying to nuke a city full of civilians in the form of an ancient evil monster for the lolz" thing he pulled when they first introduced him.
I don’t know if my phone can make it and I don’t want to delete genshin 😭
Sandrone why?!?!?!?!?😔🥲
Why is Childe here? God! Take a hint, stop trying to shove Childe down our throat!
Is no one going to talk about the robot guards?😳
Who else here isn't caught up with the Sumeru storyline bc of Genshin burnout? 😭
Waiting that arrlechino will be playable character or not
Is this gonna be another, the Archon is the problem quest lines
And here I was, 2 weeks before fontaine wondering if I should get Kokofish. Guess she'll have to wait.
Did the Tsaritsa ran out of operating Harbinger?? Gotta start recruiting little Timmy soon cuz Childe will soon be the new Mr. Worldwide lmao
Wait, where is Tartaglia vision?
Did anyone notice focalors crying at around 0:11?
What if this is Arlecchino's plot and once again Childe becomes clown?😢
Did I hear some Traveler Voice Acting at one Point???
Does anyone know what the music is 3:26-4:20. I did not find
''IM... wait... who am i?'' bro was ready for epic villain voiceline
So oceanids left fontaine because the water made them lose their memories?
I can't believe it that Childe was return i wonder why, is he on with the Traveler side or not, and also why he really needs a robot to charge it? I mean that was a thaw.
why
What if Lynette going missing is just part of Arlecchinos plan to get rid of the traveler or something. Since she was practice with them in the teaser
cryo catalyst when?
Wtf tartaglia? Why is he there??!?😭
Why neuvillette look dangerous than hydro archon?
Even Tartaglia join as well?!
WHY NOONE TOLD ME HOW FREMINETT VOICE JUST GSHSHDG
CHILDE’S PART OF THE MAIN STORY?? AND WHY DOES NEUVILETTE HATE US 😭
ANOTHER CIVIL WAR?
I wonder if there will be anemo ally will save the traveller this time
Childe redemption arc? 👀
WHERE DID TARTAGLIA COME FROM
WHY NAVIA IS NOT A MAGE THAT USES HER UMBRELLA ????????????????????
can we talk about the prophecy? LIKE IS THAT FOCALOR'S DOING, OR MAYBE SHE DID SOMETHING SO THE HIGHER UPS (HEAVENLY PRINCIPLES) DROWN HER NATION?
god damnt it why the traveller treated like an international criminal ?
Childe to the rescue? Is he going there without other Harbingers knowing or against their orders?
Wait Furina is tall? i tought she was a Loli
new mommies!?!?!?!?
I am blown away by all the character designs and the gorgeous architecture and the dancing steampunk robots have me so intrigued.....but why the HECK can't the NA localization team seem to get the name pronunciations right??? First with Tartaglia (it's an Italian name, pronouncing the G is a CRIME get Fontaine's lil justice brigade on THAT why don't you?) and now "Foh-suh-lore???" Are you serious??? Since it's based on French it should be a hard C and the R wouldn't be pronounced unless an E came after it. The JPN dub managed to get the hard C right...but apparently the EN dubbing company can't even pay their VAs in a timely manner despite the money Hoyoverse gives them, so I can't exactly say I'm surprised.  And this is why I will never switch off of the original CN audio, even if I like some of the English VAs' performances.
Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift!?
very excited!! but where is arlecchino?
Hold up CHILDE?
Wait excuse me? Tartaglia is returning?!
Idk if genshin will take the risk this time of a playable character dying and we'll wonder if it's still for show or they're gone for real
Is that a sword version of Whiteblind that the Electro girl is holding..... Also Harbingers vs Traveler vs Fontaine.... let's see how it goes
guess whos back on genshin after 3 months
Omg! I haven’t played Genshin for awhile now. Is Childe now part of the main story quest again? Where’s the Fatui Lady? I heard she’s the villain of this arc
How they gonna make Natlan better than this? By making us chug a potion of fire resistance and swim in lava?
Childe making an appearance in another archon quest??
Childe is back ?!
Rain in the city?
why do we keep becoming a wanted crimnal?
those guards wearing tuxedo and using a sword just doesn't fit together 😂 where's the Guns fontain
will Childe vs Arlechinno??
I am confuse is Childe the main character or us?
Okay but wtf is going on with the traveler, why's he bugging back there
Why does it feel like Tart has a death flag looming over him very prominently right now....
What the childe doing?
What da childe doing?? 😂😂
What is Childe doing there 😂
Is it just me or does the judge have a baby face?
@3:59 So Taylor Swift is a claymore user? I really hope she wasn't T^T.
now just what the hell is childe doin here😭
What does Child a Fontaine do?
Fosalor??? What? Why did she pronounce it so weird?
why the hell is childe in fontaine
Are those underwater levels? My favorite! I can't wait to ignore them -.-
Is the one ask:"Who am I?" the previous archon?
Am I the only one who’s worrying about my phone storage💀💀💀
So Traveler becomes a wanted person again? 😂
Childe back in story? I guess i can finally be somewhat excited for the new story
Wasn't version 2 point something the other day..? Like.. we're in 4 already.. it's 2023.. time is going so fast and this is just getting more and more exciting for mee. 🎮🎧🌷✨
Is it just me who feels like childe is gonna die sometime in the story…
Everyone excited for Version 4.0?  I know I am. 😎
Childe gonna be our savior again??... 🎉
Nice new weapons 😆 Hold up is that a pipe..💀
Oh we're on trial? I did not see that coming
Im I the only one who noticed something at 4:39 ?! Like WHY?!?! did they change the style?! . When Inazuma and Sumeru's Trailers came out, the ending/outro have been just the name of the update and a dark background with the theme of the region and element. And now it's just normal... . I love the art I really do, but I prefer the old ones...
Bro did Lynette just disappear out of nowhere?
What the children doing
navia claymore, itto power creep? clorinde on iron sting why? also WHERE'S ARLECHINO 😑😑😑😵😵
Why do I feel that Focalors' style of speech seems a bit arrogant? And cold laws? So i guess the story will be about revolution
somebody explain to me how does hanabi network uploaded this before the official genshin impact
I wonder if I will be able to see the end of this game before I die XD
0:40 what the f kind of question is that? A person's life and future hangs in the balance, and you're treating it like it's some kind of exciting performance put up for your amuzement? I can already tell I won't like this nation
4:20 Childe's vision is missing, is that why he's using his Delusion to fight here?
i think we can finally get some good quality story?
When it s coming please ?
I just notice that at 3:43 Lynette turned into water...  Furina, why did u do this :c
why do i have this nagging feeling childe is going to die
Wait i got really scared, what happened to Lynette?! 😭
What's this??? New map???
Is this about hydro archon?
Why is it always ather
Why is no one's talking about how glamorous and majestic the two ice dancers meka is
Who is the voice of Navia?🤔
Ed Sheeran and Taylor swift x Genshin collab ?!
WHAT IS CHILDE DOING THERE!? HELLO???
Am I the only one who does not feel any hype? It's just new quests and maps...
wait what is childe doing in fontaine
Lynette is alive right?
Why is she crying and enjoying it at the same time
Is childe will come to Fontaine for buy souvenir for Teucer?
Am I the only one who noticed how the traveler pulls out his sword and falls to his knees?  At this moment, for some reason, red sparks come out of his body.
Childe's vision where?😀 4:19
Are we finally getting some Childe vs Child action?
Wait?... Tartaglia?! Reminds me of the luyie archon quest
I remember while doing childe story quest he mentioned his family loves in Fontaine right? So him being ennobled should be natural right??
Not that I dislike childe but... why? We havent finished dottore yet
Surely Childe will not die, right?
THEY HAVE A HILICHURL CURSE? EXCUSE ME?????
Oh god... Childe is on the good side with us? 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Are we about to witness the French Revolution?
why is childe always fighting someone
Story better do a step up in the right direction, seems promising so far! Wonder why childe is there..
So the mission is goinge to be either centered in khaenriah or another mission? Seeing as i dont think "uncovering the secrets of a nation" means fontaine  I think the greeting will be to one of the fatui, not the traveler
Childe really is Mr. Worldwide, huh?
OMG CHILDE!! WHAT U GONNA DO?! WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN?! IT'S GOT ME CHILLS I'M SO EXCITED
Don’t know if I’m excited… or worried about storage space…
What the Atomic Heart is going on here? I'm all for it!
What the Heck Ajax doing there? And our Archon is bratty
CHILDE IS BACK?!
